Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is `bets` - 2, `ans` is the string value of `a[i]` followed by a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the variable `ans` by appending the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the current value of `ans`. The value of `i` is updated to `bets - 2` because `i` was initially `bets - 1` and no other changes were made to `i`. The initial conditions for `bets` and `i` remain unchanged except for the decrement in `i`.
