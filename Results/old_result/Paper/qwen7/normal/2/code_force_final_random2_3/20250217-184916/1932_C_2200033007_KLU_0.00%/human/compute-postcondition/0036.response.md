Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `p` is equal to `p` multiplied by the next value of `v` in the reversed sequence of `b`.
- `ans` contains `[p * v, p]`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for v in reversed(b):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over the reversed sequence of `b`.
- At each iteration, `v` takes the next value from the reversed sequence of `b`.
- `p` is updated by multiplying it with the current value of `v`.
- `ans` is updated to contain `[p * v, p]`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Determine the Next Value of `v`:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over the reversed sequence of `b`, the next value of `v` will be the next element in the reversed sequence.
   
2. **Update `p`:**
   - `p` is updated by multiplying it with the next value of `v`.

3. **Update `ans`:**
   - `ans` is updated to contain `[p * v, p]`.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `p` will be updated to `p * next_v` (where `next_v` is the next value of `v`).
- `ans` will be updated to `[p * v, p]`.

Given that the previous iteration ended with `p` being multiplied by the current `v` and `ans` containing `[p * v, p]`, the next value of `v` will be the next element in the reversed sequence of `b`.

### Example Calculation
If the previous value of `v` was the first element in the reversed sequence, then the next value of `v` will be the second element in the reversed sequence.

### Final Answer
State: **`p` is equal to `p` multiplied by the next value of `v` in the reversed sequence of `b`, `ans` contains `[p * v, p]` where `v` is the next value in the reversed sequence of `b`.**

To be more specific, if we denote the next value of `v` as `next_v`, then:

State: **`p` is equal to `p * next_v`, `ans` contains `[p * v, p]` where `next_v` is the next value in the reversed sequence of `b`.**

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`p` is equal to `p * next_v`, `ans` contains `[p * v, p]`**
