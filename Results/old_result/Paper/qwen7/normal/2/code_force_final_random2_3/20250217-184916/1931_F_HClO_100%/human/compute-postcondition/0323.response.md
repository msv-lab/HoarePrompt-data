Postcondition: **`val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, and the length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`. At the start of the next iteration, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`, and if `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
