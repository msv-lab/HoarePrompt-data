Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int type, and stores them in a list named `palka`. The original values of `t`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged.
