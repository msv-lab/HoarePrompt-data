Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `elem`, which iterates over the elements of `lst`.

2. **Understand the initial states**:
   - `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.
   - `final` now contains the first element of `lst`.
   - `elem` is the first element of `lst`.

3. **Determine the changes after one iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `elem` will be set to the second element of `lst`.
   - `mini` remains unchanged because it is based on the values of `lst` before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.
   - `final` remains unchanged because it is initialized to the first element of `lst` and does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `mini` stays as it is because it is determined before the loop starts and does not depend on the current value of `elem`.
   - `final` stays as it is because it is initialized to the first element of `lst` and does not change within the loop.
   - `elem` changes to the second element of `lst`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` now contains the first element of `lst`, and `elem` is the second element of `lst`**.
