Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while cnt and l < n + 1:`. The variables involved here are `cnt` and `l`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The condition `cnt and l < n + 1` means both `cnt` must be truthy (non-zero) and `l` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Before the loop, `cnt` is `k` and `l` is 1.

3. **Check each variable**:
   - For `l`: It is already 1, which is less than `n + 1` (assuming `n` is a non-negative integer). Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `l`.
   - For `cnt`: It is `k`. For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be truthy (non-zero). If `k` is zero, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure `k` is non-zero.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `l` is already set to 1, no adjustment is needed for `l`.
   - We need to ensure `cnt` is non-zero.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `cnt` must be non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is 1**
