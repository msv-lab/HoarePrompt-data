Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0; `heap` is an empty list; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `prices` is a list returned by `func_2()` and `n` is the return value of `func_2()` and `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`**.

This means that the `prices` variable now holds a list generated by the `func_2()` function, while the values of `test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
