Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is a non-negative integer, if `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains the elements 1 and 1, if `lex` is between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the value 26 and 1, if `lex` is 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged and contains the element 1.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the value 1 to the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` initially contains the element 1. If `lex` is between 27 and 52 (exclusive), `arr` initially contains the value 26. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` remains unchanged and contains the element 1. In all cases, after executing the code, `arr` will contain an additional element 1.
