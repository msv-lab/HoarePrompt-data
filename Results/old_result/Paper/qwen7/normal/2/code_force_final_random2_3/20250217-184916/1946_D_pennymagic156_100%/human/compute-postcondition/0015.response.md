Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. Here's what each part does:
- `val >> i & 1` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with 1. This effectively extracts the `i`-th bit of `val`.
- `op ^= ...` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of the above expression.

Since the initial values of `val`, `i`, and `op` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `op`. However, we know that `op` is updated according to the given expression. The list `a` remains unchanged.
