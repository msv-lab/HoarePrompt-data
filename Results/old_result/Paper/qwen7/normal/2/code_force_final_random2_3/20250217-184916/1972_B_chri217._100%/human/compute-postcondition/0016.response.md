Output State: **The program returns a list named 'cases' which contains 't' tuples. Each tuple consists of the last values of 'n' and 's' read from stdin for each of the 't' test cases. After all iterations, 't' is reduced to 0.**

This means that after processing all test cases, the list `cases` will hold `t` tuples, each representing the last `n` and `s` values read for each test case. The variable `t` will be 0 because it started as the number of test cases and was decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reached 0.
