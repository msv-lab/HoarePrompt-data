Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 0, `zero_perc` is 50.**

Explanation: Initially, `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 50, and `one_perc` is 0 because `s[i]` equals '0'. The code updates `zero_perc` to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Given `zero` is 2 and `i` is 2, `zero_perc` becomes `math.ceil(2 * 100 / (2 + 1)) = math.ceil(200 / 3) = 67`. However, since the initial condition of `zero_perc` is already 50 and the calculation does not change it, `zero_perc` remains 50. All other variables remain unchanged.
