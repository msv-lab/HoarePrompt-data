Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers (with one element processed), `ai` is `val` ^ 0, `t` is a list containing two elements both equal to 0, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> ai & 1`**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. Initially, `ai` was 0, so after the operation, `ai` becomes `val` ^ 0, which simplifies to `val`. The other variables remain unchanged.
