Postcondition: **The input value is decremented by 1, and `s` is the decremented input value as a string. If the length of the set of characters in `s` is 1 and the length of `s` is greater than 1, then the function does nothing. Otherwise, `s` becomes a string obtained by taking all characters of `s` except the first one and appending the first character of `s` to the end.**
