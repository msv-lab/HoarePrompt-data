Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is a positive integer.
- `k` is `k + 1`, but since `k` itself is not defined in the initial state, we only know that it has been incremented by 1.
- `x` is the first integer input from the user.
- `y` is the second integer input from the user.

The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
