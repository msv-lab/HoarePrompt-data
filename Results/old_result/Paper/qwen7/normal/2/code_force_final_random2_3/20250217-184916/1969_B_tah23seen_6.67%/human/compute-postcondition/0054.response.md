Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Conditions**: The loop continues as long as the following conditions are met:
   - `left <= right`
   - `right < len(s)`
   - `left < len(s)`

2. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `left` is 10
   - `s[6]` is not '1'
   - `len(s)` must be at least 9

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to continue, `left` must be less than `len(s)`. Since `left` is currently 10, and `len(s)` is at least 9, `left` cannot be incremented further without violating the condition `left < len(s)`.
   - Therefore, `left` must be adjusted to a value that satisfies the loop condition. The smallest possible value for `left` that satisfies `left < len(s)` is 11 (assuming `len(s)` is exactly 9, but since `len(s)` must be at least 9, it could be greater).

4. **Adjust Other States**:
   - The state of `s[6]` being not '1' remains unchanged because it does not affect the loop continuation.
   - The state of `len(s)` being at least 9 remains unchanged because it does not affect the loop continuation.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `left`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`left` must be 11, `s[6]` is not '1', and `len(s)` must be at least 9**
