Output State: **`password` is the substring of the original `password` starting from the third character; `char` is the second character of the original `password`; `digits` is updated by appending `char` to it.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `char` to the list `digits`.
- `char` is the second character of the original `password`.
- `password` is the remaining substring of the original `password` after removing the first character.
- The state of `letters` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
