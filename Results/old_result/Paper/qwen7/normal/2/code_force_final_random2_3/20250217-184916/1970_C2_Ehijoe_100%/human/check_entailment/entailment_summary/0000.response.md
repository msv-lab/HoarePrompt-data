Reasoning:
1. The problem description states that there is only one round (t=1) and the task is to determine the winner based on whether Ron can make a move from the starting node.
2. The `func_2` function correctly reads the input values for the number of nodes (n) and the starting node (start).
3. It constructs the tree using a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors.
4. It identifies the leaf nodes using a deque.
5. The function then calls `func_1` to check if Ron can make a move from the starting node.
6. `func_1` correctly checks if the starting node has more than one neighbor (excluding the parent). If it does, it returns `True` indicating Ron can make a move. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
7. Based on the result of `func_1`, the function correctly prints "Ron" or "Hermione".

Given the above points, the implementation of both functions aligns with the problem description and the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
