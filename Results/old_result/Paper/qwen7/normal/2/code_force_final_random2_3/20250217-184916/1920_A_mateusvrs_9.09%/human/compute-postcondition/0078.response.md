Output State: **`bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is a set containing `x` if `a` is not equal to 1, otherwise `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx` (which is -1). The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is only mentioned to be greater than 1. The value of `cx` is not affected unless `a` is not equal to 1, in which case it will contain `x`. The values of `ax`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are reassigned to input integers but their values are not specified in the initial state.
