Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is the input integer that must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the updated string `s`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
