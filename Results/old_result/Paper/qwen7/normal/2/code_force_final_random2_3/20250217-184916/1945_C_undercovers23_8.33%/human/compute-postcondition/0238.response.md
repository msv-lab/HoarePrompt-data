Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` will be updated to the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst` during the loop, and `final` will contain all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`.**

In this final output state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference found between `pk` and any element in `lst`. The `final` list will contain all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`. If no such elements exist, `final` will remain an empty list.
