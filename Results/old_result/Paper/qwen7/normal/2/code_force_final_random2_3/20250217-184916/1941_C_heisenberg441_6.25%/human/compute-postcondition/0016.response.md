Output State: **`ans` is 3, `s` contains the substring 'pi'**

Explanation: The code replaces the substring 'pie' in `s` with nothing (essentially removing it). Since `s` originally contained the substring 'pie', after the operation, the first two characters 'pi' remain, and the rest of the string following 'pie' is removed. Therefore, `s` now contains only 'pi'. The value of `ans` remains unchanged.
