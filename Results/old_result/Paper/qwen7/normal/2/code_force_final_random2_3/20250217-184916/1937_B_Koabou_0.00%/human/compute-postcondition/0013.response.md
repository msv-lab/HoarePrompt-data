Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the original input integer, the second element is the new input integer, the third element is another input integer, and the fourth element is yet another input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0, `i` is 0, and the condition `a[0][i + 1]` is equal to '1' and `a[1][i]` is equal to '0'.
