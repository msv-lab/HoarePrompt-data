Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are the integers from the input split, `m` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
