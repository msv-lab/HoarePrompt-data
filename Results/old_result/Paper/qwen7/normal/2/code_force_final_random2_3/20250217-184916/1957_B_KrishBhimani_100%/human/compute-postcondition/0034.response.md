Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list containing one element which is \((1 << i) - 1\), and `temp` is such that `temp * 2 \>= k`**.

Explanation: The code appends \((1 << i) - 1\) to the list `ans`. Here, \((1 << i)\) represents \(2^i\). Therefore, \((1 << i) - 1\) is a binary number consisting of `i` consecutive 1s. Since `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it became at least `k`, \((1 << i) - 1\) is the largest number less than \(2^i\) that has `i` consecutive 1s. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
