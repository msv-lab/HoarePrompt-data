Output State: **`ans` is 2, `s` is the substring from the start of `s` to the character before 'm', followed by the substring from the character after 'p' to the end of `s`.**

Explanation: The code replaces the substring 'map' in `s` with its parts excluding 'm' and 'a'. Since `s` must contain the substring 'map', let's denote the part of `s` before 'm' as `pre_m` and the part after 'p' as `post_p`. Thus, `s` is updated to `pre_m + post_p`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 2.
