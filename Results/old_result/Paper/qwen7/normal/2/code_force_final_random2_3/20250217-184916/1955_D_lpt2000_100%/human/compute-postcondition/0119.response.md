Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` remains unchanged, `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged if `D[out_aa] > 0` and `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `D[in_aa]` has been incremented by 1. The values of `C[out_aa]`, `pairs_in_D`, and `D[out_aa]` (if `D[out_aa] > 0` and `E[out_aa] > 0`) remain unchanged. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` is also greater than 0, then `out_aa` is not affected. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.
