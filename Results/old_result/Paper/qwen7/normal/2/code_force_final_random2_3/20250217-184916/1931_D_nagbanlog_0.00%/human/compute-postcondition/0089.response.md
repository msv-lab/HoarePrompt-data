Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `case['params']` retains its original value, `results` retains its original value, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, and `required_mod_y` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_y` to `num % y`. All other variables retain their original values unless specified otherwise. If the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the `freq` dictionary, `beautiful_count` is incremented by the corresponding value in `freq`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.
