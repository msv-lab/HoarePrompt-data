Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with the next `val`, and `val` is the next element from `a`.
   - `ai` is updated to be the current `ai` XORed with the next `val`.
   - `t` is a list containing one additional element which is the updated `ai`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `val` in the list `a`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, the variable `val` will be the next element from the list `a`.
   - The variable `ai` will be updated to be the current `ai` XORed with the next `val`.
   - The list `t` will contain one additional element which is the updated `ai`.

Given these points, let's determine the new states:

- **`a`:** Since `val` is the next element from `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list, `a` remains the same.
- **`val`:** This is the next element from `a` that will be processed in the next iteration.
- **`ai`:** This will be updated to be the current `ai` XORed with the next `val`.
- **`t`:** This list will contain one additional element which is the updated `ai`.

Since the list `a` is non-empty and the loop continues until all elements are processed, the list `a` itself does not change but `val` changes to the next element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with the next `val`, and `val` is the next element from `a`; `ai` is updated to be the current `ai` XORed with the next `val`, and `t` is a list containing two additional elements which are the updated `ai` and the next `val`**.

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the correct answer should reflect the updated values of `val` and `ai`:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with the next `val`, and `val` is the next element from `a`; `ai` is updated to be the current `ai` XORed with the next `val`, and `t` is a list containing one additional element which is the updated `ai`**.
