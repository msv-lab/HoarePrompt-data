Postcondition: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer with the value 2, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2. The index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
