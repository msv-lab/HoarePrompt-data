The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( m \) such that \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \) and \( n + m \) does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^6 \). For each test case, it calls another function `func_1()`. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the initial integer \( t \) (indicating the number of test cases) is greater than 2. The function does not return any value.
