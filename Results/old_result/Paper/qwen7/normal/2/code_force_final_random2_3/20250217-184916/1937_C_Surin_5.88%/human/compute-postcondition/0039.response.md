Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` generates numbers from 1 up to but not including `n`).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `r` is the string `'>'.
   - `prev` is equal to `i`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n-1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - `n` must remain at least 2.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be `n` (since it was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration and needs to be incremented).
   - `n` remains at least 2.
   - `r` and `prev` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `r` is the string '>', `prev` is equal to `i`, and `i` is `n`**.
