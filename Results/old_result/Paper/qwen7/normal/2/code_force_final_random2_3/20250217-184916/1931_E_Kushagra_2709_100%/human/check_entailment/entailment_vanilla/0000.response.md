Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Players take turns.
   - Anna reverses the digits of an element.
   - Sasha concatenates two elements and removes one.
   - The game ends when only one element remains, and Sasha wins if it is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The game's outcome depends on the length of the remaining numbers.
   - Sasha wins if the last remaining number has a length of at least \(m+1\) (since \(10^m\) has \(m+1\) digits).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates whether Sasha or Anna wins.
   - It sums the lengths of the numbers after reversing Anna's moves.
   - It sorts the zero counts of the numbers in descending order and subtracts every second value from the total length.

4. **Function `zerocnts`:**
   - This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number.
   - It converts the number to a string and counts the number of trailing zeros.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

- **Summing Lengths:**
  - The sum of the lengths of the numbers after Anna's moves is calculated using `tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`.
  - This part is correct because it accounts for the lengths of the numbers after they might have been reversed.

- **Sorting Zero Counts:**
  - `cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)` sorts the zero counts in descending order.
  - This step is unnecessary for determining the final length of the numbers but might be intended to help in some optimization.

- **Subtracting Every Second Value:**
  - The loop `for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):` iterates over every second value in the sorted list and subtracts it from `tot`.
  - This subtraction is intended to simulate Sasha's concatenation moves, but it is not directly related to the actual lengths of the numbers.

- **Winning Condition:**
  - The function returns `'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'`.
  - This condition checks if the total length is at least \(m+1\), which is correct for determining Sasha's win.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the total length of the numbers after Anna's moves. The sorting and zero count calculations are unnecessary but do not affect the correctness of the winning condition.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
