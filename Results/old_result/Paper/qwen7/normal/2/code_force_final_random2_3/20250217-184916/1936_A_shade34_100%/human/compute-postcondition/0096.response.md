Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mak` is `len(pans) - 2`
   - `i` is `len(pans) - 2`
   - `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`
   - `mak2` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - The current value of the input string is '<'

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(pans) - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `len(pans) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `mak` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(pans) - 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

5. **Final State**:
   - `mak` is `len(pans) - 2`
   - `i` is `len(pans) - 1`
   - `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`
   - `mak2` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - The current value of the input string is '<'

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`mak` is `len(pans) - 2`, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and the current value of the input string is '<'**
