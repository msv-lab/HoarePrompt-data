Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function `input = sys.stdin.read` is assigned to the variable `input`.**

The code simply assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`, which does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
