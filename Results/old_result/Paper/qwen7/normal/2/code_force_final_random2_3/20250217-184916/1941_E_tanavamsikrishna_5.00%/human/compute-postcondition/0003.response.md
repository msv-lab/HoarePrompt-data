Output State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, `rows` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells; `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.**

Explanation: The line `total_costs = []` initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. This does not affect the values of `rows` or `costs`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `rows` and `costs` while adding the new information about `total_costs`.
