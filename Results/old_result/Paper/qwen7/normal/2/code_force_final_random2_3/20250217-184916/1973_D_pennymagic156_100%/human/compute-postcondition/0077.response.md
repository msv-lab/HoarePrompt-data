Output State: **`cnt` is `k - 1` and `cnt` must be non-zero; `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than `n + 1` and `func_2()` must return a value less than `n - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` to `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` returns a value less than `n - 1`, adding 1 to this value ensures that `l` is still less than `n`. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, the conditions for `cnt` and `l` remain the same as the initial state, just with `l` updated to `func_2() + 1`.
