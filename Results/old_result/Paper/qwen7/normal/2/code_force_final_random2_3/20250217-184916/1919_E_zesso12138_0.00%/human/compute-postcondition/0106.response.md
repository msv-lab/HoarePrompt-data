Postcondition: `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\), and `j` is \(k + 1\); if \(j - 1 \geq 0\), then `new_dp[j - 1]` is unchanged and `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\), and `i` is \(2 \times n + 2\); if \(j - 1 < 0\), then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\), and `i` is \(2 \times n + 2\).
