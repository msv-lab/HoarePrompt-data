Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`. Therefore, the relevant variables are `cnt`, `l`, and `n`.

2. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `cnt` is equal to `k`.
   - `i` is `2`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 3`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute, both parts of the condition `cnt and l < n + 1` must be true.
   - `cnt` must be non-zero (i.e., `cnt != 0`).
   - `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Check the current state of `l`**:
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 3`.
   - We don't know the exact value of `func_2()`, but we need `l` to be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `l` is defined as `func_2() + 3`, we need to ensure that `func_2() + 3 < n + 1`.
   - This means `func_2()` must be less than `n - 2`.

6. **Final state before the loop**:
   - `cnt` must be non-zero (`cnt != 0`).
   - `l` must be less than `n + 1` (`l < n + 1`).

Given these conditions, the final state before the loop should be:

State: **`cnt` is `k` and `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is `func_2() + 3` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`**
