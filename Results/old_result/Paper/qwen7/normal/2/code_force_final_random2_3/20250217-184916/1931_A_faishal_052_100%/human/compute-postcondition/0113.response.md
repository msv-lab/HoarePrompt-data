Output State: **`j` must take on the values 0 and 1, and the value of `lex` is less than 28; `arr` contains the element 1**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `arr`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `j` still must take on the values 0 and 1, and `lex` is still less than 28. The list `arr` now contains the element `1`.
