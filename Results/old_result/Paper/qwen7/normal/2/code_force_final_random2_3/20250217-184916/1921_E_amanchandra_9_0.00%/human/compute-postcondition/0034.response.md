Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers from the input, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, `r` are integers with their previous values, `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2.**

This means that the variable `l` is now set to the maximum value between 1 and `yb - x`. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
