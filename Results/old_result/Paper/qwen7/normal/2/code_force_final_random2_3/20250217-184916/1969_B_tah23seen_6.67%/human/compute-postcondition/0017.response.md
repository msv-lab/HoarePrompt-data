Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `right < len(s) and s[right] != '0'`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `left` is 1
   - `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`
   - `cost` is `right - left + 1`
   - `right` is 0
   - The length of `s` must be at least 2

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'` must be true.

4. **Check the current state**:
   - `right` is currently 0.
   - We need to ensure that `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `right` is 0, we need to ensure that `0 < len(s)` and `s[0] != '0'`.
   - Given that the length of `s` must be at least 2, `len(s) > 0` is already satisfied.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `s[0] != '0'`.

So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `s[0]` should not be '0'.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`left` is 1, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - left + 1`, `right` is 0, and the length of `s` must be at least 2, and `s[0]` must not be '0'**
