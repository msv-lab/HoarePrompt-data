Postcondition: **`m` must be at least 4, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, where `a3` is the first integer from the input for each iteration, and `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the input for each iteration. The current value of `l3` is not equal to a list of all integers in `l` excluding `a3`.**
