Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `tree` is a list containing `u` and `v`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `tree`. Initially, `tree` contains only the value of `u`. After appending `v`, `tree` will contain both `u` and `v`. The values of `n`, `u`, `i`, and the new value added to `tree` (which is `v`) are updated accordingly.
