Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `l` is 1; `r` is n - 2; `sumk` is 0; `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sumk`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. The value of `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, where `l` is 1, so `k` is now `k - 2 * a[1]`.
