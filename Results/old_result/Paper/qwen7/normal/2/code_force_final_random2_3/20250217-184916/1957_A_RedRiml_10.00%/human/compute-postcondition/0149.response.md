Output State: **`shapes` is increased by 1, `d[j]` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `d` is a list of integers, and `j` is the next index in `pl`.**

Explanation: The code `shapes += 1` increments the value of `shapes` by 1. The other variables (`d[j]`, `d`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition that `j` is the next index in `pl` is also preserved.
