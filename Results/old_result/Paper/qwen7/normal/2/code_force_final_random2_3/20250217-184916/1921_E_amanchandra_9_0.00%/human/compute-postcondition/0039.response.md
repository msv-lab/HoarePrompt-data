Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` itself is not used in the print statement).
   - `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers from the input.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
   ```

To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the expression inside the `print` function:

- The expression `[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x]` evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
- If it evaluates to `True`, the list `['Bob']` will be selected.
- If it evaluates to `False`, the list `['Draw']` will be selected.

So, the `print` statement will print either `'Draw'` or `'Bob'` depending on the condition.

To determine which one will be printed, we need to evaluate the condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`:

- `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`.
- `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.

Given these definitions, let's consider the possible values:

- If `abs(l - yb) <= x` is true, then `l` must be within `x` distance from `yb`.
- Similarly, if `abs(r - yb) <= x` is true, then `r` must also be within `x` distance from `yb`.

If both conditions are true, then the expression `[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x]` will evaluate to `True`, and `'Bob'` will be printed.

If either condition is false, then the expression will evaluate to `False`, and `'Draw'` will be printed.

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `x`, and `yb` are not specified, we cannot definitively say whether the condition is true or false. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `'Draw'` or `'Bob'`.

Output: **['Draw', 'Bob'][abs(max(1, ya - x) - yb) <= x and abs(min(w, yb + x) - yb) <= x]**
