Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is either 'peak' if `y` is greater than `z', or 'none'**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain as new random integers between 1 and 9, and the condition for `res` (whether it is 'peak' or 'none') also remains unchanged since no code has altered the value of `y` or `z`.
