Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` increased by `a`, `y1` is either 1 or the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, and `c` is `m - y2`.

In the else block, the condition `(b // 2 > a and abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c and (1 <= y1 <= m) and (1 <= x1 <= n))` is false. Therefore, the postcondition includes the negation of this condition:

- `b // 2 <= a`
- `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`
- `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`
- `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`
