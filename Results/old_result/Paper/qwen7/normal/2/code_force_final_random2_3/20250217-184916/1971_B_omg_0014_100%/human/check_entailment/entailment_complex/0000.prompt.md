Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `t` remaining an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` being the original input integer greater than 0, and `i` being the last iteration index (n-1). For each iteration `i` from 0 to n-1, there is a corresponding input string `s_i`, a set `a_i` containing unique characters from `s_i`, and two strings `b_i` and `c_i` where `b_i` is the sorted version of `s_i` and `c_i` is the sorted version of `s_i` in descending order. If the size of `a_i` is 1, then `c_i` remains unchanged; otherwise, `c_i` is the sorted version of `s_i` in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the input string `s` contains more than one unique character. If `s` consists of a single unique character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then outputs either the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` or the lexicographically largest permutation of `s`, depending on which permutation matches the original string `s`.
