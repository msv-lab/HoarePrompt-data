Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of input strings, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers popped from the `numbers` list until it became empty.**

Explanation: The code `numbers = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. The previous values of `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, and `numbers` are unchanged. The `numbers` list now contains the split input strings, and `suma` remains as the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers popped from the `numbers` list until it became empty, which hasn't been modified yet.
