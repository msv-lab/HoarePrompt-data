Output State: **`a` must have at least one element; `cnt[x]` is equal to its previous value plus 2**

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[x]` by 1. Since `cnt[x]` was previously equal to its previous value plus 1, after executing the code, `cnt[x]` will be equal to its previous value plus 2. The precondition that `a` must have at least one element remains unchanged.
