Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second element is the new input integer, and the third element is the new input integer; `n` is the new input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the new input integer to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains two elements: the first element is the initial input integer (which is `t`), and the second element is the new input integer. After executing the code, `a` now has three elements: the first element remains the initial input integer, the second element is the new input integer, and the third element is also the new input integer. The value of `n` is the new input integer.
