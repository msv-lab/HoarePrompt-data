Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(2)`. This means `j` will take values from 0 to 1 inclusive.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is given as follows:
   - `lex` is an integer.
   - `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26.
   - If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains 1.
   - If `lex` is between 2 and 26 (excluding 27 and including 26), `arr` contains 26.
   - If `lex` is 27 or greater, `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` contains 26.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range `range(2)`, meaning it will run twice with `j` taking the values 0 and 1.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs twice, and we are currently at the end of the previous iteration, we need to consider the state at the start of the next iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be 1 (since it started at 0 and now needs to go to 1).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`, but since we are looking at the state before the next iteration starts, we need to ensure that `j` is set to 1.
   - The other variables (`lex` and `arr`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are specified that would alter these variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains 1. If `lex` is between 2 and 26 (excluding 27 and including 26), `arr` contains 26. If `lex` is 27 or greater, `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` contains 26. `j` is 1.**
