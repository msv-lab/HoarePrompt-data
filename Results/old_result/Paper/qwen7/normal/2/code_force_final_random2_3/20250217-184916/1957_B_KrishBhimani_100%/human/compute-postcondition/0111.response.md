Output State: All test cases have been processed. For each test case, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`. If `n` equals 1, the function prints `k` and does not modify any additional variables. Otherwise, `i` is the number of times `temp * 2` was less than `k` (where `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`); `arr` remains an empty list; `k0` is still equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, followed by `[0] * (n - len(ans))` to ensure its length matches `n`. The loop has processed all inputs, and the final output consists of the `ans` lists for each test case printed in sequence.
