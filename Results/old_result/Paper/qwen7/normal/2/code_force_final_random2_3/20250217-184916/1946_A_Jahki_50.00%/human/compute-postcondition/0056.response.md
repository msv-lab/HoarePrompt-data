Output State: **`b` is sorted, `ma` index of `b` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b`. The other variables `ma` and `op` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `b[ma]` is incremented by 1 because it was already incremented before sorting, and `op` is increased by 1 as per the initial state.
