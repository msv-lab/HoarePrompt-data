You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of river cells in a single row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list `row` is a list of non-negative integers where each element from index 0 up to index `d-2` has been incremented by 1, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports, and `i` is equal to `d-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, every element in the `row` list from the start up to the second last element will have been incremented by 1, depending on the value of `d`. The variable `d` remains unchanged, and `i` will be set to `d-1` after the last iteration.
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `len(row)`, `d` will remain as the initial positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports, and each element in the `row` list from index 0 up to index `d-2` will have been incremented by 1. The elements from index `d-1` to the end of the list will retain their original values unless they were updated during the loop's execution.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which is either incremented by 1 for indices from 0 to d-2 during the loop, or retains its original value otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d`. It increments the elements at indices from 0 to `d-2` by 1 and keeps the rest unchanged. The function returns the last element of the modified list `row`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which is either incremented by 1 for indices from 0 to d-2 during the loop, or retains its original value otherwise.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
