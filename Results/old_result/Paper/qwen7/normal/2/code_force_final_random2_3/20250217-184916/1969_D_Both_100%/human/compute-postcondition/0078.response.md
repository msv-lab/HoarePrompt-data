Output State: **`combined` is empty, `heap` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, and `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.**

Explanation: The code initializes `heap` as an empty list. This changes the state of `heap` to an empty list. All other variables remain in their initial states as specified in the initial conditions.
