Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `ac` and `bc` are integers. If the next character `i` is 'A', then `ac` is either 3 (if the previous character was 'A') or 2 (if the previous character was not 'A'), and `bc` is 1 (if the previous character was 'A') or 2 (if the previous character was not 'A'). If the next character `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is 1 (if the previous character was 'A') or 2 (if the previous character was not 'A'), and `bc` is either 3 (if the previous character was 'A') or 2 (if the previous character was not 'A').
