Postcondition: **`no` is a list containing either 'a' or an empty list, `big` is either a list containing `a` or an empty list, `less` is either a list containing `a` or an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is the first integer input from the split, `a` is the second integer input from the split.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if and else parts. If `x == 1`, then `big` becomes a list containing `a`. Otherwise, `big` remains an empty list while `less` can either contain `a` or remain empty.
