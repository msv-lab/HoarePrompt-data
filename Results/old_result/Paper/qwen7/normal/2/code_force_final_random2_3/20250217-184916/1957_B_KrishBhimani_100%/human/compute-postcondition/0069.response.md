Output State: The loop will eventually terminate when `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`. After all iterations, `i` will be the number of times the loop executed, which is determined by how many times `temp` can be doubled before it is no longer less than `k`. `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, and `temp` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically:

- `i` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed.
- `l1` will be a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
- `n` will be an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`.
- `k` will be an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`.
- `arr` will remain an empty list.
- `k0` will be equal to `k`.
- `ans` will remain an empty list.
- `temp` will be the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

This means that `temp` will be the highest power of 2 that does not exceed `k`, and `i` will represent the number of doublings required to reach or exceed `k`.
