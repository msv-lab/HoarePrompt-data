Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `s` is the new string input by the user, `pans` is a list with the value of `i` appended, and the standard output buffer is flushed.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. The value of `i` is `i_prev + 2` from the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged, and the standard output buffer is flushed as mentioned in the initial state.
