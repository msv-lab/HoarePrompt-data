Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `sum1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
