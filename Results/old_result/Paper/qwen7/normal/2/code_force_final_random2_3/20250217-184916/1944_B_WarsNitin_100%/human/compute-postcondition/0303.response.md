Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `k` is 0; `ans1` has the element `b[3]` and `b[3]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[3]` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is 3, the element `b[3]` is appended to `ans1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and the initial condition about `ans1` are updated accordingly.
