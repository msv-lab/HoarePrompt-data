Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **mak** is 2.
2. **i** is 3.
3. **pans** is a list containing the integers from 0 to \(n-1\) inclusive.
4. **mak2** is \(n-1\).
5. The current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (either '<' or '=' for the next iteration).
6. `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called 2*n-1 times.
7. The condition `s == '>'` is false based on the input received during the last iteration.

Given these details, let's focus on the print statement:

```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

- `pans[mak]` refers to the element at index 2 in the list `pans`. Since `pans` contains integers from 0 to \(n-1\), `pans[mak]` is the third element in the list, which is 2.
- `pans[i]` refers to the element at index 3 in the list `pans`. Since `pans` contains integers from 0 to \(n-1\), `pans[i]` is the fourth element in the list, which is 3.

Therefore, the print statement will output:

Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
