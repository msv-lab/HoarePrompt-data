Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now equal to `i`, and `i` must be less than `len(permutation)`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v`.**

In this step, the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is still equal to `i`, and `i` must still be less than `len(permutation)`.
