Output State: `costs` is a list containing the element 1, `h` is the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`, and `n` is reduced to 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will be reduced to 0 because it keeps being decreased by `i * curr` in each iteration until `n` reaches 0. The variable `h` accumulates the value of `curr` (which is `n // i`) for each element `i` in `costs`. Since `costs` contains `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` will be the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`. As `n` becomes 0, the loop terminates, and `h` holds the total sum of these divisions.
