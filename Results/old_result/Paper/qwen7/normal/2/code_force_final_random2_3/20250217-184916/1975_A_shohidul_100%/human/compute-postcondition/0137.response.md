Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `new` is an empty list, `check_all_new` is True, and `new_all` is True. If `check_all` is True, then the postcondition remains as initially described. Otherwise, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, `new` will be an empty list [], `check_all_new` will be False, and `new_all` will be False.
