Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `hmp`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each key `i` in the dictionary `hmp`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 'A'
   - `hmp` is {'A': 'B', 'B': 'C', 'C': 'D', 'D': 'E', 'E': 'F', 'F': 'G'}
   - `ans` is set to `m - hmp['A']` if `hmp[i] < m`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` is currently 'A', the next value of `i` will be the next key in the dictionary `hmp`. Given the current state, the next key is 'B'.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be updated to 'B'.
   - `hmp` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ans` is not directly dependent on the loop variable `i`, so its value does not change based on the loop iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 'B', `hmp` is {'A': 'B', 'B': 'C', 'C': 'D', 'D': 'E', 'E': 'F', 'F': 'G'}`**
