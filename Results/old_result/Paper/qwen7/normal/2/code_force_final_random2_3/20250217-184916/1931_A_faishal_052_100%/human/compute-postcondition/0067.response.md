Output State: **`lex` is an integer with a value greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26; `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

Explanation: The initial state of `lex` is an integer with a value greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52. After executing `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` is reduced by 26. The smallest possible value for `lex` initially is 28, so after subtracting 26, `lex` becomes at least 2. The largest possible value for `lex` initially is 51, so after subtracting 26, `lex` becomes less than 26. Therefore, `lex` is now an integer with a value greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26. The value of `arr` remains unchanged.
