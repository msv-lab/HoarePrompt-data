Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `l` is either 1 or remains as it was; `r` is either n - 2 or remains as it was; `sumk` is 0; `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r] - 2 * a[l]`; the current value of `a[l]` is decreased by the current value of `a[r]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to twice the current value of `a[r]`.**

In this output state, the variable `a[l]` is decreased by the value of `a[r]`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or remain unchanged. The value of `k` is now `k - 2 * a[r] - 2 * a[l]` because it was initially `k - 2 * a[r]` and then `a[l]` was decreased by `a[r]`.
