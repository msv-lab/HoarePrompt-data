Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to help Kirill minimize the cost of bribing people to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
   - The cost to move from position `j` to position `i` (where `j < i`) involves paying `a_j` coins to the person at position `j` and `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and `i`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The goal is to find the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions.
   - The strategy involves calculating the cost of moving Kirill from his current position to the desired positions and choosing the minimum cost.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which represent the costs `a_i` and `b_i` respectively.
   - The lists are reversed, which is unnecessary since the original order is used in the logic.
   - A variable `soma_b` is initialized to 0, and another variable `pref` is used to store the prefix sum of `b_i` values.
   - A loop iterates from `0` to `n-k-1`:
     - If `a_i < b_i`, it updates `pref` with `soma_b` and adds `a_i` to `pref`, setting `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `b_i` to `soma_b`.
   - Another loop from `n-k` to `n-1` calculates the minimum cost to move to the first `m` positions.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost.

4. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Check

1. **Logic of `func_1`:**
   - The logic seems to be flawed because it reverses the lists unnecessarily and does not correctly handle the cumulative cost calculation.
   - The main issue is in the logic where it tries to calculate the minimum cost by considering only the suffix sums of `b_i` values, which is not optimal.

2. **Optimal Solution:**
   - The optimal solution would involve maintaining a running sum of `b_i` values and using a priority queue or a similar structure to keep track of the minimum cost to move to each position.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
