Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It first checks if `s` is equal to 'mapie'. If true, it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from `s` and increments a counter `ans` by 1 for each removal. Then, it removes all occurrences of the substring 'pie' from `s` and increments `ans` by 1 for each removal. Finally, it returns the value of `ans`. If `s` initially does not contain 'pi', the function returns 1. If `s` contains 'pi', the function returns 6 and ensures that `s` no longer contains 'pi'.**
