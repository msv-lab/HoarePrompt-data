Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. Since the exact values of `mini`, `pk`, and `ele` are not specified, we can only state that `mini` is now the smaller of its original value and `abs(pk - ele)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
