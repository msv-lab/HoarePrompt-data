Based on the initial state provided:

- `v2` is equal to `i`
- `r` is the string input by the user

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

However, there is no definition for `v1` in the initial state. Since `v1` is not defined, it will remain as `v1` in the print statement.

Given the values:
- `v2` is equal to `i`
- `r` is the string input by the user but it is not used in the print statement

The print statement will output:
Output: **'? v1 v1 i i'**
