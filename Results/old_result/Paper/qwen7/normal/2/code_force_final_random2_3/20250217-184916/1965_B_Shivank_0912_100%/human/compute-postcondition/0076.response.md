Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 20.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 19
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0
   - `ans` contains the value 524288 (which is \(1 << 19\))

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 19, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 20.
   - The condition `n >= 0` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `n`.
   - The value of `ans` is derived from `j` through the expression `1 << j`. Since `j` will now be 20, `ans` will be \(1 << 20\), which is 1048576.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 20, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` contains the value 1048576 (which is 1 << 20)**
