Output State: **`i` is `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums, `totalOne` is the length of `preOne`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is the length of `preOne`, `zr` is the length of `suffZero` minus 1, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. `i` remains either `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `preOne` remains a list of cumulative sums, `totalOne` remains the length of `preOne`, `suffZero` remains a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on `el`, `el` remains `s1[i]`, `ans` remains a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` remains the length of `preOne`, `zr` remains the length of `suffZero` minus 1, and `zeroInd` remains `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` remains the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.
