Output State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(a)`, `sm` is the sum of all elements from index `0` to the end of the list `a`, and `cts` is a list containing all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` remains as `len(a) - 1` because the loop starts with `j` from `i` to `len(a) - 1` and increments `i` at the start of each iteration. The variable `j` will be `len(a)` because the loop condition `j < len(a)` ensures that `j` will increment until it is no longer less than `len(a)`. The variable `sm` will hold the sum of all elements from index `0` to the end of the list `a` because it starts adding elements from `a[j]` in each iteration, and `j` will eventually cover all indices from `0` to `len(a) - 1`. The list `cts` will contain all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`, meaning it will have `len(a)` elements, each representing the sum starting from that index to the end of the list `a`.
