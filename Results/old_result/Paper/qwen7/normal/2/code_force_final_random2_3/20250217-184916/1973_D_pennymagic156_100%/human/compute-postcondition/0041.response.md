Output State: `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2()` plus 3.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`. After each iteration, `cnt` is decremented by 1 and `l` is set to `func_2() + 1`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `cnt` would now be `k - 3` (since it started as `k`). Since `l` increases by `func_2() + 1` each time the loop runs, after 3 iterations, `l` would be `func_2() + 3`. Therefore, `cnt` is `cnt - 3` (or `k - 3`) and `l` is `func_2() + 3`. Assuming `cnt` reaches 0 after these iterations, the final state is `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2()` plus 3.
