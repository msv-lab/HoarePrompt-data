Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `p1` and `p2` will either both be 0 (if no matches were found that satisfied the conditions in the loop), or one of them will be 1 (if a match was found and the corresponding index was updated). The value of `idx1` will be updated to the index where the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` was last satisfied, and `idx2` is now `n - 2`. If no such indices were found, `idx1` and `idx2` will remain -1. `val` is an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is less than `idx2`; `l` is now equal to `l2`, and `idx2` is updated to `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` simply assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. No other changes occur to the variables `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, or `val`. The value of `idx2` is explicitly set to `n - 2` in the initial state description, so it remains unchanged.
