Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]`, `el` equals '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and the condition `ol <= zr` is true.
