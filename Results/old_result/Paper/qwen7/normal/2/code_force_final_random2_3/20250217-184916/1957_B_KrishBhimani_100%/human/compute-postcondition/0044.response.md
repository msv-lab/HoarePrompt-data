Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `arr`. This does not affect the values of `l1`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, they retain their initial states.
