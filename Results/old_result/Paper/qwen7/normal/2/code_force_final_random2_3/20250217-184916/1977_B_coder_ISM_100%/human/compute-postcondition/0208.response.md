Output State: **`i` is 28, `length` is exactly 29, `s` is an empty list, `flag` is 1, `nalla` is `t-1`, `x` is an input integer.**

The code `s = []` initializes `s` as an empty list, which replaces the previous string `s` with the new list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
