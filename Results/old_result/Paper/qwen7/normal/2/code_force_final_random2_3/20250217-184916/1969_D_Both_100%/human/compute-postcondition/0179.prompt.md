Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, `removed_item` will be True for each iteration where the operation `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` was executed, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 if it was initially greater than 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list; `prices` is updated to a list of negative values of the original `prices`, `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` must be greater than 0, and `heap` now contains the value of `combined.pop()`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` must be greater than 0, and `heap` now contains either two elements (the original heap value and the new value from `combined.pop()`), or it remains unchanged if `combined` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` must be greater than 1; `heap` now contains either three elements (the original two elements plus the new element from `combined.pop()`) or it remains unchanged if `combined` is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
