State: **`val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` must be between 0 and `n-1` inclusive**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is the only object in the loop head that needs to be adjusted.
- The loop `for i in range(n - 1):` will iterate from `0` to `n-2`.
- Therefore, `i` must be within the range `[0, n-1]` for the loop to execute at least once.

Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1, the condition `i < n - 1` must hold true for the loop to execute. Hence, `i` must be between `0` and `n-1` inclusive.
