Reasoning:
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` is the main function that processes multiple test cases. It reads input from standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.
- `func_1` is designed to handle a string composed of characters '@' and '*', but the problem description does not mention any such strings or characters. Instead, the problem involves periodicities of signs and their occurrence years.
- The logic in `func_1` does not match the requirements of the problem. It seems to be solving a different problem related to paths or sequences of characters, not the periodic occurrences of signs.
- The problem requires finding the year when all signs occur sequentially based on their periodicities. This would involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities, but the provided code does not perform this calculation.
- Therefore, the given code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
