Output State: **`results` contains the value of `beautiful_count`, which is the total count of pairs \((mod_x, mod_y)\) found in the frequency dictionary `freq`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(beautiful_count)` appends the current value of `beautiful_count` to the list `results`. This means that `results` now includes the total count of pairs \((mod_x, mod_y)\) that were found in the frequency dictionary `freq` after all iterations of the loop have finished. The values of `beautiful_count`, `freq`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y` remain unchanged from their previous states.
