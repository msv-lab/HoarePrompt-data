Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in results`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `results`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list. The variable `i` is used to iterate over each element in the `results` list.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the current element being processed in the `results` list.
   - `results` is the list from which `i` is being iterated.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the current element being processed, it will move to the next element in the list for the next iteration.
   - The `results` list remains the same unless modified outside the loop.

Given that `i` is the current element and `results` is the list from which `i` is being iterated, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next element in the list, and `results` should still be the same list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is the next element in the `results` list, `results` is the same list**
