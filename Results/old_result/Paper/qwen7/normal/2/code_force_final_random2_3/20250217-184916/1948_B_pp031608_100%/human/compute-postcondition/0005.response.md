Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `m`, and the range function parameters.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `m-1` to `1` (inclusive) in reverse order. This means `i` will take values from `m-1` down to `1`.

3. **Determine necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the initial value of `i` should be `m-1`, and `m` should be greater than 1 because the loop starts from `m-1` and goes down to `1`.

4. **Consider other variables**: The variable `ans` and the list `arr` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `i` must start at `m-1`.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment is:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `i` is `m-1`**.
