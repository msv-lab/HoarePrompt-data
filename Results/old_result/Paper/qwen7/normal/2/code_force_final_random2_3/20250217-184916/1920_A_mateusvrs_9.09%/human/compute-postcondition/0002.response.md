Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is a placeholder for the loop index, and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `t` is given to be an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

4. **Consider the other variables**: The variables `n` and `r` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `r` is an empty list**
