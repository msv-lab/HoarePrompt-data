Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the current implementation simply counts how many elements in the array are equal to the median (the element at the middle index after sorting). This does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the median element based on the formula \( p = \lceil \frac{n+1}{2} \rceil - 1 \).
3. Count how many elements are less than or equal to the median.
4. Calculate the difference between the median and the next greater element (if available), and sum these differences to get the minimum number of operations required to make the median strictly greater than its current value.

The current implementation only counts the occurrences of the median, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

Correctness: **False**
