Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, and we are about to read the next line of input which will contain a list of `n` integers.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the next line of input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an input integer. We are also instructed that we are about to read the next line of input which will contain an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, and `_` must be set to an iterator that will range from 0 to `t-1`.
