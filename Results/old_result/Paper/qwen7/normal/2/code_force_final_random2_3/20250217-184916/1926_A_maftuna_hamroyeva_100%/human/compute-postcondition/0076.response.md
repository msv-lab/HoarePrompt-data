Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body Effects**: From the postcondition, we know that:
   - `j` is a string.
   - `l` is incremented by 1 if `j` is 'A'.
   - `h` is incremented by 1 regardless of whether `j` is 'A' or not.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is a string.
   - `l` is incremented by 1 if `j` is 'A'.
   - `h` is incremented by 1 regardless of whether `j` is 'A' or not.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is a string, it remains a string in the next iteration.
   - `l` will be incremented by 1 if `j` is 'A' in the next iteration.
   - `h` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration regardless of the value of `j`.

Given these points, we need to update the state for the next iteration of the loop.

**State: **`j` is a string, `l` is incremented by 1 if `j` is 'A' in the next iteration, and `h` is incremented by 1 in the next iteration**.
