Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with its length greater than 3, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 1, the current value of `s[j]` is '1', and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1'.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` changes from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
