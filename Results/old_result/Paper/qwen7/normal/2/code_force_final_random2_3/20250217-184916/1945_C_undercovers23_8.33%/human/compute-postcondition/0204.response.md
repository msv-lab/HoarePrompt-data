Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is `n // 2`
   - `zero` is 1
   - `one` is 1
   - `zero_perc` is 50.0
   - `one_perc` is 100
   - `lst` contains `[2]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2 (as the loop iterates from 0 to `n-2`).
   - The value of `n` remains `n // 2` as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - The values of `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged because they are not modified in the loop body either.
   - The list `lst` is not relevant to the loop condition and remains as `[2]`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains `n // 2`.
   - `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged.
   - `lst` remains `[2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `n // 2`, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50.0, `one_perc` is 100, and `lst` contains `[2]`**.
