Output State: **`L` is `x`, `R` is the right boundary, `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `L` is updated to the value of `x`, which is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. The other variables (`R`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
