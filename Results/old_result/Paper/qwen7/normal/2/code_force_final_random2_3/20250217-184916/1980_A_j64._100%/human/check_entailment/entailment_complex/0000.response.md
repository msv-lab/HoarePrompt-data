Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of problems (`n`) and the number of rounds (`m`), and then reads the string of problem difficulties (`a`).
3. The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.
4. In `func_1`, the program correctly counts the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the input string `a`.
5. The logic to calculate the minimum number of additional problems required is correct. It checks how many of each difficulty level are missing to meet the requirement of `m` rounds and sums these up.
6. The function returns the correct value, which is the minimum number of additional problems needed.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
