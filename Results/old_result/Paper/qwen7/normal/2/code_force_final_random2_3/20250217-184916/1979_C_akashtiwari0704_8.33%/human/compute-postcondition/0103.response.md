Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is `bets`, where `bets` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is `0`.
- `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets-1`.
- `sumo` is the cumulative sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.
- Each element `a[i]` in the list is updated to the value of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.

The `print(-1)` statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
