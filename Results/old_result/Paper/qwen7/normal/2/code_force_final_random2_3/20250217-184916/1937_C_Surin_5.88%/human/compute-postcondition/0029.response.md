Output State: `n` must be greater than the total number of iterations (which is `n-1`), `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`. If `r` equals '<' for each iteration from 1 to `n-1`, then the values of `v1` and `v2` will be equal to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and `v2` will also be equal to `n-1`. The value of `v1` will be the same as `v2` if the user inputs '<' for each iteration. The variable `n` must initially be greater than the number of iterations to allow the loop to run completely.
