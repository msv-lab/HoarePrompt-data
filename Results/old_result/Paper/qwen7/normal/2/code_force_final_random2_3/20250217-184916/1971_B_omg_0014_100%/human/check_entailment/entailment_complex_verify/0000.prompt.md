You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `t` remaining an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` being the original input integer greater than 0, and `i` being the last iteration index (n-1). For each iteration `i` from 0 to n-1, there is a corresponding input string `s_i`, a set `a_i` containing unique characters from `s_i`, and two strings `b_i` and `c_i` where `b_i` is the sorted version of `s_i` and `c_i` is the sorted version of `s_i` in descending order. If the size of `a_i` is 1, then `c_i` remains unchanged; otherwise, `c_i` is the sorted version of `s_i` in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the input string `s` contains more than one unique character. If `s` consists of a single unique character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then outputs either the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` or the lexicographically largest permutation of `s`, depending on which permutation matches the original string `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to generate a valid rearrangement `r` that is different from the input string `s` in some cases. Specifically, the program checks if all characters in the string are the same by converting the string to a set and checking its length. If the length is 1, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by either the reverse sorted string or the sorted string of the input.

However, this approach does not guarantee that the generated string `r` is different from `s`. For example, consider the input "co". The program would correctly identify that it cannot produce a different string and print "NO". But for inputs like "aa", the program would incorrectly print "YES" followed by "aa" because the sorted and reversed versions are the same.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the generated string `r` is different from `s`. One way to do this is to check if the sorted string is the same as the original string and handle such cases separately. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            sorted_s = ''.join(sorted(s))
            if sorted_s == s:
                # Generate a different string
                r = s[1:] + s[0]
                print('YES', r)
            else:
                print('YES', sorted_s[::-1])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the generated string `r` is different from `s` by swapping the first character with the rest of the string if the sorted string is the same as the original string.
