Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The interactor chooses a fixed permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} which is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mak` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `len(pans) - 1` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, `mak2` is `n-1`, the current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (it could be either '<' or '=' for the next iteration), `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `2*n-1` times, and the condition `s == '>'` is false based on the input received during the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: mak is n+1, n is greater than 0, i is n, pans is a list containing all the values of i from 0 to n-1 inclusive, and len(pans) must be n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
