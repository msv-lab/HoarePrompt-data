Output State: **The list `ans` will contain all integers from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, except for `1 << i`. The variable `j` will be 19 after the loop completes, `i` will remain as 20, `tc` will still be `t`, `n` will remain unchanged as the input integer, and `k` will still be 1048576.**

In more detail, after the loop completes all 20 iterations (since `range(20)` generates numbers from 0 to 19), the list `ans` will include all powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{19}\), excluding \(2^i\) where `i` is 20. This means `ans` will contain the values \([1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 524288]\) but not \(1048576\). The variable `j` will take its final value as 19, and the other variables (`i`, `tc`, `n`, and `k`) will retain their initial values.
