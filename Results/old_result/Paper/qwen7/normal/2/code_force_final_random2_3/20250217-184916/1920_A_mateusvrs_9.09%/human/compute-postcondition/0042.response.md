Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in cx:`. The only variable here is `i`, which is being iterated over the set `cx`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is being iterated over the set `cx`, `i` must be one of the elements in `cx`. However, we don't know the exact value of `i` initially, but we do know that `i` will take on each value in `cx` during the loop iterations.

3. **Adjust the states of objects in the loop head**:
   - `i`: We need to ensure that `i` is one of the elements in `cx`.
   - `cx`: We need to ensure that `cx` is a non-empty set because if `cx` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Other variables**: The other variables (`tmp`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, `x`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `cx` must be a non-empty set.
- `i` must be an element of `cx`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`cx` is a non-empty set, `i` is an element of `cx`**
