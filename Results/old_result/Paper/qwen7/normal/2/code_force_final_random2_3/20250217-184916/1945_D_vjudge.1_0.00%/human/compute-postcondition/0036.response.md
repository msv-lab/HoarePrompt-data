Output State: **`i` is `n - k`; `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]`; `resultado` is updated to be the minimum between `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `soma_b` by adding `lista_B[i]` to its current value. It also updates `resultado` to be the minimum value between its current value and the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `pref`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B` remain unchanged from their initial state.
