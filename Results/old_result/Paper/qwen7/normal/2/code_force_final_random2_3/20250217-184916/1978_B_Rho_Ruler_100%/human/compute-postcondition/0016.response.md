Output State: **`low`, `high`, `mid` are as follows: `mid` is set to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `high` must be at least `mid + 1` to ensure `low <= high`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged.**

This means that the `mid` variable is now updated to the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The condition that `high` must be at least `mid + 1` to ensure `low <= high` remains valid. The values of `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` have not been altered by this operation.
