Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9.
- `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9.
- `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9.
- `res` is either 'peak' if `y` is greater than `z`, or 'none'.

The `print(x, y, z, sep=' ')` statement will print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by a space. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9, their specific values cannot be determined without running the code. However, they will be printed in this format.

Output: **[x] [y] [z]** (where [x], [y], and [z] are random integers between 1 and 9)
