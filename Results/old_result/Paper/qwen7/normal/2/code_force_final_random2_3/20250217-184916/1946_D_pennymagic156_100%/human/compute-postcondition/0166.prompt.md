Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 27, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with `val`. If `op` is False, then `a` remains unchanged and `t` is a list containing one element which is the same as `ai` and `ai` is 0. Since there is no else part, the list `a` and the list `t` remain as described above.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with the next `val`, and `val` is the next element from `a`; `ai` is updated to be the current `ai` XORed with the next `val`, and `t` is a list containing one additional element which is the updated `ai`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with the next `val`, and `val` is the next element from `a`; `ai` is updated to be the current `ai` XORed with the next `val` and then XORed with `op` right-shifted by `i` and ANDed with 1; `t` is a list containing one additional element which is the updated `ai`; if `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
