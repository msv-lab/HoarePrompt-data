Output State: The list `a` will contain the initial element 1000 followed by `n-1` elements, each calculated as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and `n` will remain unchanged from its initial state.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have `n` elements where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is derived by subtracting the corresponding element from the list `T` (starting from index 0) from the previous element in `a`. The variable `i` will be set to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations, and `n` will retain its original value.
