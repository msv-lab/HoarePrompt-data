To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s2` is a string where the first character of `s` is moved to the end of `s2`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(s2)`

Given this, we need to understand how `s2` is constructed from `s`. Let's assume `s` is a string with characters `s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1]` where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

When the first character of `s` is moved to the end of `s2`, the resulting string `s2` would be:
- `s2 = s[1:n] + s[0]`

For example, if `s = "hello"`, then `s2` would be `"elloh"` because the first character `'h'` is moved to the end.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we can only describe `s2` in terms of `s`.

Output: **s[1:len(s)] + s[0]**
