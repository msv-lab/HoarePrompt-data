Output State: **`sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is an integer and equals `k - a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]` if `a[l]` was not 0, and `l` is increased by 1 if `a[l]` was equal to 0.**

This means that `sunks` has been incremented by 1. The value of `k` remains as `k - a[r] * 2`. The value of `a[l]` has been decreased by `a[r]` only if `a[l]` was not already 0. Additionally, if `a[l]` was 0, then `l` has been increased by 1. If `a[l]` was not 0, no changes were made to `a[l]` or `l`.
