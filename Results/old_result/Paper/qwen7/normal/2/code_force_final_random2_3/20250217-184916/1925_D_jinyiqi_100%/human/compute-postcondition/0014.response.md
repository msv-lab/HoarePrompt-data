Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the iterations, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration, `j` is the last index value of the range `m-1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `sum_f` will hold the cumulative sum of all `f` values entered as input for each iteration of the loop. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `f` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `a` and `b` will be the values entered for the last iteration, `f` will be the `f` value entered for the last iteration, and `j` will be the last index value of the range, which is `m-1`.
