Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers assigned by the input split and converted to integers. `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`; `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2.**

This means that the variable `x` is now assigned the value of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
