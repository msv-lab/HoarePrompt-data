You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
def func_5():
    n, k = func_3()
    v = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
        
        v = func_2()
        
        if v == n:
            v = i
            break
        
    #State: n is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), i is 1, and v is \(n - 3\).
    for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
        cnt, l = k, 1
        
        while cnt and l < n + 1:
            print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
            l = func_2() + 1
            cnt -= 1
        
        if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:
            print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
            func_2()
            return
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and the condition `(cnt == 0 and l == n + 1)` holds true.
    print('! -1', flush=True)
    #This is printed: ! -1
    func_2()
    return
    #The program does not return any value since there is no return statement with an expression.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns the value of `l`, which is `func_2() + 3` in Case_1. In other cases, it returns None or does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of `l`, which is `func_2() + 3`

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program returns None

Case_4: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement with an expression.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
