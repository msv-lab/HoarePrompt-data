Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`, where `val` is the next element in the list `a` and `i` is an unspecified integer, `cnt` is increased by 1.**

This means that the variable `cnt` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `a` and `op` remain unchanged from their initial state.
