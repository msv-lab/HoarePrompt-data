Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is at least 5, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`, `_` is 4, and a new string input is taken but its value is not assigned to any variable. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, then `t` remains a positive integer, `n` remains an integer input from the first split, `m` remains at least 5, `a1` remains the first integer from the input split, `a2` remains the second integer from the input split, `l22` remains a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` remains a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`, `_` remains 4, and a new string input is taken but its value is not assigned to any variable.**
