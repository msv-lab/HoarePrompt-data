Postcondition: **`i` is 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was 1), `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[i] != '0'` is met, `one_perc` is recalculated based on the new value of `one`, and if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]`.**
