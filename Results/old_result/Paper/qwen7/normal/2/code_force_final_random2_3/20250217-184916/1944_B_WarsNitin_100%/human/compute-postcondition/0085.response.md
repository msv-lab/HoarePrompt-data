Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and the list `ans2` now contains the elements `c[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `ans2` now includes the new element `c[i]` in addition to its previous contents.
