Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is `s * (l[i] + t)`
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`
   - `t` is `s`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c` is `s * (l[i] + t)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `s`, `i` is `i + 1`**
