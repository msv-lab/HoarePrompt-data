Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not `-1` and is either `n - 2` or another valid index, and `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits them into a list. The first element is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are assigned to the list `l3`. All other variables (`i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
