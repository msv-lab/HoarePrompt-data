Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes the input values of `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` for each test case, and returns None in most cases. In Case_4, it returns the absolute difference between the sixth and fourth elements of `r`. In Case_5 and Case_6, it returns the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, which is `t`. In Case_9, it does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.**
