Output State: **`i` is `n - k + 1`, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[n - k + 2]`, `pref` remains the same, `resultado` is updated to `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`**.

This means that the variable `resultado` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
