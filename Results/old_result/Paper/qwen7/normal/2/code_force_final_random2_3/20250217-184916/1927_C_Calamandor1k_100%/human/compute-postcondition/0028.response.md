Output State: **`unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list now contains 'YES'; `k` remains unchanged; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new set `relevant_a` which contains only those elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
