Output State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is equal to `m` plus the previous value of `ans`**.

In this case, the variable `ans` is being updated by adding the value of `m` to it. However, since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, we can only say that `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus `m`. The variables `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
