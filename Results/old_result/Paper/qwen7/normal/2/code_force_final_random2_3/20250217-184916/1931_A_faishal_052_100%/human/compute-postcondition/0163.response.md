Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `cases`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` set to 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 3. Therefore, `j` must be able to increment from 0 to 2 within the loop.

4. **Adjust the state of `cases`**: Since the value of `cases` does not directly affect the loop's execution (the loop runs regardless of the value of `cases`), it does not need to be adjusted.

5. **Adjust the state of `temp`**: The variable `temp` is an empty string and does not affect the loop's execution either.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment is `j`, which should be initialized to 0 as specified, but no further adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `temp` is an empty string, `j` is 0**
