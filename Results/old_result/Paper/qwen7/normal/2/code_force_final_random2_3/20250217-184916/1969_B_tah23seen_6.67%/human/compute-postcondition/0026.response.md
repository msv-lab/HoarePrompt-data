Output State: **`left` is 2, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - left + 1`, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and the length of `s` must be at least 2, and `s[1]` must not be '1' and no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0'**.

Explanation: The variable `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
