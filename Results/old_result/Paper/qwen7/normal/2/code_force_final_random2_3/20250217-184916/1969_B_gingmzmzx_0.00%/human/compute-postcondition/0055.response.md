Postcondition: `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers with at least one element (after removing the first element). If `c` is 0, `ans` is equal to `ans + 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0`. Otherwise, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, where `zeroes` is the total number of zeros in the original list `s`. `c` is the first element of the updated `s`.
