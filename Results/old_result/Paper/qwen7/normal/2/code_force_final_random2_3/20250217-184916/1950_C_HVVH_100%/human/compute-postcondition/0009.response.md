Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an input integer greater than 12 minus 12, `m` is an input integer, and `h` is not equal to 0**.

This means that `h` is now `h - 12`, which is an integer greater than 0 since `h` was originally an integer greater than 12. All other variables remain unchanged.
