Output State: **`k` is 499, `n` is 500, `h` is 499, `li` is a sorted list of 500,000 elements.**

Explanation: The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `li`. However, since `li` was already sorted initially, sorting it again does not change its state. All other variables (`k`, `n`, and `h`) remain unchanged.
