Output State: **`cnt` is a list of length `n`, `ans` is `ans + max(0, x - 1)` where `x` is the last element of `cnt` in the current iteration.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `max(0, x - 1)` where `x` is the last element of the list `cnt`. Since the length of `cnt` is `n`, the last element `x` is the nth element of the list. The value of `ans` is updated based on the last element of `cnt` in the current iteration, and the length of `cnt` remains `n`.
