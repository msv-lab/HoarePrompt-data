Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is the number of children (an input integer).
- `m` is the number of pairs of friends (an input integer).
- `k` is the number of excursions (an input integer).
- `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (an input list of lists).
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(result)
```

Given the above information, the `print(result)` statement will print the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the output of `func_1` with the given parameters.

Output: **result (the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
