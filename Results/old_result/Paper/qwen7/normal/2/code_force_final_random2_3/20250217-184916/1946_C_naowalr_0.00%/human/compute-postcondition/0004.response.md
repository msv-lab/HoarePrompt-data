Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n - 1):` will iterate from `0` to `n-2`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `1`. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to `2`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to `2` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `i` will start from `0` in the first iteration.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The variable `k` and the list `adj` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0**
