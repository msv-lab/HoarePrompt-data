Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `s` is a string input from the user. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` remains unchanged and `b` remains 'SQUARE'.
