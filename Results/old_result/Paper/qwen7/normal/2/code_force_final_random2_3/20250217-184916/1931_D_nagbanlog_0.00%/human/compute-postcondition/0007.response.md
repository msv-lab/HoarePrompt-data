Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in a:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num`: This variable will take on each value from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a`: This is the list from the first test case.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is derived from the first test case (`test_cases[0]['params']`), we need to ensure that `a` is not empty for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `beautiful_count` and `results` are not directly related to the loop execution and do not need adjustment.
   - `test_cases` is a non-empty list, so the first test case exists.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are specific to the first sublist of the first test case and are not needed for the loop to execute.
   - `freq` is an empty dictionary and does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `a` to ensure it is not empty. 

**Final State**:
State: **`a` is not empty**
