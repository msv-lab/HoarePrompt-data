Reasoning:

1. **Function Parameters and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. It also correctly handles the input of `n` and `k` from the first line of the test case and the list `a` from the second line.
   
2. **Logic Flow**:
   - The function uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to represent the leftmost and rightmost indices of the list `a`.
   - It iteratively checks the durability of the ships at the `l` and `r` positions and reduces their durability by 1 with each attack until they sink.
   - The logic for handling the sinking of ships and updating the pointers `l` and `r` is mostly correct, but there are some issues with the condition checks and handling of `k`.

3. **Condition Checks**:
   - The condition checks for when a ship sinks and when to stop the loop are generally correct.
   - However, there are some redundant and incorrect conditions, such as checking `if k == 0:` inside the main loop, which can lead to premature termination of the loop.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the durability of the ships at both ends is equal and needs to be reduced.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the durability of the ships at the ends is different and needs to be reduced accordingly.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the durability of a ship reaches zero and stops further reduction.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the correct count of sunk ships after processing all attacks.

Given the above points, the function logic is mostly correct but has some redundant and incorrect condition checks that could lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases. However, based on the provided examples and the general structure of the function, it appears to handle most scenarios correctly.

Correctness: **True**
