Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, `balance` is either a positive or negative integer depending on whether there are more opening or closing parentheses in `s`, and `details` is a list containing as many tuples as there are characters in `s`. Each tuple in `details` has the form `(balance, -i, char)`, indicating the current balance of parentheses, the negative index of the current character, and the character itself from the original string `s`.

This means that after the loop completes, `balance` will reflect the net difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the string `s`. If `balance` is positive, there are more opening parentheses than closing ones; if it's negative, there are more closing parentheses. The `details` list captures the state of the balance at each step of the iteration, providing a detailed trace of how the balance changed with each character processed.
