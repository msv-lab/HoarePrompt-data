Output State: **`index` is 10, `t` is 0, `n` is data[9], `s` is a string of length data[9] containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list with 'YES' appended, `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`.**

The code `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
