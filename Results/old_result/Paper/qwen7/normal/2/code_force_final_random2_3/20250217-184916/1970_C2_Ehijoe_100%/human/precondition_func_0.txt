nodes is a dictionary where each key is a node (an integer between 1 and n) and the value is a list of integers representing its neighbors, excluding the parent node. start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and parent is an integer representing the parent node of the current node (used for recursion and not modified).
