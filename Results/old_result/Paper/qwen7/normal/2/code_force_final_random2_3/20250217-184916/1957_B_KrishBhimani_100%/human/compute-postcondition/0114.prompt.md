You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two positive integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed all iterations based on the input provided. For each test case, the variable `ans` will contain a list of integers where the first element is \((1 << i) - 1\), the second element is \(k - (1 << i) - 1\), and the rest of the elements are 0s to make the total length of the list equal to `n`. Here, `i` is determined as the number of times `temp * 2` is less than `k` before it is no longer true, with `temp` being the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. If `n` is 1, `ans` will simply be `[k]`.
    #
    #The state of other variables such as `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, and `temp` will be as described for the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `l1` will be the list of strings obtained from the last input, `n` and `k` will be the integers obtained from the last input, `k0` will be equal to `k`, `arr` will be an empty list, and `temp` will be the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` if `n` is not 1. If `n` is 1, these variables will retain their values from the last input without further changes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and k. For each test case, it checks if 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and if the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. It then returns a result based on the validation of these conditions.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
