Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary; `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`; `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to `0`; `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code sets `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` to `0`. This means that the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is now `0`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
