Output State: **`cnt` is `k` and `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is `func_2() + 2` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `l` was initially set to `func_2() + 3`. After executing the line `l = func_2() + 1`, the value of `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() + 2`. The initial conditions for `cnt` and the relationship between `l` and `n` remain unchanged.
