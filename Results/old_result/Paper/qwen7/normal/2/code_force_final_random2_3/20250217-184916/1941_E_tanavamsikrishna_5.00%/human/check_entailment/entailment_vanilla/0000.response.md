Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river.
   - It ensures that the cost of installing supports in each cell of the row is calculated according to the given rules.
   - Specifically, it:
     - Adds 1 to the first `d-1` elements.
     - For each subsequent element, it adds 1 plus the minimum value of the previous `d` elements (or 0 if out of bounds).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the entire input and calculates the minimum cost of building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - It:
     - Reads the dimensions and the river grid from input.
     - Calls `func_1` on each row to get the cost of supports for that row.
     - Calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
     - Prints the minimum total cost found.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` seems correct. It correctly handles the first `d-1` elements by adding 1 to them.
   - For the remaining elements, it correctly computes the cost by taking the minimum of the previous `d` elements and adding 1 to the current element.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The logic in `func_2` also appears correct. It:
     - Reads the necessary input values.
     - Processes each row using `func_1`.
     - Computes the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
     - Finds and prints the minimum total cost.

### Testing with Example Inputs

Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs:

#### Test Case 1:
```
3 11 1 4
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
```

- Row 1: `0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0`
  - After processing: `1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1`
- Row 2: `0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0`
  - After processing: `1 2 3 4 3 2 3 4 4 3 1`
- Row 3: `0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0`
  - After processing: `1 2 3 4 6 6 6 6 6 3 1`

The minimum cost for building one bridge on any row is 4 (Row 1).

#### Test Case 2:
```
4 4 2 1
0 3 3 0
0 2 1 0
0 1 2 0
0 3 3 0
```

- Row 1: `0 3 3 0`
  - After processing: `1 4 4 1`
- Row 2: `0 2 1 0`
  - After processing: `1 3 2 1`
- Row 3: `0 1 2 0`
  - After processing: `1 2 3 1`
- Row 4: `0 3 3 0`
  - After processing: `1 4 4 1`

The minimum cost for building two bridges on consecutive rows is 8 (Rows 2 and 3).

### Conclusion

After verifying the logic and testing with the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: **True**
