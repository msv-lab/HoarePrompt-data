Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 2 or 3, `one` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[i] != '0'` is met, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]` and `zero` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The variable `zero` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, and `n` is at least 2, the value of `zero` changes from either 1 or 2 to either 2 or 3.
- The conditions for `one`, `one_perc`, and `lst` remain unchanged because the code only increments `zero` and does not affect the other variables or conditions.
