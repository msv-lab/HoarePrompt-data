Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `k + 1`, `x` and `n` will remain unchanged, and `ans` will be a list of length `k + 1` containing the sequence of `sums` values calculated during each iteration of the loop.**

In more detail:
- `i` will be incremented to `k + 1` after the final iteration of the loop.
- `x` and `n` will retain their original values since they are not modified within the loop.
- `ans` will be a list of `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` will represent the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, starting from the initial computation when `i == 0` and updating according to the given conditions for subsequent iterations. The final element in `ans` will be the maximum value among all the computed sums, which is printed at the end of the loop.
