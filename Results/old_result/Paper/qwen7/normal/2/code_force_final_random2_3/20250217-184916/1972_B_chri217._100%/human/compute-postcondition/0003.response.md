Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `case`, which is a list of length 2. The first element of `case` is an integer representing the number of coins (n), and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down). The function returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the second element of `case` is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.**
