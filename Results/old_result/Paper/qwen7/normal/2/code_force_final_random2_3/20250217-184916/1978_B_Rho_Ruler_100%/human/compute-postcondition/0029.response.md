Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high` - 1; `mid` is updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2; `profit_mid` is the value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b); `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.**

Explanation: The code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new condition for `low` is that it is less than or equal to `high - 1`. The values of `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` remain as they were before the code was executed.
