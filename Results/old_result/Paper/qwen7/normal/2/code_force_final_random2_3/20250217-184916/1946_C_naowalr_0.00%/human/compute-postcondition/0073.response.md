Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is 50001, `adj` is a bidirectional adjacency list with `n` nodes, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` calls the function `dfs` with arguments `1` and `1`. The result of this function call is assigned to the variable `leftover`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `x`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
