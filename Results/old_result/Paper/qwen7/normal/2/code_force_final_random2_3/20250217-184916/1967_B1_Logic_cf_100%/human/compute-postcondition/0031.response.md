Output State: **`ans` is equal to `n`, `b` is \(\min(n, m) + 2\)**.

Explanation: The code `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. The values of `b` and the calculation involving `n` and `m` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `b` remains as \(\min(n, m) + 2\).
