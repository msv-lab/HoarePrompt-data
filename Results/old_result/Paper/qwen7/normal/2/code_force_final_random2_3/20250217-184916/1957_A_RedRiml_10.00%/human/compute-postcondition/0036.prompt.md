Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `palka` contains at least one element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`. After executing the if-else block, the condition `i not in pl` no longer holds true as `i` is now added to `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `palka` contains all elements except the first one, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, and if `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` now contains the element `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `palka` contains all elements except the first two, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, and if `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` now contains the element `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
