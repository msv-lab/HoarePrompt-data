Based on the initial state provided:

- `no`, `big`, and `less` lists will contain integers `a` based on certain conditions.
- `num` is initially set to 0 and is not modified within the loop.
- `innerLoop` retains its initial value, which is the number of times the loop was intended to run.
- After all iterations, `iterable2` equals `innerLoop - 1`, indicating the total number of times the loop body was executed.
- `num` is 0.
- The condition `num < 1` is true.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print(0)
```

This statement will directly print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
