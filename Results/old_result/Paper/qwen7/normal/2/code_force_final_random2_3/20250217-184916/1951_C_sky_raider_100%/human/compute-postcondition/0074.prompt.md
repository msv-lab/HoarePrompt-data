Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9); a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    t = 0
    s = 0
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        c += s * (l[i] + t)
        t += s
        k -= s
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `c` is the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `n * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `n * s`, `i` is `n`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `c` will hold the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and the remaining value of `k` after subtracting the total number of iterations times `s`. The variable `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `m` is reduced by the total amount of `s` used over all iterations, and `k` is reduced by the same amount. The variable `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at the start of each iteration. The variable `t` accumulates the value of `s` for each iteration, resulting in `n * s` by the end of the loop. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n` after all iterations have completed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all iterations, `c` is the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration, `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, `t` is `n * s`, `k` is decreased by `n * s`, and `i` is `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` will be `k - n * s`, `s` will be the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` will be the sum of `s` added `n` times, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `c` will be the sum of `c + s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will equal `n`, `k` will be reduced by `n * s`, `t` will be `n * s`, `c` will be the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration, and `s` will be the minimum of `m` and the remaining value of `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
