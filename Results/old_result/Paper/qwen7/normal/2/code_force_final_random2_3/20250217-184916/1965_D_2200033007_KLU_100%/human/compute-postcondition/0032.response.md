Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `odds`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is an integer representing the size of a palindrome array. The function returns an array 'a' populated based on the values in the 'odds' list. For each 'x' in 'odds', if 'idx' equals 'n - 1 - idx', the middle element of 'a' is updated to 'x'. Otherwise, the elements symmetrically positioned around the center of 'a' are updated to \((x - prev) // 2\), with 'prev' being the value of 'x' from the previous iteration. The 'prev' variable holds the last value of 'x' from the 'odds' list, and 'idx' is set to \(-1\).**
