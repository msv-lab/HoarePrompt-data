Postcondition: `i` is 1 or 2, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[i] != '0'` is met, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]`.
