Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is at least 5, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`, `_` is 4, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, and if `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then no changes are made to `n` and `i`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2 and `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then either `idx1` is set to `i + p1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, or `idx2` is set to `i + p2` if `l2[i + p2] == a1`. Additionally, if `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the if condition is not met, the postcondition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
