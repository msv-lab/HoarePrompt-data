Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n`, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is `t`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is adjusted based on the condition (either 2 times the original value of `k` or 2 times the original value minus 2), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the elements from index `n` to the end of `a`, `c` is sorted in ascending order, `req` is `k`, `l` is a list containing the element `b[0]` if `b[0] != b[1]`; otherwise, `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is equal to 0, and either `b[i]` is added to list `l` (if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`) or `ans1` contains the elements `b[i - 1]` and `b[1]` (if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` is 0. If `b[2]` is equal to `b[1]`, `ans1` contains the element `b[2]` appended to it. If `b[2]` is not equal to `b[3]`, the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `k` is either -2 or 0. If `b[3]` is equal to `b[4]`, then `ans1` contains the element `b[3]` and `b[3]` appended to it. If `b[3]` is not equal to `b[4]`, then the condition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
