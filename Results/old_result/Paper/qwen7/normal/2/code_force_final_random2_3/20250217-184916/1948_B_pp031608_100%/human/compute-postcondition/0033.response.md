Postcondition: `i` is `m-3`, `m` remains greater than 1, `arr[i-1]` is updated such that it either equals `nums[0]` where `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last character of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, or `arr[i-1]` remains unchanged, and `ans` is `False`.
