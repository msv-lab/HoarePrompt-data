Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `index` is 12, `t` is 0, `n` is `data[11]`, `s` is a string of length `data[11]` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list with either 'YES' or 'NO' appended for each iteration, and `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, 'YES' is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to `results`.

This means that after the loop completes, `index` will be 12 (since it increments by 2 for each iteration and there were 6 iterations), `t` will be 0 (as it starts at a positive value and is not modified within the loop), `n` will be the value at `data[11]`, `s` will be a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", and `results` will contain 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition that the count of 'U' in `s` is odd or even, respectively, for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` must contain 6 elements, where the 6th element is either `'YES'` or `'NO'`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - The `results` list still contains 6 elements.
   - For the next iteration, the loop will use the 5th element of the `results` list.

### Final State:
- `results` must still contain 6 elements.
- The `result` variable will now refer to the 5th element of the `results` list.

### Answer:
State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` must still contain 6 elements, `result` refers to the 5th element of the `results` list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
