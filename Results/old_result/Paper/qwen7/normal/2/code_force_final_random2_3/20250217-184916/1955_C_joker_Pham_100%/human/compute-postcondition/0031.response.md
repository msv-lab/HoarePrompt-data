Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and its current value is `a[l] * 2 - 1`; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1; `sumk` is 0; the current value of `l` is equal to `r`; `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. The current value of `k` is equal to `a[l] * 2 - 1`; `sunks` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the value of `k` was being updated. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables but rather exits a block of code, the values of the variables remain unchanged except for the fact that we now know the execution has broken out of the loop or conditional.
