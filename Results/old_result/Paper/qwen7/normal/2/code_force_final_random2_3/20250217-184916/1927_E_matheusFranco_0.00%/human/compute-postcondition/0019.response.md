Output State: `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `k`-th element starting from `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which is initially 1 and increases by `k` each iteration) is set to the value of `curr_v` incremented by the number of iterations minus one, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `curr_v` is `curr_v + 3` (since it increments by 1 each iteration), `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the last updated index plus `k`.

To explain this in more detail:
- The loop continues to increment `permutation` at indices that are multiples of `k` plus the initial value of `i` (which starts at 1 and increases by `k` each iteration).
- After all iterations, `permutation` will contain the sequence of numbers starting from `curr_v` (which starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration) placed at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the initial value of `i`.
- The final value of `curr_v` will be the initial value plus the total number of iterations minus one.
- The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be the last index that was updated plus `k`.
