Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `n`, `k`, and `x` are their respective integer values from the input split by spaces, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `k` is a non-negative integer. If `i` equals 0, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` contains the value of `sums`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` now contains `[sums]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated according to the condition `i + x - 1 < n`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`, and `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` with `ans.append(sums)` having been executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` remains unchanged, `sums` is either `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` or `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` depending on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`. If the condition is true, `ans` is a list containing `[sums]`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums` if the condition is met, or it appends `sums` to itself.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
