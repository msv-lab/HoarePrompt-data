Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is increased by `n // curr`, `n` is decreased by `curr`.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is set to `n // i`, which means `curr` is the integer division of `n` by `i`. Then, `h` is increased by `curr`, and `n` is decreased by `curr`. The list `costs` remains unchanged.
