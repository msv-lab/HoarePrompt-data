Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not accurately calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid. The logic in `func_2` seems overly complex and does not align with the problem's requirements. The correct approach involves simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position and counting the steps until it leaves the grid. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and does not handle the inversion of the grid characters as specified.
