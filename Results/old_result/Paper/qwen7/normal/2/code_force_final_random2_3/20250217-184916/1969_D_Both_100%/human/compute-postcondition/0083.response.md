Output State: **`combined` is empty, `heap` is an empty list, `k` is the return value of `func_2()`, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `prices` is a list generated by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the return value of `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `bonuses = list(func_2())` assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `bonuses`. Since `func_2()` returns a list, `bonuses` now holds this list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
