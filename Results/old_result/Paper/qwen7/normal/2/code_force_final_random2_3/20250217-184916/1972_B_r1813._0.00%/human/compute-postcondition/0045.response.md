Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for result in results:` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - The `results` list still contains 6 elements.
   - For the next iteration, the loop will use the 5th element of the `results` list.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - Since the loop will use the 5th element of the `results` list in the next iteration, the `result` variable will refer to the 5th element of the `results` list.
   - The `results` list itself should still contain 6 elements because the loop is simply accessing an element from the list; it does not modify the list length.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `result` refers to the 5th element of the `results` list, and `results` still contains 6 elements.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` must still contain 6 elements, `result` refers to the 5th element of the `results` list**
