Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `u` is the first integer from the input split, `v` is the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The initial conditions for `n`, `i`, `u`, and `v` are updated accordingly. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it must be greater than 1, and `i` remains 3. `u` and `v` now hold the integer values from the input split.
