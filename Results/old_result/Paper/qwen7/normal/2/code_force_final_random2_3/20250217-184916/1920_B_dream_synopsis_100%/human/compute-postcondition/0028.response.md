Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[1]`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `ans.append(sums)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is initially `sums + a[1]`, the value of `ans` becomes a list containing this value. The values of `i`, `k`, and `sums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
