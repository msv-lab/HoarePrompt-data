Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The program reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'.
3. It initializes two counters, `l` and `h`, to zero. `l` will count the occurrences of 'A', and `h` will count the occurrences of 'B'.
4. It iterates through each character in the string and increments the appropriate counter (`l` for 'A' and `h` for 'B').
5. After counting the characters, it compares the values of `l` and `h`. If `l` is greater than `h`, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
6. This process is repeated for all test cases.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently in each string and prints the result accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
