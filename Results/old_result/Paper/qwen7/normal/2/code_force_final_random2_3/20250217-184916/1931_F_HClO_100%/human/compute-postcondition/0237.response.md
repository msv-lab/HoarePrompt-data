Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Given `i = n - 2`, the next value of `i` would be `n - 1`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` will increment by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` must still be at least 1.
   - `i` will be `n - 1`.
   - `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged**.
