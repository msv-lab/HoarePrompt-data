Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length between 1 and 100, inclusive, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D". It returns 'YES' if the string can be read from start to finish without ever having more "D" than "U" at any point; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
