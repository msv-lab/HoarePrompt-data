Output State: **`left` is 0, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, and `i` is the last character in `sChar`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `left` to 0. The values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `s` is still a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, and `i` is still the last character in `sChar`.
