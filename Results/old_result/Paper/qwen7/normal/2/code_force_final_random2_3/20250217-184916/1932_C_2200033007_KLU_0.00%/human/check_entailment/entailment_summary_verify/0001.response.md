### Reasoning

The original assessment was accurate. Let's break down the issues in the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Processing of Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly processes the commands by appending elements to the list `b` instead of computing the product of the array elements and taking the remainder.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem description. Specifically, it appends elements to `b` based on the direction ('L' or 'R') but does not compute the product or take the remainder.

2. **Incorrect Computation of Product and Remainder:**
   - The program should compute the product of the remaining elements of the array after each command and take the remainder with `m`.
   - The current implementation does not do this; it only appends elements to `b` and then computes their product in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.

3. **Reversed List Computation:**
   - The reversed list computation in the original function is unnecessary and incorrect. The problem requires the remainders to be computed in the order of the commands, not in reverse.

### Correct Implementation

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Compute the product of the current state of the array
        for j in range(i):
            product = (product * a[j]) % m
        # Process the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
        # Append the remainder of the product to the result list
        ans.append(product)
    return ans
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

1. **Initialization:**
   - `product` is initialized to 1.
   - `ans` is used to store the results.

2. **Loop through Commands:**
   - For each command, update the `product` by multiplying the current state of the array and taking the remainder with `m`.
   - Depending on the command (`'L'` or `'R'`), remove the appropriate element from the array.
   - Append the current `product` to `ans`.

3. **Return Result:**
   - Return the list `ans` containing the remainders after each command.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the product of the array elements and take the remainder at each step. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
