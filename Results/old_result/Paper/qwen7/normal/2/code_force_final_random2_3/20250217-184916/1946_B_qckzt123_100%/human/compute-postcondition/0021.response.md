Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x`, `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is `max(0, tmp)`, where `tmp` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer read from input.
   - `k` is an integer read from input.
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining.
   - `s` is the sum of all elements in the remaining list `a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element `x` in `a`, at the end of the previous iteration, `x` would be the last element processed.
   - `a` must have at least one element remaining for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `tmp` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `a` must have at least one element remaining, and since `x` was the last element processed, `a` now has `len(a) - 1` elements.
- `s` is the sum of all elements in the remaining list `a`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is `max(0, 0)`, `tmp` is 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining, `s` is the sum of all elements in the remaining list `a`**.
