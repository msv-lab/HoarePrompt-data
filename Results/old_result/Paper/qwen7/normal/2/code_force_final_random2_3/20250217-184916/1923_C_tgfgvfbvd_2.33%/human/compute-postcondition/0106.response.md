Output State: **`c` is increased by `x_next` + `x`, `l` must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c`.**

Explanation: The initial state had `c` increased by `x_next`, `l` having at least one element, and `p` being a list containing the value of `c`. After executing `c += x`, the value of `c` is further increased by `x`. Therefore, `c` is now increased by `x_next + x`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
