Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `index` is 6
   - `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 1
   - `n` is 4
   - `path` is the fifth element of `data` converted to an integer
   - `results` contains the return value of `func_1(path)`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since the loop is based on `t`, we need to decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration. The other variables (`index`, `n`, `path`, `results`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**: After decrementing `t` by 1, the new value of `t` will be the first element of `data` converted to an integer and then decremented by 2 (since it was already decremented by 1 in the previous iteration).

Given the above steps, the new state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`index` is 6, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 2, `n` is 4, `path` is the fifth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(path)`**
