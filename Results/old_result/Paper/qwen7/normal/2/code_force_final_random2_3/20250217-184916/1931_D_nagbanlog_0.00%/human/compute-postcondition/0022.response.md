Postcondition: `a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is not in `freq`, `a` remains unchanged and `beautiful_count` also remains unchanged. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 0.
