Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and the current value of `x` is not divisible by `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. Since `i` is 1, `x // i` is simply `x`. However, without knowing the initial value of `ans`, we cannot specify its exact value. We only know that `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its original value and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
