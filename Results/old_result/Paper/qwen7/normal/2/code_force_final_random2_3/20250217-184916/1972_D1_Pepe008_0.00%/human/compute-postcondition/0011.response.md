Postcondition: `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])` and must be at least 1, `suma` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1` if `(a - i * (i - 1))` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `x` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`. If `(a - i * (i - 1))` is not greater than 0, the values of `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
