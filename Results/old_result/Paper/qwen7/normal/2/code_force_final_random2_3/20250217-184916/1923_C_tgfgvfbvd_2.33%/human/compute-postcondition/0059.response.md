Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `x` and `l`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l` contains at least one element.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is the initial value of `c` plus twice the previous value of `x`.
   - `l` must contain at least one fewer element.
   - `p` is a list containing the value of `c` from the previous iteration and now also contains the current value of `c`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is being iterated over from `l`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in `l`.
   - `l` will have one fewer element than it had at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `c` will be updated based on the new value of `x` (it will be the initial value of `c` plus twice the new value of `x`).
   - `p` will contain the previous value of `c` and the new value of `c`.

Given these points, let's construct the state for the start of the next iteration:

- `c` will be the initial value of `c` plus twice the new value of `x`.
- `l` will have one fewer element than it had at the end of the previous iteration.
- `p` will contain the previous value of `c` and the new value of `c`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `c` and `x` from the previous iteration, we can express the state in terms of the changes:

**State: **`c` is the initial value of `c` plus twice the new value of `x`, `l` must contain at least one fewer element, `p` is a list containing the previous value of `c` and the current value of `c`**.
