Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string from the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new string `s`, `b` is a string which is the sorted version of the input string `s`, `c` is a string which is the sorted version of the input string `s` but in descending order.**

This postcondition remains the same in both the if and else parts, indicating that regardless of whether the condition `b == s` is true or false, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change from their initial states defined in the precondition.
