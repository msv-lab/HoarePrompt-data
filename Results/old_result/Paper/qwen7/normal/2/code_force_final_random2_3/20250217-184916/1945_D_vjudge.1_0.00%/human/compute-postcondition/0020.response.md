Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `k`, `pref` is equal to `lista_A[0]` + `soma_b` + `lista_A[1]`, and `soma_b` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `soma_b` to 0. Since `soma_b` was previously defined as part of the expression for `pref`, its new value (0) will be used in the expression for `pref`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `lista_A[0]`, `lista_A[1]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
