The function processes a specified number of test cases (determined by the initial value of `t`). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even), then calls another function `func_1()` to process these values. After processing all test cases, it outputs a non-positive integer (`t` becomes 0 or negative).
