Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`, `i` is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\), `k` must be at least \(2^i\), `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 0, `1 << j` evaluates to `1`. Therefore, the list `ans` now includes this new value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
