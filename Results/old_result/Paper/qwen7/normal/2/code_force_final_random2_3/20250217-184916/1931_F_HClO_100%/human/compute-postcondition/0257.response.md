Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is not -1, `val` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `idx1 = n - 2` assigns the value `n - 2` to `idx1`. All other variables (`i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx2`, and `val`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
