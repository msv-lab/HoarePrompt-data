Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The initial state had `t` as `t - 1`. The code then takes two inputs separated by a space and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the inputs are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split(' '))`, `n` and `k` are now integer values. The value of `t` is updated to `t - 2` because the initial state of `t` was `t - 1` and it does not get reassigned in the given code snippet.
