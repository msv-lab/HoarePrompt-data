State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer representing the number of children, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions, and `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively.**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not require adjustment.
- The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is the input integer, it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`) are not modified within the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.
