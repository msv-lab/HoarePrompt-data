Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is mentioned to be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, but no specific value for `n` is provided in the current context.

Given the print statement:

```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

We know:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value precisely.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with the following components:
- The literal string `'?'`
- The value of `mak` (which is unknown)
- The value of `mak` (which is unknown)
- The value of `i`, which is 2
- The value of `i`, which is 2

Output: **'? [mak] [mak] 2 2'**
