Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is non-zero.
3. **Determine the initial state**: The initial state is given as `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` is initially an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it already satisfies this condition.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
