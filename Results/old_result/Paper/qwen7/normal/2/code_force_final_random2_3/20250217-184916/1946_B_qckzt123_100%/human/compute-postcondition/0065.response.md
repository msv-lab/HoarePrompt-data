Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is 0, `ans` is 48 modulo MOD, `k` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `tmp` is 0, `x` is the second element of `a`, `t` is 0**

Explanation: The line `t = max(tmp, t)` sets `t` to the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`. Since both `tmp` and `t` are initially 0, `t` remains 0 after executing this line. All other variables (`i`, `ans`, `k`, `s`, `tmp`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
