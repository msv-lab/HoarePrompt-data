Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans1` includes the element at index 0 of `l`; `ans1` is updated by appending the element at index 2 of `l`; `ans2` includes the element at index 1 of `l`; `ans2` now includes the element at index `i` of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans2` now includes the element at index 2 of `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
