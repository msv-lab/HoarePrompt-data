Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer input received; n is undefined.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input for `t` is specified to be an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is now set to this integer value. The variable `n` is not defined yet because no value has been assigned to it.
