Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `a` is `-1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0`.**

Explanation: The initial state for `t` is given as `t - 2`, which means `t` is already set to `t - 2`. The variable `a` is assigned the tuple `(-1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0)`. Here, `*r()` suggests that `r()` is a function call that unpacks its return value into the tuple. However, since the actual return value of `r()` is not specified, it remains as `*r()`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `t` and the unchanged tuple assignment for `a`.
