Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `idx2` is `i`, `idx1` is the new value of `i + 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were, and `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `idx2 = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `idx2`. Since `i` was previously incremented by 1, `idx2` now holds that incremented value. The other variables (`idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
