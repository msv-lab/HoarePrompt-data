Output State: **`new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\), and `j` is \(k + 1\); `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\), `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\), and `i` is \(2 \times n + 2\)**.

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\). Since the condition \(j - 1 \geq 0\) is satisfied (as per the initial state), both `new_dp[j - 1]` and `new_dp[j + 1]` are updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\) and \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\) respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged at \(2 \times n + 2\).
