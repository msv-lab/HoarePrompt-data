Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `char` and `expression`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `count` is initially 0.
   - `expression` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `expression`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in the `expression` string. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the `expression` string.

4. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each character in `expression`, the initial state of `expression` must be such that it has at least one character for the loop to start executing.
   - The variable `char` will take on the value of each character in `expression` during each iteration, but its initial state is not relevant for determining if the loop can start.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of `expression`. Specifically, `expression` must be a non-empty string (i.e., it must have at least one character).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`expression` is a non-empty string consisting of characters `+` and `-`**.
