Output State: **The `digits` list is sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `digits.sort()` sorts the `digits` list in place, meaning the original `digits` list is modified to be in ascending order. The `letters` list remains unchanged, and the fact that all characters from the original `password` have been processed is still valid.
