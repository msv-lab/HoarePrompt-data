### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step using the provided function summary and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - It calculates `y = n + x`.

3. **Checking Parity of `y`:**
   - The condition `if y % 2 != 0:` correctly identifies when `y` is odd, ensuring that the settling pattern cannot exist in such cases, which is correct.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - It calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and stores the result in `L1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the result of another call to `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`.

5. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - It converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and then calculates the length of the set.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It correctly iterates through the divisors and checks the conditions to ensure that the divisors are valid.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Parity Check:**
   - The condition `if y % 2 != 0:` correctly identifies when `y` is odd, ensuring that the settling pattern cannot exist in such cases, which is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` aims to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The approach of checking both `i` and `q // i` ensures that all relevant divisors are considered.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the square root `w` of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

3. **Combining Results:**
   - The combination of results from `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` is handled correctly.
   - The use of a set to remove duplicates before calculating the length is appropriate.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `n` is very large and `x` is small, ensuring that the calculations do not overflow or produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

Upon re-evaluation, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of possible values of `k` that satisfy the given conditions. The function `func_1` accurately finds the divisors of `q` that meet the criteria, and the main program correctly combines and counts these divisors.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
