Output State: **`ans` is 3, `s` is the substring from the start of `s` to the character before 'm', followed by the substring from the character after 'p' to the end of `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The variable `s` remains unchanged as the code does not modify its value.
