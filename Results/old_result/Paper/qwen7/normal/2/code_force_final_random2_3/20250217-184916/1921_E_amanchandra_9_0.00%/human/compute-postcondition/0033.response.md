Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers from the input, `l` and `r` are integers with their previous values, `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2.**

This means that the variable `x` is now set to the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, divided by 2. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
