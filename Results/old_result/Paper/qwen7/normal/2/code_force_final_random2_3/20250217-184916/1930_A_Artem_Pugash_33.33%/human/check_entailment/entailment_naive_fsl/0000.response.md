Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the score. The issue lies in the way pairs are selected for each move. The program simply pops the smallest two numbers from the sorted list and adds their minimum value to the score. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible score.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

However, the program's output would be:
```
1
```

This is because the program always takes the two smallest numbers (1, 1) and adds 1 to the score, repeating this process three times. Instead, the optimal strategy would be to pair the largest numbers with the smallest ones to maximize the score. For example, pairing (1, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 1) would yield a score of 3, which is the correct maximum score for this case.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
