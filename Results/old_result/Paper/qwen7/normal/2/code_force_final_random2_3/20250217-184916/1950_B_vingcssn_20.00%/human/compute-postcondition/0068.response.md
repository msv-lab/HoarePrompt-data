Output State: **`casos` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), `n` is an integer input by the user, `c` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`casos`, `t`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
