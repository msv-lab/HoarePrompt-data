Postcondition: `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, all elements are 0, `i` is 2 * n + 1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where each element `new_dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 * n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`, and there exists at least one `j` such that `dp[j] > 0`. The current value of `j` satisfies `j + 1 <= 2 * n`.
