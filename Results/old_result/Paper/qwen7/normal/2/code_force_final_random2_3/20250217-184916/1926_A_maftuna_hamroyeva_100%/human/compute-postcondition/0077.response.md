Output State: **`j` is a string, `l` is incremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1 in the next iteration**.

In this case, the code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The initial state mentions that `l` is incremented by 1 if `j` is 'A' in the next iteration, but since `j` is a string and no condition is met here, the value of `l` is simply incremented by 1. The value of `h` is also mentioned to be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, which remains unchanged by this line of code.
