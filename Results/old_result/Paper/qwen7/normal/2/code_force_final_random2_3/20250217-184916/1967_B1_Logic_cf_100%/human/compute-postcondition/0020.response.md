Output State: **`ans` is increased by (n + b) // (b * b), `b` must be within the range 2 to min(n, m) + 1, [n, m] is a list containing the integer values of the split input strings.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it. The value of `b` remains within its original range, and the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are part of the list `[n, m]`.
