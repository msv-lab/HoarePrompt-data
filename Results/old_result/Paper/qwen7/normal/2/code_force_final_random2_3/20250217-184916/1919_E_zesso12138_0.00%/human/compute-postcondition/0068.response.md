Output State: **`j` is 2 * `n` + 1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of 2 * `n` + 1 zeros, `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `j` is set to `2 * n + 1`.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `dp` is equal to `new_dp`.
- `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` zeros.

After executing the line `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Since `new_dp` is a list of zeros initially, `new_dp[j + 1]` was 0 before the update. Thus, the new value of `new_dp[j + 1]` becomes `(0 + dp[j]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `dp[j] % MOD`.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `new_dp[j + 1]` as described above.
