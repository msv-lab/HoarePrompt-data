Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered by the user as a string, and the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`; `results` is a list containing the string 'no'**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('no')` appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending `'no'`, the list contains only one element, which is `'no'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
