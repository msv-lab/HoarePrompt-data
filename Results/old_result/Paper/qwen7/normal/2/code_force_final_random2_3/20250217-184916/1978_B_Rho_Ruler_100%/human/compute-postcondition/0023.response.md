Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `low <= high`.

2. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition**: The variables that affect whether the loop continues are `low` and `high`. The values of `mid`, `profit_mid`, `max_profit`, and `profit_next` do not directly affect the loop condition.

3. **Analyze the Loop Body**:
   - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then:
     - `low` is updated to `mid + 1`
     - `high` remains unchanged
     - `mid` is recalculated as (`low` + `high`) // 2
     - `profit_mid` is updated to the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`
     - `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`
   - Otherwise (if `profit_next` is not greater than `profit_mid`), then:
     - `low` remains unchanged
     - `high` is updated to `mid - 1`
     - `mid` is recalculated as (`low` + `high`) // 2
     - `profit_mid` is updated to the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`
     - `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `low <= high` must hold true.
   - If `low > high` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will terminate.
   - Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `low` and `high` such that `low <= high`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `max_profit`, and `profit_next` are as follows: if `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` is recalculated as (`low` + `high`) // 2, `profit_mid` is updated to the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` is not updated. Otherwise, `low` remains unchanged, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated as (`low` + `high`) // 2, `profit_mid` is updated to the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` is not updated.**
