Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `r` is an input string.
   - `prev` is equal to `i`.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop condition `i < n` will be false.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop does not execute again, there are no changes to `i` or `n`.
   - The values of `r` and `prev` remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case does not occur) remains the same as the current state.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i`, and `i` is equal to `n`**
