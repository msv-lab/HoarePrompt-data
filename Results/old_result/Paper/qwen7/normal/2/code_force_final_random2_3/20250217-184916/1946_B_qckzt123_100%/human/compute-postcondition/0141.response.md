Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 * 10^5 and the total sum of `n` and `k` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a value based on the given conditions.**

Given that the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information, the focus is on the parameters accepted by the function and their constraints.
