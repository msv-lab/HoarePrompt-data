Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the last element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the last element of `palka`; `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Here, `i` is the last element of the list `palka`. The lists `palka` and `pl` remain unchanged, with `pl` still containing the last element of `palka`.
