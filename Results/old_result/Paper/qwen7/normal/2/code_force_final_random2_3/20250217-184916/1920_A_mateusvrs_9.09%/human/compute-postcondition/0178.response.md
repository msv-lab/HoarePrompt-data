Functionality: **The function processes a series of constraints defined by pairs of integers (a, x), where a can be 1, 2, or 3, and x ranges from 1 to 10^9. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the maximum and minimum values of x for types 1 and 2, respectively, and the count of x values that fall within the range [bx, ax]. If the maximum value for type 1 constraints (bx) is greater than or equal to the minimum value for type 2 constraints (ax), the result is 0. Otherwise, the result is the difference between ax and bx, adjusted by subtracting the count of x values within the range [bx, ax] from this difference. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
