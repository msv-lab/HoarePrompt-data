Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 2 * (n + 3)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.

This means that the `data` remains unchanged, the `index` is updated to `index + 2 * (n + 3)`, `t` is decreased by 1, `p` is a list of integers from `data` starting at the new `index` and of length `n`, and `result` holds the return value from the function call `func_1(n, p)`.
