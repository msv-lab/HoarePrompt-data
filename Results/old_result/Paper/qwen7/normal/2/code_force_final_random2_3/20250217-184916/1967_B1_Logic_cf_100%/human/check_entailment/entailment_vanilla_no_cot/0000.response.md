Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` used in the loop does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement.

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

This solution iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, which ensures correctness according to the problem statement.
