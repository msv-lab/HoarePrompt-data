Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ans1` includes the elements at indices 0 to `n-3` of `l`, and `ans2` includes the elements at indices 1 to `n-2` of `l` twice each.**

Explanation: Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(l) - 1` and `len(l)` is `n-1`, the loop will execute `n-1` times. Given that `k` starts at `-2 * (n-1)` and is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, it will reach 0 after `n-1` iterations. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be `n` (since it starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each time through the loop). The variable `ans1` will include the elements from index 0 to `n-3` of `l` because the loop appends each element of `l` to `ans1` once. Similarly, `ans2` will include the elements from index 1 to `n-2` of `l` twice each, as it appends each element to `ans2` twice during each iteration of the loop.
