Output State: **`combined` is now one element smaller, `heap` contains the smallest element from `combined`, and `k` is `k - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops the last element from `combined` and pushes it into the heap. Since `combined` must be non-empty for `k` to be decremented, `k` is decremented by 1 after this operation. The heap now contains the smallest element from the original `combined`.
