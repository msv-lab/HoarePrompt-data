Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range from `0` to `len(digits) - 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an index of `digits`.
   - The function returns `False`.
   - If `i` is less than the length of `digits` minus 1 and the digit at index `i` is greater than the digit at index `i + 1`, the function returns `False`.

4. **Consider the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(digits) - 1`.
   - If `i` is at the last possible index (i.e., `len(digits) - 1`), the loop will stop.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - If `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1`, increment `i` by 1.
   - If `i` is equal to `len(digits) - 1`, the loop will terminate.

Given the postcondition that the function returns `False`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 if it is less than `len(digits) - 1`.
- If `i` is equal to `len(digits) - 1`, the loop will terminate.

Since the function always returns `False` under the given conditions, the state remains the same for the purpose of the loop continuation.

State: **`i` is an index of `digits` and is less than `len(digits) - 1`, and the program returns False.**
