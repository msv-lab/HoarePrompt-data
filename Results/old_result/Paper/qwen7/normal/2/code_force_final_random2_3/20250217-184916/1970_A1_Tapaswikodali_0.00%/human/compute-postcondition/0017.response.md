Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is either 1 or 2, `balance` is either 0, -2, 2, or 0 depending on the first and second characters of `s`, `details` is a list containing three tuples where the first tuple is (balance, -i, char)**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the list `details`. The variables `s`, `i`, and `balance` retain their initial values. The `details` list now contains one additional tuple compared to its initial state.
