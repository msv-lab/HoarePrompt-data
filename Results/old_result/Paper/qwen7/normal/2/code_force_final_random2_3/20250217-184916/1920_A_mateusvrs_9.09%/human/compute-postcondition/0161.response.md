Postcondition: `tmp` is 1, `n` will be the total number of iterations performed, `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `x` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `ax` will be the smallest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 2, `bx` will be the largest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing all integers provided as `x` when `a` was neither 1 nor 2 and must have at least one element. The current value of `i` satisfies the condition `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`.
