Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is less than `median`, `op` is 1**

The code `op += 1` increments the value of `op` by 1. Since `op` was initially not specified, we assume it was 0 (as no other value is given), so after the operation, `op` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
