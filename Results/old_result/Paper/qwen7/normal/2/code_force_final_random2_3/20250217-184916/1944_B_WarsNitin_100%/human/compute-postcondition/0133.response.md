Output State: **`b` is a sorted version of the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is sorted, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = []` creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable `ans2`. This does not affect the values of `b`, `c`, `n`, `k`, or `ans1`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
