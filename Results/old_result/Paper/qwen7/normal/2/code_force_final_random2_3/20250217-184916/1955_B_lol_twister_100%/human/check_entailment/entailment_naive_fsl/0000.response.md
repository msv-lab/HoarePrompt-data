Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the given array `l` can form a progressive square. Specifically, the program does not check if the generated sequence matches the given array `l` in terms of the unique elements and their positions. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8
```
- Expected Output: "NO"
- Actual Output: "YES"

In this case, the program generates the sequence `[1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12]` and compares it with the sorted input array `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. Since both arrays are sorted and contain the same elements, the program incorrectly returns "YES".

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the generated sequence exactly matches the sorted input array in terms of both the elements and their positions. This requires checking if the generated sequence is a permutation of the input array.
