Reasoning:
- The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to generate a 2n × 2n checkerboard for any given n. The provided code only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and prints fixed patterns for these cases. However, the problem requires a general solution that works for any n within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).
- For values of n other than 1, 2, 3, and 4, the program incorrectly prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range" in English). This is not the correct behavior as per the problem statement, which requires generating the checkerboard pattern for any n in the given range.
- The program lacks the logic to dynamically generate the checkerboard pattern for any given n. It should use nested loops to alternate between '#' and '.' to form the checkerboard pattern.

Correctness: **False**
