Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) representing the length of binary strings, and two binary strings a_1 and a_2 of length n, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The function returns a result based on comparing the two binary strings for each test case.**

Note: The actual comparison logic and return value are not specified in the given information, so the description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
