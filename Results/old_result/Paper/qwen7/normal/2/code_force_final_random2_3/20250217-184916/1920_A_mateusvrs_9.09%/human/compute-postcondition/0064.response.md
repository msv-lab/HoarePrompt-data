Output State: **`bx` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**

The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `x` respectively. The values of `bx`, `n`, `cx`, and `ax` remain unchanged from their initial states.
