Output State: **`E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `D[in_aa] += 1` increments the value of `D[in_aa]` by 1. According to the initial postconditions, if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, it decreases by 1; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` decreases by 1, `pairs_in_D` decreases by 1, and `C[out_aa]` increases by 1, with `E[out_aa]` also decreasing by 1 in both cases. Since the code only affects `D[in_aa]`, and no condition on `E[out_aa]` being greater than 0 is specified, the general rule applies, resulting in the specified changes to the variables.
