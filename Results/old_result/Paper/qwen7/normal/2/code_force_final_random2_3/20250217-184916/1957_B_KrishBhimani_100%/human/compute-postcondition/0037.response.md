Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `i` is a non-negative integer.
   - `ans` is a list containing three elements \([0, (1 << i) - 1, k - (1 << i) - 1]\).
   - `temp` is such that `temp * 2 \>= k`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

Given the structure of `ans`, let's determine the values it contains:
- The first element of `ans` is `0`.
- The second element of `ans` is \((1 << i) - 1\), where `i` is a non-negative integer. This expression represents \(2^i - 1\).
- The third element of `ans` is \(k - (1 << i) - 1\).

Therefore, `ans` is a list of the form \([0, 2^i - 1, k - 2^i - 1]\).

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the second and third elements. However, we know their forms based on the given conditions.

Thus, the print statement will output these three elements separated by spaces.

Output: **0 (1 << i) - 1 k - (1 << i) - 1**
