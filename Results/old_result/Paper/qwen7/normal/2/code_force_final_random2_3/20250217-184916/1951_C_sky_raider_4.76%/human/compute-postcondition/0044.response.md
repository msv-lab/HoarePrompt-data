Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. The original values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `c` is not affected by this line of code, so its definition remains the same. The new variable `l` is created and populated with the integers from the input.
