Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**: The postcondition given is that `i` is 2 and `mak` is 2 if the input string is `<`. Otherwise, the same values of `i` and `mak` are retained.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3 (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).
   - The value of `n` must be such that `i < n` still holds true. Since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Consider the `mak` variable**: The problem does not specify how `mak` changes within the loop body, so we assume it remains unchanged unless explicitly modified. Given the postcondition, if the input string was `<`, then `mak` would be 2. Otherwise, it retains its previous value. Since no further information is provided about the input string, we cannot definitively say if `mak` changes or not. However, based on the loop head, we only need to adjust `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
