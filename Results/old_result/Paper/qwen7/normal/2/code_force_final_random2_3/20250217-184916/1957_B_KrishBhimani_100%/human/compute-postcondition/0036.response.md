Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list containing three elements \([0, (1 << i) - 1, k - (1 << i) - 1]\), and `temp` is such that `temp * 2 \>= k`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends `n - len(ans)` zeros to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains two elements: \((1 << i) - 1\) and `k - (1 << i) - 1`. If `n` is greater than 2, the code will append `n - 2` zeros to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` now contains three elements: \([0, (1 << i) - 1, k - (1 << i) - 1]\). All other variables remain unchanged.
