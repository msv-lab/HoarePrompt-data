### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the absolute difference between the length of `expression` and twice the number of '+' characters in `expression`.
   - This summary suggests that the function is not designed to handle the problem as described in the problem statement, which requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array.

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`), then for each test case, it reads the length of the string `expression` and the string itself.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' characters in `expression` and calculates the penalty as the absolute difference between the length of `expression` and twice the count of '+' characters.
   - This calculation does not align with the problem statement's requirement to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
     ```
     10
     --+++++++-
     ```
     - The correct minimum penalty should be 0, achieved by splitting the array into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`.
     - However, the function `func_1` will incorrectly calculate the penalty as 8, because it does not perform the optimal splitting.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.
   - The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array.
