Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is True**.

Explanation: The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `arr`. The variables `m` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Initially, `ans` was set to `False` only if any condition caused it to be set to `False` during the loop's execution. Since no such condition is mentioned and the code does not change the value of `ans`, `ans` remains `True`.
