Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle a string `path` consisting of characters `@` and `*`. However, the problem description and the provided examples do not mention any string `path`. Instead, the problem involves finding the year when the nth sign occurs based on periodicities.
   - The function `func_1` does not seem to relate to the problem's requirements. It calculates the maximum sum of consecutive `@` characters in a string, which is irrelevant to the periodicity of signs.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases. It correctly extracts the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a_i`).
   - However, it calls `func_1` with the periodicities as a string, which is incorrect based on the problem statement. The function should use the periodicities directly to calculate the year when the nth sign occurs.

Given these observations, both functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Function 1 is entirely unrelated, and Function 2 incorrectly uses the wrong function to process the input.

Correctness: **False**
