Output State: **`idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `n` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to the current value of `i`, which is 1. The conditions involving `n`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
