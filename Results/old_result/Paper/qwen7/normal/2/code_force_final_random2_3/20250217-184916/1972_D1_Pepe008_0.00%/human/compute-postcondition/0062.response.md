Output State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a + 1`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, and `i` is `a + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- Given `i` is `a + 1`, substitute `i` with `a + 1` in the formula:
  \[
  x = (a - (a + 1) * ((a + 1) - 1)) // (a + 1) ** 2 + 1
  \]
  Simplify the expression:
  \[
  x = (a - (a + 1) * a) // (a + 1) ** 2 + 1
  \]
  \[
  x = (a - a^2 - a) // (a + 1) ** 2 + 1
  \]
  \[
  x = (-a^2) // (a + 1) ** 2 + 1
  \]
- All other variables (`info`, `b`, `suma`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
