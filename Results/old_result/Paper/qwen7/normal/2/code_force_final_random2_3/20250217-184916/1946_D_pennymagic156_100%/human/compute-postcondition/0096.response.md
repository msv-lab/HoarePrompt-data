Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with the next `val`, `op` is now the XOR of the original `op` with `val >> i & 1` (where `i` is the new current index during the iteration), `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the next element of `a` with the next `val`, and `ai` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `op` has been updated to include the new value `val >> i & 1` through the XOR operation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `op` which now includes the new value.
