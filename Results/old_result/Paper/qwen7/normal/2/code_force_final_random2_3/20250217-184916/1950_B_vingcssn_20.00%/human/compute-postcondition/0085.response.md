Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an integer input by the user.
- `c` is 1.

The print statement is simply printing the string `'##..##..'`.

Since no values of `t`, `n`, or `c` are used in the print statement, and the string being printed does not depend on any of these variables, the output will be the literal string provided.

Output: **##..##..**
