Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a sorted version of the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is sorted, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (either 2 times the original value of `k` or 2 times the original value of `k` minus 2), `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the element `b[n-1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is the original value of `k`, and `l` is a list containing `[b[n-1]]` if `b[n-2] != b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and the current value of `k` is 0, resulting in a break from the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, `b[i]` is added to the list `l`, and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `l` is a list containing `b[2]`. If `b[2]` is not equal to `b[3]`, then `l` contains `[b[2], b[3]]`; otherwise, `l` remains as `[b[2]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, and `k` equals 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `l` is a list containing the element `b[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
