Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` that takes three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`.
2. It initializes an array `count` of size 7 to zero, which will store the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
3. It iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` array based on the character's position in the alphabet.
4. It then calculates `needed_problems` by checking how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level to reach at least `m` problems per level.
5. The logic to calculate `needed_problems` is correct. For each difficulty level, if the current count is less than `m`, it adds the difference `(m - count[i])` to `needed_problems`.
6. The function returns the total `needed_problems`.

Given the problem description and the provided execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
