Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `curr` is `n // i`**

Explanation: The code `curr = n // i` assigns the value of `n // i` (integer division of `n` by `i`) to the variable `curr`. The values of `costs` remain unchanged from the initial state, which is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`.
