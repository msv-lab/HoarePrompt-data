Based on the initial state provided:

- `numCuts` is 0.
- `L` is 50001.
- `R` is 50001.
- `x` is 50001.
- `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

The key point here is that the loop continues until `R - L > 1`. Given that both `L` and `R` start at 50001 and the loop condition is `R - L > 1`, the loop will terminate when `R` and `L` converge to the same value, which is 50001. This means that `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` at this point.

When the loop terminates, the value of `L` will be 50001 because it converges with `R`.

Therefore, the `print(L)` statement will print the value of `L`, which is 50001.

Output: **50001**
