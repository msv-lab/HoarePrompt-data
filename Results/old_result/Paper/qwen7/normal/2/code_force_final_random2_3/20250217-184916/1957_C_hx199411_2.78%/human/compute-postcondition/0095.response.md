Postcondition: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` equals `k`, `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted during the loop's final iteration, `num` is the sum of 2 added for each pair of inputs where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`, and `m` is calculated as `n - num`. If `m` equals 0, the function does not change `m`. If `m` equals 1, `m` remains 1 and `dp` will be a list of length 2 where `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. Otherwise, the loop will continue to execute until `i` exceeds `m`, and `dp` will be a list of length `m + 1` where each element is computed based on the recurrence relation \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), with specific initial values and subsequent values following the given formula.**
