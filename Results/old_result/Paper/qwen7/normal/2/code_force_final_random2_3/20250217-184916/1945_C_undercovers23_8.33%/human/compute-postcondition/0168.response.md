Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`.
- `final` is either an empty list or a list containing 0 and sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`.
- If `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains those elements; otherwise, `final` now contains the integer `n`.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(final[0])` is executed.

Let's break down the possible scenarios for `final`:

1. **If `final` is an empty list:** 
   - In this case, `final[0]` would raise an `IndexError` because there are no elements in the list. However, since the question asks for the output and we assume the code does not handle this error, we can infer that the list is not empty.

2. **If `final` contains elements:**
   - `final` contains 0 and sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`.
   - Since `final` is sorted, the first element of `final` will be 0.

3. **If `final` is set to `n`:**
   - This happens if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is less than 50.
   - In this case, `final` becomes the integer `n`.

Given these scenarios, the most precise description is that `final` will contain 0 as its first element unless `c1` is less than 50, in which case `final` would be `n`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `o`, `n`, or `c1`, we can only conclude that the first element of `final` will be 0 if it contains elements.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0**
