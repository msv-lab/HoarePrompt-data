Postcondition: `a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` is incremented by either `0` or `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, and if `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, then `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to `0`. `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `mod_y` (now updated), `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y` (now updated).
