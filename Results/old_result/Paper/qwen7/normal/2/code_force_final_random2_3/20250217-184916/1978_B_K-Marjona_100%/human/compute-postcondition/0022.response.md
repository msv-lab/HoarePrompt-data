Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes t test cases, where t is a positive integer. For each test case, it accepts three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the test cases according to the given constraints.**

Note: Since the specific operation to be performed on the test cases (n, a, b) is not provided in the question, the functionality description focuses on the input structure and constraints.
