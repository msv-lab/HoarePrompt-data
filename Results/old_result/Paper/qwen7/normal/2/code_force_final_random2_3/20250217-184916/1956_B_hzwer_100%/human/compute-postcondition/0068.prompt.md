Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are in the range 1 to n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; input method is changed to `sys.stdin.readline`
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] += 1
    ans = 0
    for x in cnt:
        ans += max(0, x - 1)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The list `cnt` will be a list of length `n`, and `ans` will be the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in `cnt`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `cnt` will contain the counts of each integer from the original list `a`, but reduced by 1 if the count was greater than 1. The variable `ans` will hold the total count of such reductions across all elements in `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `cnt` must contain at least as many elements as there are items in `a`, and `ans` is increased by the maximum of 0 and `x` - 1 for each element `x` in `cnt`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will be the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in `cnt`, where `cnt` contains the count of each unique element in the list `a`. The value of `cnt` will reflect the frequency of each element in `a`, and `ans` will accumulate the adjusted counts (subtracting 1 and ensuring non-negativity) for all elements in `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all keys `x` in `cnt`, `a` is fully processed, `cnt` can contain any number of keys, the number of iterations remaining is `N - len(a)`.

In more detail, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be the cumulative sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every key `x` found in the dictionary `cnt`. The variable `a` will be fully processed, meaning it has been completely traversed or modified as needed. The dictionary `cnt` can contain any number of keys since no operations modify it within the loop. Finally, the number of iterations remaining will be `N - len(a)`, indicating how many more iterations were planned but did not occur due to `a` being fully processed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
