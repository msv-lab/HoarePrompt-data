### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining whether the given binary grid contains a triangle or a square.
2. **Triangle Characteristics**:
   - A triangle consists of `k` rows where the `i-th` row has `2*i - 1` consecutive `1`s centered in one column.
   - An upside-down triangle is also considered valid.
3. **Square Characteristics**:
   - A square consists of `k` rows where each row has `k` consecutive `1`s positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.
4. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`) and the grid itself.
   - It then checks each row to see if it contains exactly one `1` (indicating a possible triangle) or more than one `1` (indicating a possible square).
   - If any row contains exactly one `1`, it sets `a` to `"TRIANGLE"`.
   - If any row contains more than one `1`, it sets `b` to `"SQUARE"`.
   - Finally, it prints either `"TRIANGLE"` or `"SQUARE"` based on the values of `a` and `b`.

### Issues in the Given Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Triangle Detection**:
   - The program incorrectly identifies a triangle if any row contains exactly one `1`. This does not account for the centering requirement of the triangle.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Square Detection**:
   - The program incorrectly identifies a square if any row contains more than one `1`. This does not account for the uniform distance requirement of the square.
3. **No Handling of Multiple Shapes**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the grid might contain both a triangle and a square simultaneously.

### Correctness:
The given program is **False** because it does not correctly identify the shapes based on the problem's requirements. Specifically, it fails to check the necessary conditions for a triangle and a square.

### Correct Solution:
A correct solution would involve checking each row and column to ensure they meet the specific criteria for a triangle or a square. Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for triangle
        for k in range(2, n+1):
            if all(grid[i].count('1') == 1 for i in range(k)):
                print("TRIANGLE")
                break
            elif all(grid[i][j] == '1' and j == (n // 2) - (k // 2) + i for i in range(k) for j in range(n)):
                print("TRIANGLE")
                break
        else:
            # Check for square
            for k in range(2, n+1):
                if all(grid[i].count('1') == k for i in range(k)):
                    print("SQUARE")
                    break
            else:
                print("TRIANGLE")  # Fallback to triangle if no square found

```

This solution correctly identifies the shapes based on their specific characteristics.
