Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; the value of `total_distinct` is less than `k`; `'NO'` is appended to the `results` list.**

The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. The values of `total_distinct` and the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
