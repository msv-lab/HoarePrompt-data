Output State: **`combined` has at least one item less than before, `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of the last item of the original `combined` list, `item` is now the last element of the original `combined` list, `heap` contains the `item` that was heappushed and heappopped, and `max_profit` remains unchanged if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**

Explanation:
- The `pop()` method removes and returns the last item from the `combined` list. Since `item` is set to this last item, `item` now holds the value of the last item from the original `combined` list.
- The `combined` list has at least one item less because the last item has been removed.
- `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of the last item of the original `combined` list, which is now stored in `item`.
- The `heap` contains the `item` that was heappushed and heappopped, as stated in the initial conditions.
- `max_profit` remains unchanged if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, which is still true after the operation.
