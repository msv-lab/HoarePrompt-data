Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 1 << 1, 1 << 3, ..., 1 << 19]`, `i` is 4, `tc` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, and `k` must be at least 16**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged, including `ans`, `tc`, `n`, and `k`.
