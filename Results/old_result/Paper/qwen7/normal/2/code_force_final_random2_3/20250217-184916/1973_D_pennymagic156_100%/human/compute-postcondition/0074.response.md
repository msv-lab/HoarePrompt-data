Output State: **`cnt` is `k - 1` and `cnt` must be non-zero; `l` is `func_2() + 2` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, so `cnt` becomes `k - 1`. The conditions that `cnt` must be non-zero and `l` must be less than `n + 1` remain unchanged. The value of `l` is still `func_2() + 2`, and no other variables are affected.
