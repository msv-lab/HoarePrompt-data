Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the set `cx`.

3. **Determine the postconditions for the loop**:
   - `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1.
   - `i` is one of the elements in `cx`.
   - If the current value of `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, then `tmp` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1.
   - `i` is one of the elements in `cx`.
   - `tmp` has been updated based on the condition (either incremented or unchanged).

5. **Determine the state adjustments for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `cx`, the set `cx` itself does not change.
   - The variable `i` will take the next element from `cx` in the next iteration.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `cx` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` will be the next element in `cx`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, `i` is the next element in `cx`**.
