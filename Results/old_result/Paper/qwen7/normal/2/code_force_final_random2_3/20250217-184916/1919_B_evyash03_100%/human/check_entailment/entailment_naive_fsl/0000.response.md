Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not split the array into optimal subarrays to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' characters and calculates a penalty based on the difference between the count of '+' and '-' characters. This approach does not guarantee the minimum possible penalty.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The correct minimum penalty would be 0, achieved by splitting the array into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`. However, the provided function will incorrectly calculate the penalty as 8.

The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the optimal splits, which the current implementation does not achieve.
