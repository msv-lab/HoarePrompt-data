Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `letters` list is sorted in ascending order. The `digits` list remains sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(digits)):
    if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
        return False
    if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
        return False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `len(digits)` is greater than 0, and either `i` is equal to `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`, and (`i` is not less than `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an index of `digits`, and the program returns False. If `i` is less than the length of `digits` minus 1 and the digit at index `i` is greater than the digit at index `i + 1`, then the function returns False. Since there is no else part, the function always returns False under the given conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an index of `digits` and is less than `len(digits) - 1`. If `i` is such that `i < len(letters)` and `digits[-1] > letters[i]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program does not change the return value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
