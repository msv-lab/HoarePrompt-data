Output State: **`i` is 3, `max` is min(a[3], a[2])**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(a[i], a[i - 1])` to the variable `max`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression inside the function `min` becomes `min(a[3], a[2])`. Since `a[3]` and `a[2]` are not explicitly defined, `max` is set to the minimum value between `a[3]` and `a[2]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged, but since `n` is not used in the code, it is not included in the output state.
