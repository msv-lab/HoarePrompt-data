Output State: **`m` is reduced by 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, `t` is `t-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the second integer input by the user, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `p1` and `p2` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `m`, `n`, `val`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged except that `idx1` and `idx2` are reset to 0 since they were initially set to -1 and are typically incremented or modified within loops or conditions. Here, no such operations are performed, so they are set to 0.
