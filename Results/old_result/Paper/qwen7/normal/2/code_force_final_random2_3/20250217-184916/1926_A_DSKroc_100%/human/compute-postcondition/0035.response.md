Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'A', `ac` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `ac` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `ac` was not specified, we assume it was 0 (as it is a common initialization for counters). After executing `ac += 1`, the value of `ac` becomes 1. The values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged.
