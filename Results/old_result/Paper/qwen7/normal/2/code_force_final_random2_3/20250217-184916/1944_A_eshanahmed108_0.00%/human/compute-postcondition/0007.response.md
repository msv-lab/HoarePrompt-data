Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `n` is equal to the integer input split from the first input, `k` is equal to the integer input split from the second input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this code snippet.
