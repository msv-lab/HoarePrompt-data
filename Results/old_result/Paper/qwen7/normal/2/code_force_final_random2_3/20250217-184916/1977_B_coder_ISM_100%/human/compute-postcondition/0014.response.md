Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of length 30 with an additional element '1' appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since `s` originally had a length of 30, after appending `'1'`, its length becomes 31. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
