The only variable in the loop head is the variable `s`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop continues as long as `s.find('map') != -1`, meaning that the substring 'map' is found in the string `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string without the substring 'map'. For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must contain the substring 'map'.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `s` to include the substring 'map'.

State: **`ans` is 1, `s` is a string containing the substring 'map'**
