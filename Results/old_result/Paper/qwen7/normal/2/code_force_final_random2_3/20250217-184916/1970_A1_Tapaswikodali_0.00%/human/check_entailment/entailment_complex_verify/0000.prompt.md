You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string s is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")", with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, `balance` is either a positive or negative integer depending on whether there are more opening or closing parentheses in `s`, and `details` is a list containing as many tuples as there are characters in `s`. Each tuple in `details` has the form `(balance, -i, char)`, indicating the current balance of parentheses, the negative index of the current character, and the character itself from the original string `s`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, `balance` will reflect the net difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the string `s`. If `balance` is positive, there are more opening parentheses than closing ones; if it's negative, there are more closing parentheses. The `details` list captures the state of the balance at each step of the iteration, providing a detailed trace of how the balance changed with each character processed.
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (a rearranged version of s based on the balance values of its characters)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a given balanced parentheses sequence and returns a rearranged version of the sequence based on the balance of parentheses at each position. Specifically, it calculates the balance of parentheses at each character position, sorts these balances, and then reconstructs the string using the original characters but ordered according to their balance values. If the balance is positive, characters with higher balance values come first, and if the balance is negative, characters with lower balance values come first.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. Specifically, the sorting step in the program uses `-i` to break ties in decreasing order of position, but the problem description requires ties to be broken in decreasing order of position, not negative position. This means that the program will not produce the correct balanced shuffle for sequences where the order of characters with the same prefix balance needs to be reversed.

For example, consider the input `((())())`. According to the problem description, the steps would be:

1. Compute the prefix balances and store them along with the positions and characters:
   ```
   Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1| 0| 1
   ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
   Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9| 10
   Character| (| (| (| )| (| )| )| )| (| )
   ```

2. Sort the columns by prefix balance, breaking ties by decreasing position:
   ```
   Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3| 0| 1
   ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
   Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6| 9| 10
   Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )| (| )
   ```

3. The last row forms the balanced shuffle: `()((())())`.

However, the provided program sorts using `-i`, which results in the wrong order for the tied positions. The correct output should be `()((())())`, but the program might produce an incorrect output due to the incorrect tie-breaking mechanism.
