Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v2` is 2 (this variable is not involved in the loop head).

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` is now 3).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `v2` is 2**
