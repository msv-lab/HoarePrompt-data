Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q); `M` is an empty list, `w` is the square root of `q`.**

This means that the value of `q` remains unchanged, `x` also remains unchanged, and `M` remains an empty list. However, `w` is now assigned the value of the square root of `q`.
