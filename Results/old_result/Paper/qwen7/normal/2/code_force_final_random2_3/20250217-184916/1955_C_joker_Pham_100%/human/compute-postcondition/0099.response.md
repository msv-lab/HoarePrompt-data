Output State: **Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `sunks` is incremented by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since no further operations are performed after the `break`, the values of `k`, `sunks`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `r` remain unchanged from their preconditions. The only change is that the execution breaks out of the loop or if statement.
