Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` remains the same as the initial value, `s` remains the same as the initial value, and `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `l`. The values of `i`, `c`, `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
