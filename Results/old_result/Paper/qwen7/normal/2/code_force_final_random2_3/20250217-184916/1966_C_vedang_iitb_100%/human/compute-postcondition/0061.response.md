Output State: **`tc` is the previous value of `tc` + 1, `t` is the same as before, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `tc`, `t`, `n`, or `maxsize`. The list `a` is updated to its sorted version.
