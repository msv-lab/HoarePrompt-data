Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (new value entered by the user), `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from input split by spaces, `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and splits them by spaces, assigning them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. It then calculates `k` as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. However, since the initial value of `t` is not used in this operation, it remains unchanged. The conditions regarding `b` being less than or equal to `a` or vice versa do not affect the calculation of `k` as the operation is already defined to take the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
