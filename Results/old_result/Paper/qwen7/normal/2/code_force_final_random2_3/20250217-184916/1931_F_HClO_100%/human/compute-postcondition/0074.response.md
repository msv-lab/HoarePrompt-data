Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **What Happens Inside the Loop:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, we know:
     - If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to `n` and `i`.
     - If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `idx2` is set to 1, and the loop exits.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will run as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - Given that `n` must be at least 2, the smallest possible value for `n` is 2.
   - Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 1` to `n - 1`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Hence, `i` will become 2.
   - Since `n` must remain at least 2, `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2**
