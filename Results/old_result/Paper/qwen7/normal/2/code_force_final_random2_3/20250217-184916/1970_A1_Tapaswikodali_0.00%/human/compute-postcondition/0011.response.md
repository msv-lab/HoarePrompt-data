Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `enumerate(s)` function, which returns pairs of an index and a character from the string `s`. Therefore, the relevant variables in the loop head are `i` and `char`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")".
   - `i` is 0.
   - `balance` is either 1 or -1 depending on the first character of `s`.
   - `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, -i, char)` where `char` is the first character of `s`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. This means that the loop will execute again if `i < len(s)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The `char` variable will now hold the second character of the string `s`.
   - The `balance` and `details` variables remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `s` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `balance` remains either 1 or -1.
   - `details` remains a list containing one tuple `(balance, -1, char)` where `char` is the first character of `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 1, `balance` is either 1 or -1 depending on the first character of `s`, `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, -1, char)` where `char` is the first character of `s`.**
