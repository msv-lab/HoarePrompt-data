Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer input by the user, and `arr` is the string input by the user.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `results`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
