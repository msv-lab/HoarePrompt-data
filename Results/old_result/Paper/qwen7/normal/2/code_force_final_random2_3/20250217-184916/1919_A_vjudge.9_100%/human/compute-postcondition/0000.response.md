Output State: **a is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, t is an integer input from the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the integer value entered by the user to the variable `t`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
