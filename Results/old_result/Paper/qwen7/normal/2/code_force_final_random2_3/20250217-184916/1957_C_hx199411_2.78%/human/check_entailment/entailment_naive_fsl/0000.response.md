Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic used to update `num` does not accurately reflect the number of valid positions left on the board after the given moves.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3
4 1
1 2
8 1
7 6
1000 4
4 4
952 343
222 333
90 91
```

The program's logic for updating `num` is flawed because it increments `num` by 1 or 2 based on whether the coordinates are the same or different, respectively. However, this does not account for the fact that after placing a rook, the number of valid positions decreases by more than just 1 or 2.

For example, in the first test case with a 4x4 board and one move at (1, 2), the program would incorrectly calculate `num` as 3 instead of 2. This is because the program does not properly handle the reduction in valid positions after placing a rook.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to maintain a set of rows and columns that are occupied and then calculate the number of valid positions left for placing rooks. The program should then use dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations based on the remaining valid positions.
