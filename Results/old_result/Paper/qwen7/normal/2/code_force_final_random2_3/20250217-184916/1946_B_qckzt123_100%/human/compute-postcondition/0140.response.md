Output State: `i` is equal to `k-1`, `t` is equal to `2^(k-1) % MOD`, and `ans` is equal to `(2^k - 1) % MOD`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `k-1` because the loop runs `k-1` times. The variable `t` will hold the value `2^(k-1) % MOD` since it gets doubled in each iteration and takes modulo `MOD`. The variable `ans` will accumulate the sum of `t` values from `2^0 % MOD` to `2^(k-2) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(2^k - 1) % MOD` due to the properties of geometric series sums in modular arithmetic.
