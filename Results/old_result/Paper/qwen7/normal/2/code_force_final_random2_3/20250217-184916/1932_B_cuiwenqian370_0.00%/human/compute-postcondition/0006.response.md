Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the second element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is a string, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of the element at the current index (`index` which is 1) of the list `data` to the variable `n`. After this assignment, `index` is incremented by 1 (to 2) because the next element in `data` is being accessed. All other variables remain unchanged.
