You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, m, k) representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. Additionally, n, m, and k satisfy 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), and k is even. Arrays a and b are represented as lists of integers, where each element in a and b satisfies 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        
        unique_b = set(b)
        
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        results.append('YES')
        
    #State: The `results` list contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The length of the `results` list is equal to the number of test cases in the `cases` list.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' which contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The length of the 'results' list is equal to the number of test cases in the 'cases' list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, m, k) representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. The function returns a list named 'results', where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The length of the 'results' list is equal to the number of test cases in the 'cases' list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named 'results' which contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The length of the 'results' list is equal to the number of test cases in the 'cases' list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
