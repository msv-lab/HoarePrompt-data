Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling can be explained by the described pattern.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) need to fit into this pattern.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of \( \frac{y-2}{2} \) that are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function calculates all divisors of \( \frac{y-2}{2} \) and adds them to the list `M` if they are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).
   - This ensures that the divisors represent possible values of \( k \) that could match Vasya's position and number.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with \( \frac{y-2}{2} \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and calls `func_1` again if true.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the unique elements in the list returned by `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) and \( 1 \leq x < q \) are handled appropriately.
   - The logic for handling the divisors and ensuring they are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \) is sound.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
