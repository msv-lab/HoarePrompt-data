Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `numbers != []`.
2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: The only variable in the loop head is `numbers`, so we can only adjust this one.
3. **Current state of `numbers`**: The state right before the loop is that `numbers` is a list of strings sorted in ascending order.
4. **Condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute the first time, `numbers` must not be an empty list.

Given that `numbers` is a list of strings sorted in ascending order, it needs to be non-empty for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state of `numbers` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is not an empty list.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` must not be an empty list, `suma` is 0**
