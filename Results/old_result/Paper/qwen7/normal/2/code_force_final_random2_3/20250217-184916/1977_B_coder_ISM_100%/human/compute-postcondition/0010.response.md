Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing '0' and 29 more empty elements, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, and `(x & pow(2, i))` is false.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s.append('0')` appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is an empty list with a length of 30. After appending `'0'`, `s` now contains `'0'` and 29 more empty elements, maintaining its length of 30. The other variables remain unchanged.
