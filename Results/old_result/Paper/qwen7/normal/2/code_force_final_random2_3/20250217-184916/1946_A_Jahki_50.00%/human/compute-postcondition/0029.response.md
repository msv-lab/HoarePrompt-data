Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of `b`, and `median` must be greater than `b[ma]`.**

Explanation: The code `new_median = b[ma]` updates the value of `new_median` to be equal to the value of `b[ma]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
