Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by generating a random permutation of the input string `s` and checking if it is different from the original string. If the permutation is different, it prints 'Yes' followed by the permutation; otherwise, it prints 'No'. 

This approach is generally correct because:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and number of test cases.
2. It generates a random permutation of the string `s` using `random.sample`.
3. It checks if the generated permutation is different from the original string.
4. It prints the appropriate response ('Yes' followed by the permutation or 'No') for each test case.

However, there is a potential issue with the program:
- The program does not guarantee that a different permutation will always be found. In some cases, especially when the string consists of repeated characters (like "aaaaa"), the random permutation might end up being the same as the original string due to the nature of random sampling.

Despite this, the problem statement allows for multiple possible answers and mentions that the program can output "YES" and "NO" in any case. Therefore, the program's logic is valid under these conditions.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program should work correctly for the given examples and the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
