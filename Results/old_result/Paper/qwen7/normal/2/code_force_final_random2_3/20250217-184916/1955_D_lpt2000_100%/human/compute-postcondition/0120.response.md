Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged if `D[out_aa] > 0` and `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `pairs_in_D += 1` increments the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. Since `D[in_aa]` was already incremented by 1 before this line, it remains unchanged. The conditions for `D[out_aa]` and `C[out_aa]` remain the same as they were not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.
