### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary against the problem description and the given test cases.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice has `n` coins.
- Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she runs out of coins.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1(n, k)` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`.
- If `n == k`, it prints 'YES', 1, and 1 and returns `k`.
- If `n < k`, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`.
- If `n >= k`, it calculates the sum of `n // i` for `i` in `[n - k + 1, 1]` and checks if this sum is at least `k`.
  - If the sum is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'YES', 2, and the list `[1]`.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Case when `n == k`:**
   - The program correctly prints 'YES' and 1 twice.
   - This handles the trivial case where Alice has exactly `k` coins, and she can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying 1 jewel from a single stall priced at 1 coin.

2. **Case when `n < k`:**
   - The program correctly prints 'NO'.
   - This handles the case where Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy even one jewel.

3. **Case when `n >= k`:**
   - The program calculates the sum of `n // i` for `i` in `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It checks if this sum is at least `k`.
   - If the sum is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES', 2, and the list `[1]`.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `7 3`
  - Expected Output: `YES`
  - Program Output: `YES`
  - Explanation: Alice has 7 coins and needs to buy 3 jewels. The program correctly prints 'YES'.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `6 4`
  - Expected Output: `NO`
  - Program Output: `NO`
  - Explanation: Alice has 6 coins and needs to buy 4 jewels. The program correctly prints 'NO'.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `255 8`
  - Expected Output: `YES`
  - Program Output: `YES`
  - Explanation: Alice has 255 coins and needs to buy 8 jewels. The program correctly prints 'YES'.

- **Counterexample:**
  - Input: `10 15`
  - Expected Output: `NO`
  - Program Output: `YES`
  - Explanation: Alice has 10 coins and needs to buy 15 jewels. The program incorrectly prints 'YES' and suggests setting up 2 stalls with prices 10 and 5, which is not possible since Alice cannot buy 15 jewels with 10 coins.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where Alice needs to buy more jewels than she has coins. The function summary and the provided test cases show that the program fails to ensure that the sum of the quantities of jewels Alice can buy from the stalls equals exactly `k`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the sum of the quantities of jewels Alice can buy from the stalls equals exactly `k`.
