Output State: **`palka` contains all elements except the first one, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, and `pl` now contains the element `i`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `pl`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
