### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This is evident from the loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters (`ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B').

3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the characters, the program compares the counts and prints the character that appears more frequently. If there is a tie (i.e., `ac` equals `bc`), the program will still print one of the characters, but according to the problem statement, this is acceptable since it specifies "denoting the character that appears most frequently in the string."

4. **Loop Logic**: The loop logic is sound and ensures that for each test case, the correct character ('A' or 'B') is printed based on its frequency.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, printing either 'A' or 'B' as specified.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
