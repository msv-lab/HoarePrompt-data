### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can conduct `m` rounds, each requiring one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   
2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of upcoming rounds).
   - It also reads a string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes a list `count` of size 7 to represent the counts of difficulties 'A' to 'G'.
   - It iterates over the string `a`, updating the count of each difficulty level.
   - It then calculates how many more problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
   - Finally, it sums up the required additional problems for all difficulty levels.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the number of problems in the bank might be less than the required number of problems for `m` rounds.
   - It correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level.

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It correctly states that the function calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed, based on the counts of each difficulty level in the string `a`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to ensure that `m` rounds can be conducted.
