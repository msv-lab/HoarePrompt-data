Output State: **`t` is either `b // 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the input `a`, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer and assigns it back to `a`. The other variables (`t`, `t1`, `n`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
