Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for \( k \) excursions, where the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time they are chosen during an excursion.

2. **Key Components**:
   - \( n \): Number of children.
   - \( m \): Number of pairs of friends.
   - \( k \): Number of excursions.
   - \( a_i, b_i, f_i \): Indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value.

3. **Core Calculation**:
   - The expected value for each pair of friends being chosen in one excursion is \( \frac{2k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - Since the friendship value increases by 1 each time a pair is chosen, the expected increase in friendship value for each pair is \( \frac{2k(k-1)}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - Summing up the contributions from all pairs, the formula used in the code is derived from these expectations.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the sum of all friendship values (`sum_f`).
   - It computes the combination \( \binom{n}{2} \) (denoted as `cn2`).
   - It uses the formula \( p = 2k \cdot cn2 \cdot sum_f + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1) \) and \( q = 2 \cdot cn2^2 \).
   - It simplifies the fraction by dividing both \( p \) and \( q \) by their greatest common divisor.
   - Finally, it computes the modular multiplicative inverse of \( q \) modulo \( M \) and multiplies it by \( p \).

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required constraints and handles large numbers efficiently.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as no friends (\( m = 0 \)) and large inputs as specified in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
