Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value, and `final` is sorted; `final` now includes the element `n`, `c1` is less than 50.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was already sorted and contained elements with the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value, appending `n` maintains the sorted order. The other variables remain unchanged.
