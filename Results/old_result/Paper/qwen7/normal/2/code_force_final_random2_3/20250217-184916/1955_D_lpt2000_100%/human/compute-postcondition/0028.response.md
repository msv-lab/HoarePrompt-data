Postcondition: `aa` is a list such that `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least one element. `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 (so it is now less than or equal to the previous value minus 1), `E[out_aa]` is greater than its previous value minus 1 (so it is now less than or equal to the previous value minus 1), and `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged.
