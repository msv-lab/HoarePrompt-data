Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even, and returns information based on these values.**

This means the function `func_2` does not take any parameters explicitly defined within its parameter list. Instead, it presumably reads `t` (the number of test cases) from an external source, then for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It checks if `k` is within the specified range and even, and then returns some form of information based on these values.
