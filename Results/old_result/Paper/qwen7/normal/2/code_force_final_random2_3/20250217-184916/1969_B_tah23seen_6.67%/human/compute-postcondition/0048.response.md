Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `left` is 6
   - `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`
   - `cost` is `right - 4`
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s`
   - The length of `s` must be at least 2
   - `s[1]` must not be '1'
   - `s[4]` must not be '1'
   - No character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0'
   - `s[right]` must be '0'
   - `s[5]` must not be '1'

3. **Determine which conditions need to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to continue, both `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'` must be true.
   - Given `left` is 6, we need to ensure that `left < len(s)` and `s[6] != '1'` for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `left` should be incremented to 7 (or higher) to satisfy `left < len(s)`.
   - `s[6]` should not be '1' to satisfy `s[left] != '1'`.

Since `left` is the only variable directly involved in the loop condition that can be adjusted, and given that `len(s)` is already determined by `right`, we need to ensure that `left` is incremented and `s[6]` is not '1'.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- Increment `left` to 7 (or higher).
- Ensure `s[6]` is not '1'.

State: **`left` is 7, `s[6]` is not '1'**
