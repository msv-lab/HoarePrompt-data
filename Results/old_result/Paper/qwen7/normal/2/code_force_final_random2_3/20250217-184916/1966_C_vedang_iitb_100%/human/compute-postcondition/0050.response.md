Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `sz` will be the last element of the list `a`. `a` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order. If any element `sz` in the list `a` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is increased by 1 for each such occurrence. The final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.

This means that `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that does not appear in the sorted list `a`.
