Output State: **`m` must be at least 4, input() function waits for user input.**

The `input()` function is called but no value is assigned to any variable, so the initial condition for `m` remains unchanged. The `input()` function itself does not assign a value to a variable; instead, it waits for user input, which is stored as a string by default unless explicitly converted. Since no assignment is made, the value of `m` stays as "must be at least 4" and the `input()` function is left waiting for user input.
