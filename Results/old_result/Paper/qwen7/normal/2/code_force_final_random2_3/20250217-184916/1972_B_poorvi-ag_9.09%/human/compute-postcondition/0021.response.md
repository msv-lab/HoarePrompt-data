Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, and `arr` is updated to the new input string.**

In this step, the code `arr = input()` takes a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
