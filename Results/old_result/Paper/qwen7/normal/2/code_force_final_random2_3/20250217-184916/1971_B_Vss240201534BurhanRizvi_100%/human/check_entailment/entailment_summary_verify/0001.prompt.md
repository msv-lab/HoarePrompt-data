You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` can be transformed into a new string `s2` that meets certain criteria. If `s` can be transformed, it prints 'Yes' followed by the transformed string `s2`; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function ensures that after processing all test cases, each string `s` either meets the "Yes" condition or remains unchanged based on the initial input constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the length of `s` is 1, the program prints 'No', which is correct because there are no other characters to rearrange.
   - If all characters in `s` are the same (e.g., 'aaaaa'), the program also prints 'No' because no rearrangement can produce a different string.

3. **General Case:**
   - For strings with more than one unique character, the program uses `random.sample` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`.
   - If the generated permutation `s2` is the same as `s`, it tries to create a different permutation by rotating the string (i.e., moving the first character to the end).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' followed by the generated permutation `s2`.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Edge Cases:**
  - Single-character strings are handled correctly.
  - Strings with all identical characters are handled correctly.

- **General Case:**
  - The use of `random.sample` ensures that the generated permutation is different from the original string `s` with high probability.
  - The rotation method (`s[1:] + s[0]`) is a simple way to ensure a different string when `s2` is the same as `s`.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program processes each test case independently, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all edge cases and general cases as per the problem description. It ensures that if a different string can be formed, it does so; otherwise, it reports that it's impossible.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
