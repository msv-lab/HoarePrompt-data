Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).

3. **Determine the Initial State Adjustments:**
   - The initial state given is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value within this range.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop depends on the input from `int(input())`, the state must include the condition that the input will be a valid integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input will be a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the input from `int(input())` must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
