Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 26` or `lex - 52`, depending on the initial value of `lex`; `arr` now contains the elements [26, 1] or [26, 26]**.

Explanation: The code `lex = lex - 26` subtracts 26 from the current value of `lex`. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, the new value of `lex` will be either `lex - 1 - 26` (if initially `lex` was `lex - 1`) or `lex - 26 - 26` (if initially `lex` was `lex - 26`). The value of `j` remains unchanged, and the value of `arr` is updated to [26, 1] or [26, 26] based on the initial value of `lex`.
