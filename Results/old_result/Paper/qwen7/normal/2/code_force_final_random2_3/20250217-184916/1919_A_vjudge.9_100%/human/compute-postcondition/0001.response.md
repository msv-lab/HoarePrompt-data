Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
   - `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\).
   - `t` is an integer input from the user.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `t` is an integer input from the user, its value is unknown initially but it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variables `a` and `b` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
