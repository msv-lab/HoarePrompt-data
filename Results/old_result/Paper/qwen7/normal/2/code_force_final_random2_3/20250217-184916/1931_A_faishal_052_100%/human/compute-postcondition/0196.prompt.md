You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will range from 0 to `cases-1`, meaning it will take on every integer value within that range exactly once. `cases` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\). The variable `arr` will contain a list of integers where each list represents the processed values of `lex` for a particular test case, with `lex` being reduced by either 2, 26, or 52 based on the conditions specified in the loop. Each `arr` list will be sorted. The variable `lex` will hold the final value after processing for each test case, which is appended to `arr`. The `info` list will contain all the `arr` lists generated for each test case, sorted as per the loop's operation.
    #
    #In summary, `info` will be a list of lists, where each inner list represents the processed values of `lex` for a specific test case, sorted according to the operations performed in the loop.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: Output State: `temp` is 'aamo', `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `cases` is 3.
    #
    #Explanation: After analyzing the loop and the given states, we can conclude that the loop runs exactly 3 times. The variable `i` remains at 4 because it is not incremented within the loop body. The variable `j` reaches 3 after 3 iterations. The variable `temp` concatenates characters derived from `info[i][j] + 96`, resulting in the string 'aamo'. Since the loop runs exactly 3 times, `cases` must be 3, and there are no further iterations to consider. Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is `temp` being 'aamo', `i` remaining 4, `j` at 3, and `cases` being 3.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, but these integers are not passed directly to the function. Instead, the function returns based on the conditions provided for `t` and `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
