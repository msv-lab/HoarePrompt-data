Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `i` is 3, and `v` is added to the list `tree`. If `v` equals the last element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the right end of `tree`. Otherwise, if `u` equals the first element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the left end of `tree`; otherwise, `v` is added to the right end of `tree`.
