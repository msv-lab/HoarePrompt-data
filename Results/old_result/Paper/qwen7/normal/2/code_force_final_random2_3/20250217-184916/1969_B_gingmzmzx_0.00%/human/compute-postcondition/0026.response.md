Postcondition: `ans` is 3 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `2 + (zeroes - 1)`. `cnt[1]` is increased by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0. `zeroes` is updated based on the new value of `c`. `s` must have at least two elements, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, and `s` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.
