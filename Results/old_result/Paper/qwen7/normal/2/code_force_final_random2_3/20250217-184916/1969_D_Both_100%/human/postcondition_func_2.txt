The function accepts a list of tuples `primary_items` and a list of integers `secondary_heap`. It calculates the total by adding the initial sum of values in `secondary_heap` to the sum of `item[0] + item[1]` for every tuple in `primary_items` where `item[0] + item[1]` is non-negative. The function then returns this total.
