Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(cases)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `cases`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `arr` contains [26, 26, 'lex']
   - `lex` is an integer (though its value is not relevant for the loop)
   - `j` is 2
   - `i` is 100

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `cases`. Since `i` is currently 100, `cases` must be greater than 100 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state such that the loop can potentially execute again. This means updating `i` to be 101 (or any number less than `cases`) and ensuring `cases` is greater than 100.

Given these points, the updated state should be:

State: **`arr` contains [26, 26, 'lex'], `lex` is an integer, `j` is 2, `i` is 101, `cases` must be greater than 100**
