Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equal to the last digit of `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digit of `arr[i]`, and `ans` is False.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` sets the variable `ans` to `False`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the conditions and values of `m`, `i`, `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]`, `nums`, and the relationship between these variables remain unchanged.
