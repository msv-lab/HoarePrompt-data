Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` plus 1 equals `n` minus 1, and in this case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; `idx2` is equal to `i`, `p2` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `p2` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `n`, `i`, `idx2`, and the condition related to the loop or if statement remain unchanged from the initial state.
