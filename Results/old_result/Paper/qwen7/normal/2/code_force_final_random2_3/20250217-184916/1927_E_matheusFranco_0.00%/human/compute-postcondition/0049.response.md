Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)' and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is replaced by `curr_v`, `curr_v` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must still be less than `len(permutation)' and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is still replaced by `curr_v`, which now has the value of its previous value plus 1.
