Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is 50001**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, `(L + R)` equals 100002. Dividing 100002 by 2 gives 50001. All other variables (`L`, `R`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `x` is updated to 50001 while the other variables retain their original values.
