Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `length` is 30.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is set to 1, then the list `s` contains '1'. Otherwise, `s` contains '0'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < 30`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the previous iteration, `i` would be 0.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < 30`.
   - With `i` being 1, the condition `i < 30` is still true.

6. **Adjust the state of the variables**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `length` remains unchanged at 30.
   - The list `s` will be updated based on the new value of `i`. Specifically, the first element of `s` (since `i` is now 1) will be checked against the first bit of `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, and if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set to 1, then the list `s` contains '1' at index 0. Otherwise, `s` contains '0' at index 0**.
