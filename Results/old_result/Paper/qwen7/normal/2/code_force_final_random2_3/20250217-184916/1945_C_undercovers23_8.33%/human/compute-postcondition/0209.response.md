Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `n // 2`, `zero` is 3, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 60.0, `one_perc` is 100, and `lst` contains `[2]`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2, `zero` is either 2 or 1, and `one` is either 2 or 1. Given that `s[i]` is '0' (since `i` is 2 and the initial condition implies `s[2]` should be '0'), `zero` is incremented by 1, making `zero` equal to 3. The line `zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` calculates the percentage of zeros encountered up to index `i`. With `zero` being 3 and `i` being 2, the calculation is `math.ceil(3 * 100 / 3)`, which results in `60.0`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
