### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the program and provides a thorough analysis. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) using a nested loop.
   - The outer loop runs from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\) to ensure efficient coverage of all possible values of \(x\).
   - The inner loop runs from 1 to a value where \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\), ensuring that the bounds are respected.
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - If both conditions are met, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It ensures that the program processes all test cases correctly.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - The original assessment correctly verifies the logic with the provided examples, showing that the program produces the expected results.

5. **Detailed Loop Analysis**:
   - The outer loop ensures that \(x\) is efficiently covered up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - The inner loop ensures that \(y\) is within the bounds defined by \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The GCD check ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is necessary for the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The count calculation correctly increments the count based on the valid pairs found.

Given the detailed analysis and the correct implementation of the logic, the original assessment accurately describes the behavior and correctness of the program.
