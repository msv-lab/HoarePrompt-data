Output State: **`sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `i` is within the range `[0, k-1]`, `sum1` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` now includes the new value of `sums`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**

This means that the value of `sums` has been added to the list `ans`. The other variables (`sum1`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
