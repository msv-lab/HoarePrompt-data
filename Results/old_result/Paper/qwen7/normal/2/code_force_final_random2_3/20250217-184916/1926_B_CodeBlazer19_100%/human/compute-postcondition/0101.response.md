Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is either an empty string, 'SQUARE', or 'TRIANGLE', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n-2`, `s` is the input string provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. No other variables are affected. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
