Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the final input string provided, and if `a` is not 0, the program does not change any variables. If `a` is 0, the program does not change any variables either.
