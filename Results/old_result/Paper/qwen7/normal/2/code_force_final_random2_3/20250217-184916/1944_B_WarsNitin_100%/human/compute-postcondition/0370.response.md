Output State: `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `k` is `-n`, `ans1` contains all elements from `l`, and `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from the list `c` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will have incremented to `2 * n - 1` since it starts from `n` and increments by 1 in each iteration until `k` becomes 0. At this point, `k` will be `-n` because it starts at `2 * k` (which is `2 * n` initially) and decreases by 1 with each iteration. `ans1` will contain all elements from `l` as the loop continues to add elements from `l` until `k` becomes 0. `ans2` will contain pairs of consecutive equal elements from the list `c` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, unless `k` becomes 0 before reaching the end of the list.
