Output State: **`password` is the remaining substring of the original `password` after removing the first character, `char` is the second character of the original `password`, `letters` contains the second character of the original `password`, and `digits` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `letters.append(char)` appends the `char` (which is the second character of the original `password`) to the `letters` list. The `password` is updated to be the remaining substring of the original `password` after removing the first character. The value of `digits` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
