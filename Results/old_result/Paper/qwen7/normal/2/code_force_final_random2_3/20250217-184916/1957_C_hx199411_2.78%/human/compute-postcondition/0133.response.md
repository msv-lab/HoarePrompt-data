Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`. The loop will start from `3` and go up to `m + 1`.

2. **Initial State of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `k`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will start executing if `i` is in the range from `3` to `m + 1`. This means `i` must be at least `3` for the loop to start.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `k`, we need to ensure that `k` is at least `3` for the loop to start.
   - No other variables (`dp`, `num`, `c`, `r`) are directly involved in the loop condition, so they don't need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` (which is `k`), ensuring that `k` is at least `3`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` (which is `k`) must be at least 3**
