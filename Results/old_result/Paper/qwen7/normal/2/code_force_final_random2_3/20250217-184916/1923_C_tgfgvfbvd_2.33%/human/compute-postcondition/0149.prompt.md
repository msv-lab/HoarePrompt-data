Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    c = 0
    for x in l:
        c += x
        p.append(c)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        s = p[b - 1]
        if a - 2 >= 0:
            s -= p[a - 2]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `a` and `b` are the integers from the last input split, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the last input integers provided during the loop's execution, `m` is the final value it took after all iterations, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` with the final adjustments made during each iteration of the loop. The value of `m` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed. After all iterations, if the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))` is met, the program will print 'YES' for the last iteration; otherwise, it will print 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `c` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, and `p` will be a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
