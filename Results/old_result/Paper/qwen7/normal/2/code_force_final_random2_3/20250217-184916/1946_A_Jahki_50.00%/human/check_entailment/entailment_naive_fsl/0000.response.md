Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the median is already the maximum value in the array. Here's an example to demonstrate this issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
5
5 5 5 4 5
```

According to the problem description, the median of the array `[5, 5, 5, 4, 5]` is `5`. Since `5` is already the maximum value in the array, no operations are needed to increase the median. However, the program will increment elements until it finds a value greater than `5`, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

To fix this, the program should check if the current median is the maximum value in the array and return `0` in such cases. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input()
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
        median = b[ma]
        max_val = max(b)
        if median == max_val:
            print(0)
        else:
            new_median = median
            op = 0
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the median is already the maximum value and returns `0` in that case, ensuring the program works correctly for all potential cases.
