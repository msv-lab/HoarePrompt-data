Output State: **`sz` is the first element of the list `a`, `a` is a non-empty list of sorted integers, `mexsize` is `sz` + 1**.

Explanation: The code increments `mexsize` by 1. Since `sz` was previously equal to `mexsize`, after the increment, `mexsize` becomes `sz` + 1. The other variables (`sz` and the list `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
