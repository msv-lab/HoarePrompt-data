Reasoning:
The given program attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the condition that if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the optimal strategy of the players.

According to the game rules:
1. Players can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
2. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

Let's analyze the game more deeply:
- If Alice and Bob both have the same number of coins, the game is symmetric. Each move by Alice can be mirrored by Bob, leading to a situation where the player who starts (Alice) will eventually lose because she will be forced to make the last move when both wallets are empty.
- If Alice and Bob have different numbers of coins, the player with fewer coins can always swap wallets to equalize the number of coins, forcing the other player into a losing position.

Given these observations, the correct logic should be:
- If \(a\) and \(b\) are equal, Bob wins because Alice will eventually be forced to make the last move.
- If \(a\) and \(b\) are not equal, Alice wins because she can always swap wallets to make the numbers equal, forcing Bob into a losing position.

The provided program incorrectly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference. Therefore, the given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game.

Correctness: **False**
