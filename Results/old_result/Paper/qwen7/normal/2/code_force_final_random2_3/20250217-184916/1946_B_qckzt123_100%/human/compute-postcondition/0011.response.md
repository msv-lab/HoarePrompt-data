Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = 0` sets the variable `tmp` to 0. This changes the initial state where `tmp` was less than 0 to now being exactly 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
