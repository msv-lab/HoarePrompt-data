Given the initial state, let's break down the expression to determine what will be printed:

1. `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
2. `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from input, with `b > a`.
3. `k` is defined as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

The expression to be evaluated is:
\[ b \times k - k \times (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) \times a \]

Let's analyze this expression step-by-step:

- `b \times k`: This multiplies `b` by `k`.
- `k \times (k - 1) // 2`: This calculates the sum of the first `k-1` integers, which is a triangular number.
- `(n - k) \times a`: This multiplies `a` by the difference between `n` and `k`.

Combining these parts, the expression represents a calculation involving `b`, `k`, and `a`, adjusted by the triangular number sequence.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical result. However, we can describe the expression in terms of the variables.

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a**
