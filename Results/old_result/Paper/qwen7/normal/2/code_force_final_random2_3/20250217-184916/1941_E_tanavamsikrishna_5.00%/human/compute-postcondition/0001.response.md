Output State: **`rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers inputted separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` lines of input, each containing `m` space-separated integers, and assigns these integers to the corresponding positions in the `rows` list. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial state, as they are not used within the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `rows` list and the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
