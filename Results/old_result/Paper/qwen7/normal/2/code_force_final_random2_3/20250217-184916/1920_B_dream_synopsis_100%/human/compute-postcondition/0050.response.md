Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a` in place. This means that the order of elements in `a` is flipped. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
