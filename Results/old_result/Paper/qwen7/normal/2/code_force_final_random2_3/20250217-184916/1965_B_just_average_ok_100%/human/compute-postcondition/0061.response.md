Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 20, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], the current value of `nums[idx]` is less than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no explicit loop or conditional block indicated in the code snippet, the only effect is that the execution will exit the context where the `break` statement is placed, which is implied to be the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial or previously stated values.
