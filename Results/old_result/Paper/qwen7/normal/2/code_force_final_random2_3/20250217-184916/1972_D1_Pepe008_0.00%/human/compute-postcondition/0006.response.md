Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial values or conditions for these variables**:
   - `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `b`.
   - `b` is derived from `info[1]`, which is an integer value.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.
   - For the loop to start, `b` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts from 1).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `b` is derived from `info[1]`, we need to ensure that `b` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0, but it will be set to 1 when the loop starts.

Given the initial states:
- `T` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is 0.
- `a` is `int(info[0])`.
- `b` is `int(info[1])`.
- `suma` is 0.

We need to ensure that `b` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we adjust the state to reflect this requirement.

**Final State**:
State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1**
