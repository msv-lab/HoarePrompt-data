Output State: **`c` is increased by `x_next` + `x` + `x`, `l` must have at least two elements, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` + [c]**.

Explanation: The initial state had `c` being increased by `x_next` + `x`. After executing `c += x`, `c` is further increased by `x`. Therefore, the new value of `c` is `x_next + x + x`. The conditions for `l` and the definition of `p` remain unchanged.
