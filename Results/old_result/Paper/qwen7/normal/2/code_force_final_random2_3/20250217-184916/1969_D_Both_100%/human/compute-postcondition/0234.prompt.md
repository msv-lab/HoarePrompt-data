Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ price_i ≤ 10^9, and `bonuses` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ bonus_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    heap = []
    remaining_items = []
    n, k = func_2()
    prices = list(func_2())
    neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
    bonuses = list(func_2())
    max_profit = 0
    current_profit = 0
    combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
    combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
    for _ in range(k):
        if combined:
            heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
    if combined:
        current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit
    while combined:
        item = combined.pop()
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            current_profit -= item[1]
        else:
            current_profit += item[0]
        removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
        if removed_item:
            current_profit -= removed_item[0]
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
    print(max_profit)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `combined` will be empty, `heap` will contain the `k` smallest elements from the original `combined` list, `k` will be 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, and all other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute until `combined` is empty. During each iteration, it processes one item from `combined`. Depending on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, the `current_profit` is either decreased by `item[1]` or increased by `item[0]`. The item is then pushed into and popped from the `heap`, potentially updating `current_profit` further. If `current_profit` exceeds `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated. Once `combined` is exhausted, the loop terminates, leaving `combined` empty, `heap` containing the `k` smallest elements from the original `combined` list, `k` reset to 0, `current_profit` reflecting the final profit calculated by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `max_profit` set to this final profit. All other variables retain their initial states.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `heap` will have had its second smallest element replaced multiple times until `combined` is empty. The final state of `max_profit` will be the highest `current_profit` value encountered during the loop's execution, ensuring it is always non-decreasing. `current_profit` will reflect the net profit calculated based on the operations performed within the loop, considering both positive and negative adjustments. `combined` will be an empty list, as all items will have been processed. `removed_item` will be True for each iteration where the operation `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` was executed, meaning the second smallest element in `heap` was replaced by `item` in each iteration. The exact values of `current_profit` and `max_profit` will depend on the specific sequence of items processed and their respective values, but `max_profit` will be the maximum value of `current_profit` observed throughout the loop's execution.

In summary, `combined` is empty, `heap` has had its second smallest element replaced iteratively, `max_profit` is the highest `current_profit` seen during the loop, and `current_profit` reflects the cumulative net profit adjustment.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `combined` will be an empty list because the loop continues as long as `combined` is not empty. `heap` will contain up to `k` elements, which are the smallest elements from the `combined` list after all items have been processed and replaced according to the conditions in the loop. `current_profit` will be the final profit calculated after considering all items in `combined` and adjusting it based on the rules defined in the loop. `max_profit` will hold the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during the entire execution of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `combined` will be empty, `heap` will contain up to `k` smallest elements from the original `combined` list (or fewer if there weren't enough elements), `current_profit` will reflect the final profit calculation, and `max_profit` will be the highest profit achieved throughout the process.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
