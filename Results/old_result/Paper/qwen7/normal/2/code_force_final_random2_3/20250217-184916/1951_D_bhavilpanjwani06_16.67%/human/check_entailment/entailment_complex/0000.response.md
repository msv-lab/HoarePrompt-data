Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: \( n < k \)**: In this case, Alice does not have enough coins to buy even one jewel, so it is impossible for her to buy exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the program prints "NO".
   - **Case 2: \( n = k \)**: In this case, Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels she needs to buy. She can buy one jewel from one stall and be left with no coins. Therefore, the program prints "YES", 1, and `n`.
   - **Case 3: \( n > k \)**:
     - **Subcase 3.1: \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \)**: In this subcase, Alice can buy one jewel from the first \( k-1 \) stalls and use the remaining coins to buy one jewel from the last stall. Therefore, the program prints "YES", 2, and the appropriate prices for the stalls.
     - **Subcase 3.2: \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \)**: In this subcase, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels because the required number of stalls exceeds the available coins. Therefore, the program prints "NO".

The annotated program correctly handles all these cases and prints the appropriate responses. The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
