Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of `l` appended with the element at index 1 of `l`, and `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 1, `ans1` now contains the elements at indices 0 and 1 of `l`. The value of `ans2` remains unchanged as it was only initialized to the element at index 1 of `l`. The value of `i` also remains unchanged.
