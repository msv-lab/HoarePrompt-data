Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered by the user as a string, and `results` list contains 'yes' if the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`, and 'no' otherwise; `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`**.

In this output state, the value of `n` is updated to the integer input by the user, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
