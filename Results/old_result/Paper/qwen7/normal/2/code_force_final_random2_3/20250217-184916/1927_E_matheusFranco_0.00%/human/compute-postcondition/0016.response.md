Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated to ensure it is less than `len(permutation) - k` and then incremented by `k`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`; `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`.**

This means that the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been adjusted to be less than `len(permutation) - k` and then incremented by `k`. After that, the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` has been set to `curr_v`, and `curr_v` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain in their initial state relative to the precondition.
