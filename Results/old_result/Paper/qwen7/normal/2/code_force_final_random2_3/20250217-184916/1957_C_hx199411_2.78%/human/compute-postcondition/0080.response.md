Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `k`.
- `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted by the user during the loop's final iteration.
- `num` is the sum of 2 added for each pair of inputs where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`.
- `m` is calculated as `n - num`. The current value of `m` is 1.

The print statement is `print(1)`. This statement directly prints the integer 1, regardless of the values of other variables like `c`, `r`, `num`, and `m`.

Output: **1**
