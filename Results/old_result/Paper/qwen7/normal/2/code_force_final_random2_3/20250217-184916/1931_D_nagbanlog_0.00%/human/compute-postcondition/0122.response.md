Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`; otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. If the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the dictionary `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. If the tuple does not exist, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1.
