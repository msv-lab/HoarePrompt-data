Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`, `s` is updated to the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the updated string `s`. If the string `s` contains '11', the program does not change the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.**
