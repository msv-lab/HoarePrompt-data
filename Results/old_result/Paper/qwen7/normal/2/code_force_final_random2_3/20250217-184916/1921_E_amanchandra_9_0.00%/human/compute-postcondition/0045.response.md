Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases provided as input. For each iteration, the values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, and `yb` will be updated based on the input for that specific test case. The variables `l` and `r` will retain their final values determined during the last iteration of the loop for each respective test case. If `xa > xb`, the output for that test case will always be 'Draw'. Otherwise, the output will be 'Alice' if both conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` are met, or 'Bob' if the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x` are met. All other variables outside the loop, such as `t`, will remain unchanged from their initial state.

In summary, the output state will include the total number of iterations (`i`), the final values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, and `yb` for each test case, and the corresponding outputs ('Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob') for each test case, with `l` and `r` holding their last computed values within each test case's context.
