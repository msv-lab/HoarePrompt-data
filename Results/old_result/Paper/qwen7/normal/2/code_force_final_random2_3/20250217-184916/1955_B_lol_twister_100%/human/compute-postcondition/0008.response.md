Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `h`, and the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 0
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive
   - `h` is 1
   - `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * 1` and the appended value `a + k * c + d * h`

3. **Determine the next value of `h`**: Since `h` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `h` was `1`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `h` will be `2`.

4. **Adjust the list `li`**: 
   - The initial list `li` contains `a + k * c + d * 1` and `a + k * c + d * h`. Since `h` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, the list currently contains `a + k * c + d * 1` and `a + k * c + d * 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `h` will be `2`, so the list will append `a + k * c + d * 2`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `k` remains `0` because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `h` will be `2`.
   - `li` will now contain `a + k * c + d * 1`, `a + k * c + d * 1`, and `a + k * c + d * 2`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 2, `li` is a list containing the values `a + k * c + d * 1`, `a + k * c + d * 1`, and `a + k * c + d * 2`**.
