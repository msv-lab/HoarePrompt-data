Postcondition: `i` is `m-3`, `m` remains greater than 1, `arr[i-1]` is updated based on the comparison of `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]`, and `ans` is `False`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, then `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last character of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, and `arr[i-1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.
