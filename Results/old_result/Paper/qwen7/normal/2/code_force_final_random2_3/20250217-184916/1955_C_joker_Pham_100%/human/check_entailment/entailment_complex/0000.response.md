Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and calls the `func_1` function with the appropriate arguments.
2. The `func_1` function logic is designed to simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships, reducing their durability and counting the number of sunk ships.
3. The function uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the first and last ships, respectively.
4. It iterates through the ships, reducing their durability based on the number of attacks `k` and updating the count of sunk ships.
5. The function handles the special case where the durability of the ship at either end becomes zero, reducing the effective size of the list `a`.
6. The function correctly breaks the loop when there are no more attacks left or when the remaining ships cannot be sunk with the remaining attacks.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the function appears to accurately simulate the Kraken's attacks and count the number of sunk ships.

Correctness: **True**
