Output State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 0, `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * h`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given the initial state where `k` is 0 and `h` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a + 0 * c + 0 * h`, which further simplifies to just `a`. Therefore, `li` now contains the value `a`. The values of `k`, `n`, and `h` remain unchanged.
