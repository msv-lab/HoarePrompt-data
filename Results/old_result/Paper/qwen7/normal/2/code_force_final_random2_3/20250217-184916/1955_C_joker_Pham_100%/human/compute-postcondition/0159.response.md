Output State: **`sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is an integer and equals `k - a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]` if `a[l]` was not 0, and `l` is increased by 1 if `a[l]` was equal to 0; `r` is decremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `r` is reduced by 1. The other variables (`sunks`, `k`, `a[l]`, and `l`) remain in the same state as described in the initial state, with the condition that `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]` if `a[l]` was not 0, and `l` is increased by 1 if `a[l]` was equal to 0.
