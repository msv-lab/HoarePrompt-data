Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. The variables involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `x` is the variable that will take on each element of the list `a` during each iteration.
   - `a` is the list of integers.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. 

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `x` will take on the values from the list `a`, we don't need to explicitly set its initial value. We just need to ensure that the list `a` has at least one element.
   - The list `a` is already defined as a list of integers read from input, so we need to ensure it has at least one element.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are related to the list `a`. Specifically, `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`**
