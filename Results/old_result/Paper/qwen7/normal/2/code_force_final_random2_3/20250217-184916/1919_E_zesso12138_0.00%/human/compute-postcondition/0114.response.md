Output State: **`dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element `dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) is the sum of all previous `new_dp[j]` values (where `new_dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code `dp = new_dp` assigns the value of `new_dp` to `dp`. This means that `dp` now holds the same list as `new_dp`, which is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element `dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) is the sum of all previous `new_dp[j]` values (where `new_dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
