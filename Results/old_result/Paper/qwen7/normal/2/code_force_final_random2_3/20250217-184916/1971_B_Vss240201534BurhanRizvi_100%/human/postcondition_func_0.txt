The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` can be transformed into a new string `s2` that meets certain criteria. If `s` can be transformed, it prints 'Yes' followed by the transformed string `s2`; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function ensures that after processing all test cases, each string `s` either meets the "Yes" condition or remains unchanged based on the initial input constraints.
