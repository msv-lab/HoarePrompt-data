Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to minimize the penalty by splitting the array `a` (represented by the string `s`) into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length.

### Provided Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `length` and the string `expression`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes the string `expression` and its length `length`.
   - It counts the number of `+` characters in the string.
   - It calculates `sub` as the difference between the length of the string and the count of `+` characters.
   - It returns the absolute difference between `count` and `sub`.

### Detailed Reasoning
1. **Counting `+` and `-` Characters:**
   - The function correctly counts the number of `+` characters (`count`).
   - The number of `-` characters is implicitly counted as `length - count`.

2. **Calculating Penalty:**
   - The penalty calculation in the function is incorrect. The penalty should be the minimum possible value of the sum of penalties of the subarrays.
   - The current implementation simply returns `abs(sub - count)`, which does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

3. **Optimal Splitting Strategy:**
   - To minimize the penalty, we need to ensure that each subarray has a sum as close to zero as possible.
   - The optimal strategy is to split the array at every change from `+` to `-` or vice versa, because this ensures that each subarray has a minimal absolute sum.

### Correct Implementation
A correct approach would involve:
- Counting the number of `+` and `-` characters.
- Splitting the array at every change in sign.
- Calculating the penalty for each subarray and summing them up.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(min_penalty(expression, length))

def min_penalty(expression, length):
    count_plus = expression.count('+')
    count_minus = length - count_plus
    penalty = 0
    
    # Calculate the penalty for each segment
    i = 0
    while i < length:
        if expression[i] == '+':
            end = i + count_plus
        else:
            end = i + count_minus
        subarray_sum = sum(1 if expression[j] == '+' else -1 for j in range(i, end))
        penalty += abs(subarray_sum) * (end - i)
        i = end
    
    return penalty
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
