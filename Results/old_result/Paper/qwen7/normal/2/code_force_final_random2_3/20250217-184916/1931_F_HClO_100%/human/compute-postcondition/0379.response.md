Output State: **`i` is increased by 1; `idx1` is equal to `i`; `p1` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `p1`. The values of `i` and `idx1` are updated according to their previous conditions, and no other changes occur to the variables. The condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` remains within the if part of the most internal loop or if statement, but its evaluation depends on the current values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n`, which are not specified further.
