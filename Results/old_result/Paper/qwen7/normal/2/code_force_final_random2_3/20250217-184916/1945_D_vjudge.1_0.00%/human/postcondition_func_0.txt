The function accepts two lists, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, both containing `n` integers within the range 1 to \(10^9\), and two positive integers `n` and `k` where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 200,000\). It processes these inputs by comparing elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` up to index `n-k-1`, accumulating certain sums based on comparison results, and then calculates a minimum value involving these sums and the remaining elements of `lista_A`. Finally, it prints this minimum value.
