Postcondition: `i` is either 2 or remains 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is false, otherwise `k` remains unchanged. `r` is set to `a[1] + 0 // 2` if `i` is 1, otherwise `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` is `0 % 2` in both cases. `y` is `n - 2` if `i` is 1, otherwise `y` is not specified as it is not used in the else part.
