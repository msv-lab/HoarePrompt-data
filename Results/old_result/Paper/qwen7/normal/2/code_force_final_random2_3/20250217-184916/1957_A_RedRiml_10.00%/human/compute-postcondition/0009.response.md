Output State: **`palka` contains at least one element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, and the current value of `d.get(i)` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` was previously the first element in `palka` and the value of `d.get(i)` was `None`, after executing the code, the value of `d.get(i)` changes to `1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
