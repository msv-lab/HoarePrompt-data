Postcondition: `y` is `n`, and `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. If `l[x]` is less than `a` and `l[x]` is less than `b`, then `b` remains the maximum value in the list. If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.
