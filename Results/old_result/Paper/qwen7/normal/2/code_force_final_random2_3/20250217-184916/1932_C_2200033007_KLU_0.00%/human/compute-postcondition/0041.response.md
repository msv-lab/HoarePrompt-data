Output State: **The program returns a reversed list of intermediate product values calculated during the loop, starting from the product of all elements in the reversed list `b` down to the product of the first element of `b`.**

To break this down:
- We start with a list `b` and calculate the product of all its elements in reverse order.
- For each iteration of the loop, we store the current product value in the list `ans`.
- After completing the loop, we reverse the list `ans` to get the final output.
- The final output is a list containing each intermediate product value from the last element's product to the first element's product of the reversed list `b`.
