You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of six positive integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b such that 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b, and the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <=
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases provided as input. For each iteration, the values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, and `yb` will be updated based on the input for that specific test case. The variables `l` and `r` will retain their final values determined during the last iteration of the loop for each respective test case. If `xa > xb`, the output for that test case will always be 'Draw'. Otherwise, the output will be 'Alice' if both conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` are met, or 'Bob' if the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x` are met. All other variables outside the loop, such as `t`, will remain unchanged from their initial state.
    #
    #In summary, the output state will include the total number of iterations (`i`), the final values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, and `yb` for each test case, and the corresponding outputs ('Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob') for each test case, with `l` and `r` holding their last computed values within each test case's context.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of six positive integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for these integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
