Postcondition: `i` is 28, `u` is 1, `v` is either odd or even (but not 0), `op` is the final result of the XOR operation over the i-th bit of each element in `a`, `cnt` is the total number of times `op` became `False` during the loop execution, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
