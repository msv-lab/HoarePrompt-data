Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes four inputs: numero_testes (an integer), n and m (integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), a (a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and b (a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value details are not provided in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
