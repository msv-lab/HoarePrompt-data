Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, and `results` list is ['no', 'yes'] if the count of '1' in `arr` is not exactly 2 or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and ['no', 'no'] if the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`. After executing the if-else block, if the condition `arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr` is true, `results` remains ['no', 'yes']. If the condition is false, `results` remains unchanged as ['no', 'no'].
