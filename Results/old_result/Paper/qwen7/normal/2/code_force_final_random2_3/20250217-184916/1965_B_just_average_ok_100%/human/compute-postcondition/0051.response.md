Output State: **`i` is 20, `idx` is 20, `nums` is a list with elements [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048577, 1048578] excluding 1048576.**

Explanation: The code removes the element from the list `nums` at the index specified by `idx`. Since `idx` is 20, the element `1048576` (which is the 21st element in the list, considering 0-based indexing) is removed. All other variables (`i` and `idx`) remain unchanged.
