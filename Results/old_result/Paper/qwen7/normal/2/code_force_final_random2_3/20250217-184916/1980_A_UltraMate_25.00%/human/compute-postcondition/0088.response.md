Output State: **`i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is equal to `m` plus the previous value of `ans`**.

In this case, the code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. However, since the initial value of `ans` is not specified (other than being equal to `m` plus its previous value, which is not given), we can only say that `ans` is now `ans + m`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
