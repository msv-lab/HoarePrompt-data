Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It first checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing using the `all` function with the condition `[a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)]`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' because no further operations are needed.
4. If the array is not non-decreasing, it enters a loop where it tries to find a valid split point `i` such that:
   - The subarray from index `i` to the end (`a[i:]`) is non-decreasing.
   - The first part of the array up to index `i-1` is non-increasing (i.e., `a[0] >= new[i]` for all `i` in the subarray).
   - The subarray from index `i` to the end is non-decreasing.
5. If such a split is found, it prints 'YES'.
6. If no such split is found after checking all possible points, it prints 'NO'.

Given the execution summary and the detailed reasoning above, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing through the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
