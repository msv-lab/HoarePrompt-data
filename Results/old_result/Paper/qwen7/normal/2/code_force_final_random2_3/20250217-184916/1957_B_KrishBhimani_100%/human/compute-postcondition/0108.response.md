Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is between 1 and 4 (inclusive).
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`.
   - `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `ans` has been extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` starts with two elements: `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`.
   - After initialization, `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`, meaning it will have `n` elements in total.

3. **Determining the Values:**
   - Since `i` is between 1 and 4, let's consider the possible values for `(1 << i) - 1`:
     - If `i = 1`, then `(1 << 1) - 1 = 1`.
     - If `i = 2`, then `(1 << 2) - 1 = 3`.
     - If `i = 3`, then `(1 << 3) - 1 = 7`.
     - If `i = 4`, then `(1 << 4) - 1 = 15`.
   - Let's assume `i = 2` for simplicity (the same logic applies for other values of `i`):
     - So, the first element of `ans` is `3`.
     - The second element of `ans` is `k - sum(ans)`. Initially, `sum(ans) = 3`, so the second element is `k - 3`.
     - After extending `ans` by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`, if `n = 5`, then `ans` becomes `[3, k - 3, 0, 0, 0]`.

4. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement `print(*ans)` will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the above analysis, the output will depend on the specific values of `i` and `k`. For `i = 2` and assuming `n = 5` and `k = 10` (as an example):

Output: **3 7 0 0 0**
