Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **List `ans`**: The initial state defines that the list `ans` will contain all integers from 1048576 to 1048575 * 2^19.
   - The starting number is 1048576.
   - The ending number is 1048575 * 2^19.
   - The sequence is continuous and inclusive.

2. **Calculating the Ending Number**:
   - 1048575 * 2^19 = 1048575 * 524288 = 549755813888.

3. **Length of List `ans`**:
   - The length of the list is the difference between the ending number and the starting number plus one (since both endpoints are included).
   - Length = 549755813888 - 1048576 + 1 = 549745328313.

4. **Variable `j`**: The variable `j` is explicitly stated to be 20, but it is not used in the print statement.

Given the above calculations, the print statement `print(len(ans))` will output the length of the list `ans`.

Output: **549745328313**
