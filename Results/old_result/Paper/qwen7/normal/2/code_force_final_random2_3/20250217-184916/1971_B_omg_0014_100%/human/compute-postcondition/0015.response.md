Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `s` is a string input from the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the string `s`, `b` is a string which is the sorted version of `s`, and `c` is a string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order. If `b` equals `s`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted version of `s` but not equal to `s`.**
