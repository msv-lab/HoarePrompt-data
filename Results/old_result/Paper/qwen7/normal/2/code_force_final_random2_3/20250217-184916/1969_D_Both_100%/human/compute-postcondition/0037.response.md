Postcondition: **`combined` is one item shorter, `heap` contains the `k` smallest elements from the original `combined` list excluding the last popped item, `k` remains 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, and all other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The sum of `item[0]` and `item[1]` is less than 0**
