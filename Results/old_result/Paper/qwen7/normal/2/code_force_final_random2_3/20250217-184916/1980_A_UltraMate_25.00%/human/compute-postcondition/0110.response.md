Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through constraints where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), for each test case `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and 1 and 5 (inclusive) respectively, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a value based on these inputs.**
