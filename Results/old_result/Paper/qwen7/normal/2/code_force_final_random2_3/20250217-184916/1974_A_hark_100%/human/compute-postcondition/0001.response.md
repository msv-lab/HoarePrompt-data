Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `k` and `ap`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `ap` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `k < ap`. Therefore, the initial value of `k` should be 0 (the starting point of the loop) and `ap` must be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `k` starts from 0, we don't need to change its initial value.
   - `ap` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `ap` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` must be a positive integer**
