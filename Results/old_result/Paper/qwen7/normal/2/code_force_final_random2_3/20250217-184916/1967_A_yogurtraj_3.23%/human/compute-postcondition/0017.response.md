Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is 0, `rem` is `k % 1`, `y` is `n - 1`, `k` is adjusted based on the condition: if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` then `k` remains unchanged, otherwise `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]` when `i` is 1.
