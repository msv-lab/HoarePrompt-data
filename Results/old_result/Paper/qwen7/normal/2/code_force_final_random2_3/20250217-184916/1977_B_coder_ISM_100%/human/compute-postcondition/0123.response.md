Output State: **`nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with length 31 and the last element is '1'**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. The initial state of `s` is a list with a length of 31. After appending `'1'`, the length of `s` remains 31, but the last element of the list `s` is now `'1'`. The values of `nalla`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged.
