Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `r` is the string '>', `prev` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `prev`. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `i`, `prev` simply takes on the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
