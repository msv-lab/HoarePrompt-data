Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 3, `balance` is either 1, -1, 3, or 1, `details` is a list containing three tuples where the first tuple is (1, -3, char)**

Explanation: The variable `balance` was incremented by 1, changing its value from either 0, -2, 2, or 0 to either 1, -1, 3, or 1. The variable `i` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The strings `s` and the content of the list `details` remain unchanged.
