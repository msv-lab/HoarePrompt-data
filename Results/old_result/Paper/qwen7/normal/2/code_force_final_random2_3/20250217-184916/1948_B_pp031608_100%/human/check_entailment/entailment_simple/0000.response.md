Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array followed by the array elements. This matches the problem description.

2. **Array Processing**: The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning. For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous one (`arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`). If this condition is true, it attempts to sort the digits of the previous element and check if the resulting array is still in the required order.

3. **Sorting Digits**: When the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met, the program converts the previous element into its digit form, sorts these digits, and then checks if the concatenation of these digits results in a non-decreasing sequence. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if `ans` remains `True` after processing all elements, indicating that the array can be made non-decreasing. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like arrays that are already sorted or contain zeros appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
