Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it counts the occurrences of the median value in the sorted array. This approach is incorrect because simply counting the occurrences of the current median does not guarantee that the median will increase with the minimum number of operations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2 2 8
```
- The original array is `[2, 2, 8]`.
- The median is `2` (index 1 in the sorted array `[2, 2, 8]`).
- The program outputs `1`, which is the count of `2`s in the array.

However, to increase the median, we need to make the smallest element greater than the current median. In this case, increasing the first `2` to `3` would change the array to `[3, 2, 8]`, and the new median would be `3`. This requires only **1 operation**, but the program incorrectly outputs `1` as the count of `2`s, not the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
