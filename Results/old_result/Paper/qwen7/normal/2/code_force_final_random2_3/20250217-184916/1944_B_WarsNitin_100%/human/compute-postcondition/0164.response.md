Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `k` is 0 (though `k` is not directly involved in the loop head).

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`, which is 2.
   - The condition `n > 1` remains unchanged as long as `n` does not change.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` needs to be set to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still needs to be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
