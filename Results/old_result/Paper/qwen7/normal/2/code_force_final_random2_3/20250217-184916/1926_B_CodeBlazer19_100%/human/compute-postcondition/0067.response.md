Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the new input string provided.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` assigns the value of the new input string to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `s` is updated to the new input string provided by the user.
