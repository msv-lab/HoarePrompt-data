Based on the initial state provided:

- `g` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer which is at least 2.
- `r` is the final input string after all iterations (though it's not relevant to the print statement).
- `prev` is 0.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `kp` is 1.
- `v1` is `n-1`.
- `v2` is `n-1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Let's break down the values that will be printed:

- `v1` is `n-1`.
- `i` is less than `n`, so it could be any integer from 0 to `n-1` (but its exact value is not specified).
- `v1` again, which is `n-1`.
- `prev` is 0.

Therefore, the print statement will output a formatted string with these values. 

Output: **? [n-1] [i] [n-1] 0**
