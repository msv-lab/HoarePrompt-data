Output State: **`i` is 3, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` must be greater than 3, `M` is a list containing the integers 1, `q // 2`, and 3.**

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `M`. Initially, `M` contains the integers 1 and `q // 2`. After appending, `M` will contain 1, `q // 2`, and 3. The values of `i`, `q`, and `w` remain unchanged.
