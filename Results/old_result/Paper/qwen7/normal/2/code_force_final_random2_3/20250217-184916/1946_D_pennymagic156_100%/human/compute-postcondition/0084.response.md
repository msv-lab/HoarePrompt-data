Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with `val`, `op` remains unchanged and is currently `False`, and `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the first element of `a` with `val`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` (which is the XOR of the first element of `a` with `val`) to the list `t`. Since `a` is a non-empty list and each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with `val`, the first element of `a` is also updated. The variable `op` remains unchanged and is still `False`. Therefore, `t` now contains one additional element, which is the result of the XOR operation between the first element of `a` and `val`.
