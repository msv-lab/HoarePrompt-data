Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, `r` is a list with either the value 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration.**

In this case, the code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
