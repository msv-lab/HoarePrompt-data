Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 1 or 4 depending on whether `temp * 2 < k` is true or false, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional context. All other variables retain their initial states.
