Based on the initial state provided:

- `tc` is 0.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements removed, so it is an empty list.
- `maxsize` is 0 because the list `a` is now empty.
- `mexsize` is 5.

The `print` statement is checking if `mexsize` is odd or even:

- `mexsize` is 5, which is an odd number.
- Since 5 % 2 == 1, the condition `mexsize % 2 == 1` evaluates to `True`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
