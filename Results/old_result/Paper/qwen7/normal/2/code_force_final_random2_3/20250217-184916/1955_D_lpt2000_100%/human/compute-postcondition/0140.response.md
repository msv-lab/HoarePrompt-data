Postcondition: `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is further decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.
