Output State: **`dp[i + 1]` is calculated as `(dp[k - 1] + (k - 1) * dp[k - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` and less than or equal to `m`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This does not affect the value of `dp[i + 1]` which is calculated separately according to its own formula. The variable `i` is updated to `i + 1`. The condition for `m` remains unchanged, meaning `m` must still be within the range `[i + 1, m]`.
