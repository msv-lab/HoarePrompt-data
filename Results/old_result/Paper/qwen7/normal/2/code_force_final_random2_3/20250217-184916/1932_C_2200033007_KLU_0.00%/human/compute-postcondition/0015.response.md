Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s` (i.e., `i + 1`), and `b` is a list containing the element `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the element `a[r]` to the list `b`. The conditions mentioned in the initial state (whether the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'L') do not affect the execution of this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `b` now contains the element `a[r]`.
