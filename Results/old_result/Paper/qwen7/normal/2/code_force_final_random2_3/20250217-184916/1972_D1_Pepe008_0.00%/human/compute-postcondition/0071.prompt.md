Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a`, `suma` is 0, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is converted to an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is converted to an integer from the second element of `info`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
        suma += x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is incremented by `x`; otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a + 1`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `x` is added to `suma`; otherwise, the value of `suma` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a + 3`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is \((a - (a + 3) \cdot (a + 2)) // (a + 3) + 1\), and `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`. If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), then the condition holds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged as there is no else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
