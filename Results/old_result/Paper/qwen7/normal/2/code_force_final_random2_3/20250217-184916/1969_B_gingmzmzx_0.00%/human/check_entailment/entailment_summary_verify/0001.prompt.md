You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the counts of zeros and ones in the string `s`. Specifically, `ans` is computed as the sum of the number of zeros in `s` plus the count of ones in `s` minus 1. The function prints `ans` for each test case and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these operations, where the cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the shifted substring.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads an integer `n` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string (`zeroes`).
   - It initializes two counters `cnt` for zeros and ones and a variable `ans` to store the total cost.
   - It iterates through the string and updates the counters and the cost.
   - Finally, it prints the total cost.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - The code reads the binary string as a list of integers, but it should be read as a string to correctly handle the cyclic shifts.
   - The logic to calculate the cost is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts and their costs.
   - The approach to finding the minimum cost is not accurate. The given code does not implement the correct algorithm to find the minimum cost.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to identify the positions where we need to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - We can use a more complex algorithm that identifies the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed and calculates their costs.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

**Correctness: **False**
