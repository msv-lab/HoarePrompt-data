Output State: **`y` is `n`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`, `x` is `n + 2`, `c` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The values of `y`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `y` is still `n`, `b` is still the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `x` is still `n + 2`. The only change is that `c` has been incremented by 1.
