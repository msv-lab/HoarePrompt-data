Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with `val`, `op` is now `val >> i & 1` (where `i` is the current index during the iteration), and `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the next element of `a` with `val`, and `ai` is 0.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `ai` the value `0`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `op`, `t`, or the elements within them. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `ai` being explicitly set to `0`.
