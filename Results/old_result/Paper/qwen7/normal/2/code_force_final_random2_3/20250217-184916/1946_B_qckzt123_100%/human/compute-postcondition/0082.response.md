Output State: **`i` is 5, `k` must be greater than 5, `t` is `t % MOD`**

The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t` modulo `MOD`. Since the original value of `t` was twice its original value and `k` must be greater than 5, the updated value of `t` is `t % MOD`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
