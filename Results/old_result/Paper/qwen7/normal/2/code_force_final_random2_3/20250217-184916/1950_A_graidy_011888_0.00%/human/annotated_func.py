#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')

    #State: Output State: `i` is 1001, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.
    #
    #After the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i` = 1 to `i` = 1000), the value of `i` will be 1001 because it starts at 1 and increments by 1 at the end of each iteration. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be random integers generated within each iteration of the loop, and `res` will be determined based on the conditions specified in the loop body, resulting in either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers (x, y, z) each ranging from 1 to 9. For each set, it determines and prints whether the sequence forms a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' pattern based on the values of x, y, and z. After completing 1000 iterations, the function does not return any value.
