Output State: **`max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, and all other variables retain their previous states.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` updates the value of `max_profit` to be the same as the current value of `current_profit`. Since `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` before this assignment, `max_profit` is updated to this new value. All other variables (`combined`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`) retain their states from the last iteration of the loop as no changes are applied to them.
