Output State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, `final` contains the element `elem`, `lst` must contain at least one element, and the current value of `elem` is an element in `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` to the list `final`. The values of `mini` and `lst` remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `elem` is such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini` still holds true.
