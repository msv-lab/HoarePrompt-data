### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly initializes variables and reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the constraints for each test case.
   - It uses sets and variables to keep track of the constraints efficiently.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - The program processes each constraint by updating `ax` (minimum upper bound), `bx` (maximum lower bound), and `cx` (set of excluded values).
   - This part of the code correctly handles the different types of constraints:
     - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Validation and Calculation**:
   - The program checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to the result list `r` because there are no valid `k` values.
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of excluded values in `cx` from the range `[bx+1, ax-1]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case correctly.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
- The logic for handling constraints and calculating the valid range of `k` values is sound.
- The program correctly handles edge cases where `bx` might be greater than or equal to `ax`.
- The use of sets to manage excluded values ensures that duplicates are not counted more than once.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
