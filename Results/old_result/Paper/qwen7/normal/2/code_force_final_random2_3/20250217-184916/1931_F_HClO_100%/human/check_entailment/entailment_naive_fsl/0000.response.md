Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial orders of the screenshots are inconsistent. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
3 3
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 1 2
```

In this case, the first screenshot shows `[1, 2, 3]`, the second shows `[2, 3, 1]`, and the third shows `[3, 1, 2]`. The program attempts to align these orders, but it fails to recognize that these orders are inconsistent and cannot correspond to a single valid order of participants. The program incorrectly outputs "YES" in this case because it does not properly check for consistency among the screenshots.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all screenshots can be aligned consistently without contradictions. This involves checking if the relative positions of participants in all screenshots are consistent with each other.
