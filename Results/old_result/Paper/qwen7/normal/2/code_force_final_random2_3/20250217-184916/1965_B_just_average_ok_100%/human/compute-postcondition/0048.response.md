Output State: **`i` is 20, `idx` is 20, `nums` is a list with elements [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048576].**

Explanation: The loop iterates through all elements in the list `nums` from index 0 to 20. Since the loop does not break until the last iteration, `idx` is set to the last index, which is 20. After the loop, `k - nums[idx]` is appended to `nums`. Given that `idx` is 20, `nums[idx]` is 1048576, and since `k` is an input integer, `k - nums[idx]` is appended to `nums`, resulting in the last element being `1048576 - 1048576 = 0`. Therefore, the updated `nums` list includes the original elements plus the new element 0.
