Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input, `max` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `max = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `max`. No other changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
