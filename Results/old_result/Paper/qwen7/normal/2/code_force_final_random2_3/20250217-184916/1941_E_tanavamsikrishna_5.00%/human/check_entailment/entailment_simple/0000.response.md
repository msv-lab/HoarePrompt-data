### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` processes a single row of river depths.
   - It increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1.
   - For the rest of the elements, it calculates the minimum value of the previous `d` elements (or 0 if out of bounds) and adds 1 to the current element plus this minimum value.
   - The function returns the last element of the processed row.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes the entire grid of river depths.
   - It calls `func_1` on each row to get the cost of building a bridge on that row.
   - It then computes the cost of building `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost among these sums.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it correctly computes the cost of building bridges on consecutive rows using the logic defined in `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - The output matches the expected results provided in the example.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The steps are logically sound and the functions are used appropriately to achieve the desired result.
