Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set containing `x`; `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007; `bx` is either -1 or max(`x`, -1); `a` is the first integer input; `x` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was either an empty set or a set containing `x`, after adding `x` to `cx`, `cx` now contains `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
