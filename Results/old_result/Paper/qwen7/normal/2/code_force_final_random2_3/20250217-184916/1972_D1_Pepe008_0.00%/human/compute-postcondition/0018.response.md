Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.
2. **Determine the current values and conditions**:
   - `T` must be greater than 0.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is `int(info[0])`.
   - `b` must be at least 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `x` is 2.
   - If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, then `suma` is `x` (which is 2). Otherwise, no change to the variables.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i in range(1, b + 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `b + 1`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - Since `b` must be at least 3, it remains unchanged as it is not specified to change in the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `T` remains greater than 0.
   - `t` remains 0.
   - `a` remains `int(info[0])`.
   - `b` remains at least 3.
   - `i` is updated to 4.
   - `x` remains 2.
   - `suma` remains unchanged unless the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` is met, but since `i` is now 4, this condition will not be met (as `i` was 3 in the previous iteration and increasing `i` to 4 will not satisfy the condition).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 3, `i` is 4, `x` is 2, `suma` is unchanged.**
