Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `R` is `x`, `leftover` is the return value of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The variable `R` is assigned the value of `x`. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `numCuts` is still 0, `R` is now `x`, and `leftover` retains its value as the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`.
