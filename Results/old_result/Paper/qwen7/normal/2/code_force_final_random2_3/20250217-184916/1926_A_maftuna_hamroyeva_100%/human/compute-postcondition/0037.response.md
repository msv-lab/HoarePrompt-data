Output State: **`a` must have at least one character; `j` is 'A'; `l` is 1**.

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other number). Since the initial value of `l` is not specified, we can only say that `l` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
