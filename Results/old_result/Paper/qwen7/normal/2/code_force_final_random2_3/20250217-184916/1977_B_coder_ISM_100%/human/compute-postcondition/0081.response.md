Output State: **`i` is 28, `flag` is 1, the character at index 0 of string `s` is '1', and the characters at indices 1 through 28 of string `s` are '-1', and the character at index 29 of string `s` is '0', and the length of string `s` is 30.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` appends the character '1' to the end of the string `s`. Initially, the string `s` is "1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-0". After appending '1', the string becomes "1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-0-1", which has a length of 30. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged.
