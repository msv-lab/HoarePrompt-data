Postcondition: `lex` is an integer with a value greater than or equal to 28, and `arr` is a list containing the element 26. If `lex` is less than 52, it is an integer with a value greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, it remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to 52, and `arr` always contains the element 26.
