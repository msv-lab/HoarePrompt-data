Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `a`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position where the condition `a[i-1] > a[i]` holds.
   - It then splits the array at this position into two parts: `new = a[i:]` and considers the remaining part as `a[0:i]`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`: This checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the second part.
     - `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This checks if the second part is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If either condition fails, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initial Check:**
   - The initial check correctly identifies if the array is already sorted. If true, the program should print 'YES', which is handled correctly.

2. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - The logic to split the array and check the conditions is correct. However, there are a few issues:
     - The condition `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` is incorrect. It should be checking if the first element of the original array is less than or equal to every element in the second part, not the other way around.
     - The condition `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])` is correct but should be checked only if the previous condition is true.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] <= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has a logical error in the initial check and the handling of unsorted arrays. After correcting these issues, the program should work as expected.

**Correctness: False**
