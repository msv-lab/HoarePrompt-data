Output State: **`t` is an integer, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input.**

The code `b = int(b)` converts the second word from the input into an integer and assigns it to `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
