Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error. The problem requires selecting the minimum of the two chosen numbers (`\min(x, y)`) at each step, but the code incorrectly adds the larger of the two numbers instead of the smaller one. This results in a lower score than the optimal solution.

To fix this, the code should add `min(a, b)` instead of `max(a, b)` when summing up the scores. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum of the two selected numbers is always added to the score, leading to the optimal solution.
