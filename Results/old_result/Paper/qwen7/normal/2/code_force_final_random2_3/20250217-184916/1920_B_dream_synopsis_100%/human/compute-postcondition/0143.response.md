Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes each test case according to the given constraints and returns no value.**
