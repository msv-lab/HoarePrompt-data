Postcondition: `c` is 0, `x` is equal to `n`, `a` is now `l[0]`, `b` is either `l[y]` where `y` is 1 and `l[y] > l[y - 1]` (we break out of the most internal loop or if statement), or `b` remains 0 if the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` is false. `l` is a list of integers created from the input, and `y` is 1.
