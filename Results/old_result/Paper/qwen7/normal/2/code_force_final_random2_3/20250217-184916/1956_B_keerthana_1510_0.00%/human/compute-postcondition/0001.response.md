Output State: **`elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string stored in `line`**.

Explanation: The code `elements = line.split()` splits the string stored in the variable `line` into a list of substrings based on whitespace (or other specified delimiters) and assigns this list to the variable `elements`. The initial state of `line` is not specified, but after executing the code, `elements` will contain the split parts of `line`.
