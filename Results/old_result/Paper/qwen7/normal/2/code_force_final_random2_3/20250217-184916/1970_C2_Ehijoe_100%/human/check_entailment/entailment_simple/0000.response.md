### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game and Problem**:
   - The game involves a tree with `n` nodes, and `t` rounds (in this case, `t = 1`).
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, and players take turns moving the stone to an unactivated neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The goal is to determine the winner based on the initial node and the tree structure.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a node can force a win in the game starting from that node.
   - It uses a recursive approach to determine if any of the neighbors can force a win.
   - If the node has only one neighbor (and that neighbor is the parent), it returns `False` because the node cannot force a win.
   - Otherwise, it recursively checks the neighbors and returns `True` if any of them can force a win.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the tree from input and determines the winner based on the initial node.
   - It reads the number of nodes (`n`) and the edges of the tree.
   - It builds the adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - It identifies the leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor).
   - It reads the starting node for the game.
   - It calls `func_1` to determine if the starting node can force a win.
   - Based on the result, it prints "Ron" or "Hermione".

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies if a node can force a win by checking its neighbors recursively.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly constructs the tree and determines the winner based on the initial node and the tree structure.
   - Given the constraints and the nature of the game, the provided code should work correctly for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the initial node and the tree structure. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
