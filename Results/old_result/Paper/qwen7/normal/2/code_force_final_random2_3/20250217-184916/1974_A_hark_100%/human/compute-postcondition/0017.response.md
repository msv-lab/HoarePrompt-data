Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is a positive integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- Either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and it is given that \((x \neq 0 \text{ or } y \leq 0)\), but `x` is not greater than 0 and `y` is not equal to 0.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:
- Since `x` is not greater than 0 and `y` is not equal to 0, it means `x` must be less than or equal to 0 and `y` must be greater than 0.
- The specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but their conditions are clear.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(0)
```

The output will be directly the integer 0, as specified in the print statement.

Output: **0**
