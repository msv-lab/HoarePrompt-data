Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are overlapping constraints. Specifically, the program calculates the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of elements in `cx` that fall within this range. However, it does not account for the fact that the constraints could overlap in such a way that the range `[bx, ax]` might include values that are not valid due to the `not equal to` constraints.

For example, consider the following input:
- Test case with `n = 4`
- Constraints: 
  1. `1 3` (k ≥ 3)
  2. `2 10` (k ≤ 10)
  3. `3 1` (k ≠ 1)
  4. `3 5` (k ≠ 5)

According to the problem description, the valid range for `k` is `[3, 10]`, but excluding `1` and `5`. The program would calculate the range `[3, 10]` and then subtract the number of invalid values (1 and 5), resulting in `8`. However, the correct answer should be `7` because the value `1` is not in the range `[3, 10]` and should not be subtracted.

To fix this, the program needs to properly account for the overlaps and exclusions. One way to do this is to use interval arithmetic to handle the ranges and exclusions more accurately.
