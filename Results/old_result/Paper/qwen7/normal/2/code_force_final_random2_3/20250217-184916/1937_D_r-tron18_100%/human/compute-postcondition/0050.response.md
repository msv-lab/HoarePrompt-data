Postcondition: `i` is `n - 3`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on the value of `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `ol <= zr`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]` and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.
