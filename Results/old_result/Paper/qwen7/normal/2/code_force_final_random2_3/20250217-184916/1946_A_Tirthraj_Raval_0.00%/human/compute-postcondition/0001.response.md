Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` (which is a positive integer) will represent the length of the array `a`, and `a` will be a list of `n` integers, each within the specified range. The initial values of `n` and `a` are not set yet, so they remain undefined until further input is provided for each test case.
