Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program checks whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program incorrectly implements this check. Specifically, the line `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` does not reflect the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The program increments `ans` by `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each \(b\) from 2 to the minimum of \(n\) and \(m\). This operation does not account for the actual condition that needs to be satisfied, which involves checking every possible pair \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.

3. **Missing Pair-wise Evaluation**: The program does not evaluate each pair \((a, b)\) individually to check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\). Instead, it makes an incorrect assumption about the count of valid pairs based on a simplified calculation.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
