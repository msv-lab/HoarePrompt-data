Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial state to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Loop:
```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial State:
- `left` is 5
- `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`
- `i` is the last character in `sChar`
- `cost` is `right - 4`
- `right` is equal to the length of `s`
- The length of `s` must be at least 2
- `s[1]` must not be '1'
- `s[4]` must not be '1'
- No character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0'
- `s[right]` must be '0'

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1:** `left < len(s)`
   - Initially, `left` is 5 and `right` is the length of `s`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `left` must be less than `len(s)`.

2. **Condition 2:** `s[left] != '1'`
   - Initially, `s[left]` is the value at index 5 in the list `s`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `left` is 5 and `right` is the length of `s`, `left` must be less than `right` for the loop to execute the first time.
- Additionally, `s[left]` must not be '1' for the loop to execute the first time.

Given these conditions, the only adjustments needed are to ensure that `left` is less than `right` and that `s[left]` is not '1'.

### Final Answer:
State: **`left` is 5, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - 4`, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, the length of `s` must be at least 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', `s[4]` must not be '1', no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0', `s[right]` must be '0', and `s[5]` must not be '1'**.
