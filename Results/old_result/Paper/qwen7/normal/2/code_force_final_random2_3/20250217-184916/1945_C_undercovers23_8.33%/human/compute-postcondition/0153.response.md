Output State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, `final` is a list containing the element `elem` and an additional element `elem`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially a list containing the element `elem` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, after appending `elem` again, `final` now contains two elements, both of which are `elem`. The value of `mini` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
