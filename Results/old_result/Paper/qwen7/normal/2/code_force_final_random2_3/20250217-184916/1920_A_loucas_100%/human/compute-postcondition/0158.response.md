Postcondition: **`no` is a list containing either 'a' or an empty list, `big` is either a list containing 'a' or an empty list, `less` is either a list containing 'a' or an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is the first integer input from the split, `a` is the second integer input from the split, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. If `x` equals 2, `no` remains unchanged and includes 'a' if it did before. Otherwise, `no` is updated to include 'a' if it didn't before.**
