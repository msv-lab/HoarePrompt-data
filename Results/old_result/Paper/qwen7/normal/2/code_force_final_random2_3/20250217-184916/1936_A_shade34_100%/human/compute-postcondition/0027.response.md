Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that any pending output is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are modified, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
