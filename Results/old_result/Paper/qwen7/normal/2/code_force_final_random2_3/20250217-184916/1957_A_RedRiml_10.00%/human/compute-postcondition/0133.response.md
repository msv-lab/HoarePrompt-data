Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `palka` is not empty.
- `i` is the first element of `palka`.
- `d[i]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is not in `pl`, then `d[i]` is set to 1.
- If `i` is in `pl`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `d[i]` is set to 1.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in palka:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `palka`.
2. **Variable `i`**: Initially, `i` is the first element of `palka`.
3. **Condition Inside the Loop**:
   - If `i` is not in `pl`, then `d[i]` is set to 1.
   - If `i` is in `pl`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `d[i]` is set to 1.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `palka` is not empty.
   - `i` is the first element of `palka`.
   - `d[i]` is set to 1.
   
2. **After the First Iteration**:
   - If `i` was not in `pl`, then `d[i]` remains 1.
   - If `i` was in `pl`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `d[i]` is set to 1.
   
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The next value of `i` will be the next element in `palka`.
   - We need to check if this new `i` is in `pl` or not.
   - If it is not in `pl`, then `d[i]` will be set to 1.
   - If it is in `pl`, then `i` will be incremented by 1 and `d[i]` will be set to 1.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `palka` remains the same (it is not modified inside the loop).
- `i` becomes the next element in `palka`.
- `d[i]` will be set to 1 based on the condition (either directly or after incrementing `i`).

### Final Answer:
State: **`palka` is not empty, `i` is the next element of `palka`, and `d[i]` is set to 1**.

This means that `i` will be the next element in `palka`, and `d[i]` will be set to 1 based on the condition specified in the loop.
