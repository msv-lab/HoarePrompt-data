Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the input integer from the initial state and the second element is the new input integer; `n` is the new input integer.**

Explanation: The code appends a new input integer to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contained one element which was the input integer from the initial state. After appending, `a` now contains two elements: the original input integer and the new input integer. The value of `n` is set to the new input integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
