Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `n` is an input integer (its value is not specified).
- `s` is the string input by the user, but it does not contain the substring 'map'.
- `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`. Since `s` does not contain 'map', `m` is 0.
- `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

The expression `m + p` evaluates to `0 + p`, which is just `p`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string `s`.

Output: **p (where p is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string s)**
