Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is 0
- `n` is `num`
- `i` is equal to `k`
- `num` is the sum of increments based on the condition in the loop
- `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted during the final iteration of the loop

The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer 0.

Output: **0**
