Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `line` is an input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `line.split()` to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` splits the string `line` into a list of substrings based on whitespace, then converts each substring to an integer using the `map` function, and finally assigns the resulting list to the variable `T`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
