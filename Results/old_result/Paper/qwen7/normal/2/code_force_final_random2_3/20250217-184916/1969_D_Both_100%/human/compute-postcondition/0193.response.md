Output State: **`combined` is now a list with one less item than before, `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list, and `current_profit` is the sum of the first and second elements of `item`.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit += item[0]` adds the first element of the `item` list to the `current_profit` variable. Since `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list, and the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is less than 0, `current_profit` now holds the value of the first element of `item`. The length of `combined` is reduced by one because `item` was the last element of the original list, and it has been removed.
