Output: **A**

Explanation: The `print('A')` statement directly prints the string 'A'. According to the initial state, `ac` is greater than `bc`, but this information is not needed to determine what is printed by the statement. The statement itself does not depend on the values of `ac` and `bc`; it simply prints the string 'A'.
