Output State: `x` is 3, `n` is at least 18, `y` is 4, `m` is at least 18, and `cnt` is 1.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` remains 3 because it is not modified within the loop. The value of `y` becomes 4 after 3 iterations. Since the loop continues as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, and given that `x` is 3 and `y` is 4, the condition `(x + y) * x = 21 * 3 = 63` will eventually become false when `n` is less than 63, but we are not concerned with the exact value of `n` beyond ensuring it is at least 18 based on the provided states. Similarly, `(x + y) * y = 21 * 4 = 84` will also eventually become false when `m` is less than 84, but we know `m` must be at least 18 based on the provided states. The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1 each time the gcd of `x` and `y` is 1, which happens exactly once during the first iteration since gcd(3, 1) ≠ 1 and gcd(3, 2) = 1, and gcd(3, 3) ≠ 1, and gcd(3, 4) ≠ 1. Therefore, `cnt` remains 1.
