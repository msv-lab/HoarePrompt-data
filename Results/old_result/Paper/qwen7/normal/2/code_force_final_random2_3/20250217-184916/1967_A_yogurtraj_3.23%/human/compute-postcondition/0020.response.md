Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[1] + k // (i + 1)` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `i + 1` equals 2, so `r` becomes `a[1] + k // 2`. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
