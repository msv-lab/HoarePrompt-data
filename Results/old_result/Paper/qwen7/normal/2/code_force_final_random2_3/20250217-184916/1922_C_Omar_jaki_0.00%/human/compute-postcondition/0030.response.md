Postcondition: **`b` is a list with three elements where the first element is `0 + v_3`, the second element is `v_3 + v_3`, and the third element is `v_3 + v_3`, `x` is `w_3`, `y` is `x`, `z` is `y`, `v` is `v_3`, `u` is `u - 1`, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the postcondition remains as initially described. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, the postcondition remains the same as well.**
