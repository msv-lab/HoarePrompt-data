Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with its length greater than 1, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 1. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` is '1', then `flag` is set to True and `j` is incremented to 1. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `count`, and `j` remain unchanged.
