Output State: **`k` is either -4 or -2, `i` is 4, `ans2` now contains the element `c[4]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2. Since `k` can initially be either 0 or -2, decrementing it by 2 results in `k` being either -4 or -2. The values of `i` and `ans2` remain unchanged.
