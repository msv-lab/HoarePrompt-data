Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is `x`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining, `s` is the sum of all elements in the remaining list `a`**.

Explanation: The initial value of `t` is `max(0, 0)`, which is 0. The code `tmp += x` increments `tmp` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is not defined before this line, it remains as `x` in the output state. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `s`) are not affected by this line of code.
