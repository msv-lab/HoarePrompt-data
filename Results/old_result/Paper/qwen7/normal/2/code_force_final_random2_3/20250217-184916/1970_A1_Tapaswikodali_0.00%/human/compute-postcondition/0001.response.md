Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence; `balance` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `balance` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `s` is still a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence, and `balance` is set to 0.
