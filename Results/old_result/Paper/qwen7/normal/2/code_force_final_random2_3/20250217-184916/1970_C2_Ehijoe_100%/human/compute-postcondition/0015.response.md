Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, nodes[v] includes u**

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid.
