Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new set `relevant_b` which contains elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`. The values of `results`, `t`, `unique_a`, and `unique_b` remain unchanged.
