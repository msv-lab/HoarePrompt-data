Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < 20`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `j` will increment by 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 19
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0
   - `ans` contains the value 524288 (which is \(1 << 19\))

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be \(19 + 1 = 20\).
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`j < 20`) will no longer be true when `j` becomes 20, so the loop will terminate after this iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 0.
   - The value of `ans` does not change within the loop body, so it still contains the value 524288.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be 20.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `ans` will still contain the value 524288.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the final iteration in this case) is:

**State: `j` is 20, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` contains the value 524288**.
