Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` values. The calculation of `required_mod_x` should be `(x - num % x) % x` to ensure it falls within the valid range for modulo operations. However, the current implementation might not handle all cases correctly, especially when `num % x` is already `0`.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

- Input: `t = 1`, `n = 6`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`, `a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
- Expected Output: `2` (as per the problem statement)

However, the program will not produce the correct result because it incorrectly handles the modulo calculations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] = 0
            freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

This corrected version ensures that the modulo calculations are handled correctly, thus meeting the problem description for all potential cases.
