Output State: `a` is an empty list, `val` does not exist since `a` is empty, `op` is the result of XORing all the i-th bits of the elements in `a` (initially 0 and then XORed with each `val`), and `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `op` is `False`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will be an empty list because all its elements have been processed. The variable `op` will be the cumulative result of XORing the i-th bit of each element in `a`. The variable `cnt` will count how many times `op` became `False` during the loop's execution.
