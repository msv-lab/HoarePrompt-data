The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `num` is either 2 or 4.
- `i` is 1.
- `c` is an integer from the input split.
- `r` is an integer from the input split.

If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` is incremented by 2, making it 4. Otherwise, `num` remains either 2 or 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Since `i` starts at 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be 2. Therefore, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 2 or 4, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split**
