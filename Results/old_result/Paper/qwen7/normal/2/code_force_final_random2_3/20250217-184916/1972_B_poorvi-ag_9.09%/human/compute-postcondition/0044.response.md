Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in results:`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next element in the `results` list. Since `i` is set to the next element in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the `results` list.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in the `results` list, and `results` is the same list.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the next element in the `results` list. Since `results` is unchanged from the previous iteration, the only thing that changes is the value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next element in the `results` list.

**State: **`i` is the next element in the `results` list, `results` is the same list**
