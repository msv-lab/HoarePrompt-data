Output State: **`a` must have at least one character, `i` is 0, `f` is not 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `b[i]`; the current value of `b[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been swapped at index `i`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
