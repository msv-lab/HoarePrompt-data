Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list `a`
   - `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`
   - `new_all` is True if all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order
   - In both cases (whether the if condition is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**
