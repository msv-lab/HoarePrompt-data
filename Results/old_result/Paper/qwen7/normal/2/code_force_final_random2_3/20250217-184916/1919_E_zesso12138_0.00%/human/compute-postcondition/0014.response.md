Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value obtained from `data[index]`.**

This output state reflects that the value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`, while all other variables retain their previous states with the exception of `index`, which is updated to `index + n + 1`.
