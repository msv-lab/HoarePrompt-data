Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, the values of `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split by space**.

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to variables `c` and `r`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the integers provided by the input.
