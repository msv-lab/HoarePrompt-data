Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - `n` is greater than 0 (though `n` is not used in the print statement).
   - `h` is an integer within the range of 1 to 23. If `h` is 0, `day` is set to 'AM' and `h` is set to 12. Otherwise, `day` is set to 'PM', and if `h` is greater than 12, it is adjusted to `h - 12`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```
   This statement formats `h` and `m` as two-digit strings and concatenates them with `day`.

Given these details, let's consider the possible scenarios for `h` and `m`:

- If `h` is between 1 and 12, `day` will be 'PM' if `h` is greater than 12 (which won't happen since `h` is capped at 12). So, `day` will be 'PM'.
- If `h` is 0, `day` is set to 'AM' and `h` is adjusted to 12.
- If `h` is 13 to 23, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12`, so `h` will be between 1 and 11, and `day` will be 'PM'.

In all valid cases, `h` will be a number from 1 to 12 after adjustment, and `day` will be 'PM'. The value of `m` is not specified, but it will be an integer.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string in the format `{h:02d}:{m:02d} PM`, where `{h:02d}` is a two-digit representation of `h` and `{m:02d}` is a two-digit representation of `m`.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} PM** (where {h:02d} is a two-digit representation of `h` and {m:02d} is a two-digit representation of `m`)
