Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, t, edges, leaves, start, and moves. It returns a boolean value.**

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree.
- `t` is an integer such that t = 1, which is a constant value.
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, where each tuple (u, v) indicates an undirected edge between nodes u and v.
- `leaves` is a deque containing the leaf nodes of the tree.
- `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, indicating the starting node for the first round.
- `moves` is a boolean value returned by `func_1`, indicating whether Ron can make a move.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept these parameters and return a boolean value based on the given conditions and the result of `func_1`.
