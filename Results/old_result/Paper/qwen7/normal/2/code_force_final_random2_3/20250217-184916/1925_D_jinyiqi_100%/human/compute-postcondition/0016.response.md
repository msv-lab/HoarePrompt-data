Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `b` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration, `j` is the last value it took during the loop execution, which is `m-1`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `cn2` as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is a mathematical operation involving `n`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `sum_f`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
