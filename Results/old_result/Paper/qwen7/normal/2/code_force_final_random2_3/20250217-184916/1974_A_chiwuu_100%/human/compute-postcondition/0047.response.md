Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n):`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is initially set to 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but it does not change the values of `i` or `n` directly.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `n` remains the same unless the loop body changes it, but since the loop body is omitted, `n` remains unchanged.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` remains the same and is still greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is either `b // 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is updated to either `b // 2 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15` or `b // 2 + (a - b * 4) // 15 + 2`, and `t1` remains as `t * 15 - b * 4`**.
