You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5. The string a consists of n characters where each character is one of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', or 'G'.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and always returns 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each of the `m` rounds can have at least one problem of each difficulty level. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the number of rounds `m` might require more problems than just ensuring each difficulty level appears at least once.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
10 2
BGECDCBDED
```

In this case, the program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `4`. Here's why:

- The bank has 10 problems: B, G, E, C, D, C, B, D, E, D.
- To hold 2 rounds, we need at least 2 problems of each difficulty level ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G').

The current implementation only checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and adds the difference to the answer. However, it does not ensure that the total count of problems for each difficulty level is sufficient for `m` rounds.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the count of each difficulty level is at least `m`. If any difficulty level is missing, the program should add the necessary number of problems for that level.
