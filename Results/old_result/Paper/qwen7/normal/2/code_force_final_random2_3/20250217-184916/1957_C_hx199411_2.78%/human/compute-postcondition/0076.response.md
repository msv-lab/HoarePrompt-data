Postcondition: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` equals `k`, `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted during the loop's final iteration, `num` is the sum of 2 added for each pair of inputs where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`, and `m` is calculated as `n - num`. The condition `m` equals 0 is also true.**
