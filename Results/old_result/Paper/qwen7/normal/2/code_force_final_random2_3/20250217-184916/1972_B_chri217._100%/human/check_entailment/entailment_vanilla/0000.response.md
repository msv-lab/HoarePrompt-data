Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - This part of the code is correct and matches the problem requirements.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_2` processes each test case.
   - It counts the number of 'U' (facing up) coins in the string `s`.
   - If the count of 'U' coins is even, it returns 'YES'.
   - If the count of 'U' coins is odd, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Game Logic:**
   - The problem states that the game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
   - The key observation here is that each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by at least one.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even initially, Alice can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Bob, and vice versa.
   - Therefore, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position, and if it is odd, Bob can do the same.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the parity (even or odd) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - This aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial number of facing-up coins. The function `func_2` accurately reflects the game's outcome for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
