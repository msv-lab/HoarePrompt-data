Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `loop` ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
    if num < 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    for i in no:
        if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
            num -= 1
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: All elements from `no` have been iterated over, and for each iteration, the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)` was satisfied, leading to `num` being decremented by 1 for each such element. Therefore, `num` is now equal to zero since all elements in `no` that met the condition have been processed. The variables `innerLoop` is now 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1` (which is -1), `big` contains all integers `a` for which `x` was 1 during the iterations, `less` contains all integers `a` for which `x` was 2 during the iterations, and `no` is empty as all its elements have been processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `no` contains no integers, `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged, and `num` is decremented by the number of times an element in `no` satisfied the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.

Explanation: Since the loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the `no` list, and given that each iteration checks if the current element `i` satisfies the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`, and upon satisfying the condition, `num` is decremented by 1, after all iterations, `no` will be empty (since all elements that satisfy the condition are removed). The lists `big` and `less` remain unchanged because the loop does not modify them. `num` is decremented by the count of elements in `no` that satisfied the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All integers in the `no` list are such that they are either less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, or they do not affect the value of `num` when the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)` is checked. The `num` variable is 0, `innerLoop` is equal to the original number of iterations, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, and the `no` list remains unchanged from its final state after the loop completes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
