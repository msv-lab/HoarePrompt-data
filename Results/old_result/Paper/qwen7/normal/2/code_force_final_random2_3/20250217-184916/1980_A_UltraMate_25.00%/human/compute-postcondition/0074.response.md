Output State: **`t` is 5, `hmp` is a collection containing 'ABCDEF', the first element of `hmp` is 'A', `m` is 'F', `ans` is 20, `s` is an input string, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The other variables (`t`, `hmp`, `m`, `ans`, `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `s` now holds the value of the user's input, while the other variables retain their original values.
