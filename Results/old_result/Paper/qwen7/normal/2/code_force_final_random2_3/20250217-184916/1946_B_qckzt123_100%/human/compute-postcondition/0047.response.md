Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:
- `i` is 3.
- `t` is 16 modulo `MOD`.
- `ans` is 16 modulo `MOD`.

From the explanation given, we also know that after the loop completes (which it has, since `i` is 3 and the loop ran 3 times), `ans` is 16 modulo `MOD`.

Therefore, when the `print(ans)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `ans`, which is 16 modulo `MOD`.

Output: **16**
