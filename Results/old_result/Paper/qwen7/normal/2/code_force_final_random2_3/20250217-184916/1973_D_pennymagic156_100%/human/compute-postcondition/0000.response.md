Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`**.

This means that after executing the line `n, k = func_3()`, the values of `n` and `k` are set to the values returned by the function `func_3()`. The conditions 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4 still hold true, as they were part of the initial state.
