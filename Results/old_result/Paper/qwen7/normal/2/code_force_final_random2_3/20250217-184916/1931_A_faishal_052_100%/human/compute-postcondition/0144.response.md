Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27` depending on the initial value of `lex`, if `lex` was less than 27, `arr` contains the elements [1, 2] or [1, 26], if `lex` was between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the elements [26, 2] or [26], if `lex` was 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged and contains the element 1; `arr` now contains the additional element 1.**

Explanation: The code `lex = lex - 1` decrements the value of `lex` by 1. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, the new value of `lex` will be either `lex - 1` (if it was originally less than 27), `lex - 28` (if it was between 27 and 52 exclusive), or `lex - 27` (if it was 52 or greater). The value of `j` remains unchanged, and `arr` now contains the additional element 1.
