Output State: **`shapes` is increased by 1, `d[j]` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, d is a list of integers, j is an index within the range of the list d.**

The code `shapes += 1` increments the value of the variable `shapes` by 1. The values of `d[j]`, `d`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.
