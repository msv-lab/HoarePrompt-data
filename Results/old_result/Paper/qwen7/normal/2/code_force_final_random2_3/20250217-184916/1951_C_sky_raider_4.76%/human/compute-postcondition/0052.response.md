Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `s` is the smaller value between `m` and `k`
   - `k` is updated as `k - s`
   - `c` is updated as `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, so `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`
   - `n` remains unchanged
   - `m` remains unchanged
   - `k` is updated as `k - s`
   - `s` remains unchanged (since it is based on `m` and `k`, and these values haven't changed yet)
   - `c` remains unchanged (since the update to `c` is based on the current value of `i`, and `i` hasn't changed yet)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is `k - s`, `s` is the smaller value between `m` and `k`, `c` is `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`**
