Output State: The loop will either print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop. If the loop completes all its iterations without finding any pair of elements where `a[i-1] > a[i]` and also satisfies the conditions `check_all_new` and `new_all` being True, it will continue to the end and print 'YES'. Otherwise, it will print 'NO' at some point during the iterations.

To summarize, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- If there exists no `i` such that `a[i-1] > a[i]` and the conditions `check_all_new` and `new_all` are satisfied for the remaining elements, the output will be 'YES'.
- Otherwise, the output will be 'NO'.

This is because the loop checks for the condition `a[i-1] > a[i]` and breaks if found, but also checks the remaining elements to ensure they meet the criteria of `check_all_new` and `new_all` being True. If these conditions are met throughout the loop's execution, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
