Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to continue.

3. **Determine the Next Value for `i`:**
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs.
   - Therefore, if `i` was 2, the next value of `i` would be 3.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is now 3, `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - The variable `max` is mentioned in the postcondition but not directly in the loop head. Therefore, its value does not change based on the loop head alone.

6. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.
   - `i` should be set to 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
