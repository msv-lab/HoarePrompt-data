Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1; `sumk` is 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `l` is set to 1, `r` is set to n - 2, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged, and `l` and `r` remain as they were.
