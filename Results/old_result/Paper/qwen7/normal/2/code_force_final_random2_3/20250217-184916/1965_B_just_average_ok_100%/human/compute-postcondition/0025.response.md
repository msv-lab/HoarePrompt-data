Output State: **`i` is 2, `idx` is 1, `nums` is a list with elements [2, k + 1]**.

Explanation: The code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 1, `1 << idx` equals `1 << 1`, which is 2. Therefore, the number 2 is removed from the list `[2, k - 1, k + 1]`, leaving the list as `[k - 1, k + 1]`. Since `k - 1` was replaced by `k + 1` in the example, the updated list is `[2, k + 1]`. The variables `i` and `idx` remain unchanged.
