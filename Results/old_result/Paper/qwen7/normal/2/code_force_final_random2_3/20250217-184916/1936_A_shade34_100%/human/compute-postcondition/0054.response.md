Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a new string from input, `pans` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[i, n]` depending on whether `s` is equal to '<' or not, and `mak` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Since `i` was previously equal to `n`, `mak` now also equals `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
