Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two positive integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    if n == 1:
        print(k)
    else:
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        ans = []
        temp = 1
        while True:
            if temp * 2 < k:
                temp *= 2
                i += 1
            else:
                break
        ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
        ans.append(k - sum(ans))
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list containing three elements \([0, (1 << i) - 1, k - (1 << i) - 1]\), and `temp` is such that `temp * 2 \>= k` if `n` is not equal to 1. If `n` is 1, then `k` is either 1 or 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`. If `n` equals 1, the function does not change `l1`, `n`, and `k`. Otherwise, `i` is the number of times `temp * 2` was less than `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is still equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)` followed by 0s to make its length equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`. If `n` equals 1, the function does not change any additional variables. Otherwise, `i` is between 1 and 4 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, `ans` has been extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
