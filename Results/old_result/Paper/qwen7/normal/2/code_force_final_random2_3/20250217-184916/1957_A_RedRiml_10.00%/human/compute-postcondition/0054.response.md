Output State: **`shapes` is 3, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is a list of all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered, `w` must be greater than 3, `ln` is an input integer.**

The code `ln = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `ln`. The other variables (`shapes`, `palka`, `d`, `pl`, and `w`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
