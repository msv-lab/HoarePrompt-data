Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is the new input string from the user.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new string `s`.
- `b` is a string which is the sorted version of the input string `s`.
- `c` is a string which is the sorted version of the input string `s` but in descending order.

The `print(c)` statement will print the string `c`, which is the sorted version of the input string `s` in descending order.

Output: **c (where c is the sorted version of the input string s in descending order)**
