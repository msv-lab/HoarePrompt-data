Output State: **`i` is 20, `idx` is 20, `nums` is a list with elements [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048577]**.

The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Since the value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. However, based on the initial state, the last element of `nums` before appending was `1048576`. Therefore, `k` must be `1048576`, making `k + 1` equal to `1048577`. Thus, the new list `nums` contains all the original elements plus the new element `1048577`.
