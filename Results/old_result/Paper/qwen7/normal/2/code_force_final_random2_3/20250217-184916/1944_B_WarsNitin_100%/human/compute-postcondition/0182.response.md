Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is decreased by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 2, but its initial value is not specified. Since `i` and `n` are not affected by the given code, they retain their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `k` being decreased by 2.
