Output State: **The program returns a list `M` containing all integers from 1 up to and including the square root `w` of `q`, where `q` is a perfect square greater than 1 and `w` is an integer.**

This output state is derived from the given initial conditions and the provided code snippet. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

- `w` is defined as the square root of `q`, and `q` is a perfect square greater than 1.
- `M` is initialized to contain all integers from 1 up to and including `w`.
- The loop increments `i` until it reaches `w + 1`.
- During each iteration, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, either `i` or `q // i` is added to the list `M`.
- Since the loop processes all divisors of `q` up to `w`, `M` will include all integers from 1 up to and including `w`.

Therefore, the final list `M` will contain all integers from 1 up to and including `w`.
