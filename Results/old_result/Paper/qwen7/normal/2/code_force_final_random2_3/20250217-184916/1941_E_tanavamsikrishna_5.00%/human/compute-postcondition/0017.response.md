The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `row`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `d`, which is a positive integer. The function iterates through the list `row` and increments the elements at indices from 0 to `d-2` by 1. For all other indices, the elements retain their original values. Finally, the function returns the last element of the modified list `row`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d`. It increments the elements at indices from 0 to `d-2` by 1 and keeps the rest unchanged. The function returns the last element of the modified list `row`.**
