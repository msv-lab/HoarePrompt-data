Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly calculates the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over `k` excursions.
   - For each friendship `(a, b, f)`, the friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion it is chosen. Since the pairs are chosen randomly and equiprobably, the expected number of times a friendship is chosen in `k` excursions is `k/2` (since there are `n*(n-1)/2` possible pairs and `m` of them are friends).
   - The formula used `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `f * k % MOD` because each friendship value increases by 1 for each of the `k` excursions it is chosen, and the probability of choosing any specific friendship in each excursion is `1 / (n*(n-1)/2)`. However, since we are summing up the expected values, we simply need to multiply the friendship value by `k`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input for each test case, processes the friendships using `func_1`, and prints the result.
   - The logic for reading inputs and processing each test case is correct.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the results.
   - The logic for handling the inputs and outputs is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the analysis above, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the expected sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

Correctness: **True**
