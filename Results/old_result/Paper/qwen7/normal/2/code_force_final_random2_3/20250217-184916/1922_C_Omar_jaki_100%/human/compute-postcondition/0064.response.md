Output State: **`u` is `u - 1`; `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`**

Explanation: The variable `u` was already defined as `u - 1` in the initial state. The code `c, d = r()` calls the function `r()` which returns two values. These values are assigned to `c` and `d` respectively. Since the exact values returned by `r()` are not specified, they are represented as the return values of `r()`. The initial value of `u` remains unchanged from its previous state.
