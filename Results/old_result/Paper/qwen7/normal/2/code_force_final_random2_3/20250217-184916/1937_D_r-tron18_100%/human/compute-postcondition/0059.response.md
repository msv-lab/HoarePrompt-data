Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and `n - 1`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, and `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `zeroInd` using the function `func_1` applied to the list `suffZero` with two different arguments. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The exact value of `zeroInd` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but it is updated in the output state.
