Output State: **`a` is not empty, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to the variable `mod_y`. The initial values of `a` and `mod_x` remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` is still not empty, `mod_x` is still `num % x`, and `mod_y` is now `num % y`.
