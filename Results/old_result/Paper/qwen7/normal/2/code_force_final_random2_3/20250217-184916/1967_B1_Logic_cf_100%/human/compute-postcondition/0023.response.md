Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `ans` is increased by \((n + b) // (b * b) + (n + b) // (b * b)\)
- \(b\) is \(k + 1\) where \(k\) is the previous value of \(b\)
- \(b\) must be within the range 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\)

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\).

### Adjusting States
1. **Initial Value of \(b\)**: The initial value of \(b\) is given as \(k + 1\), where \(k\) is the previous value of \(b\). Since this is the first iteration, we assume \(k = 2\) (the minimum value of \(b\)).
2. **Range of \(b\)**: The loop runs until \(b\) reaches \(\min(n, m) + 1\).
3. **Increment of \(b\)**: In each iteration, \(b\) is incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
- At the end of the previous iteration, \(b\) was \(k + 1\).
- For the next iteration, \(b\) will be \(k + 2\).

### Updated State
- Since \(b\) is incremented by 1, the new value of \(b\) will be \(k + 2\).
- The condition for the loop to continue is that \(b\) must still be within the range 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\).

### Final Answer
State: **`ans` is increased by \((n + b) // (b * b) + (n + b) // (b * b)\), \(b\) is \(k + 2\) where \(k\) is the previous value of \(b\) and must be within the range 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\)**.

So, the updated state is:
State: **`ans` is increased by \((n + b) // (b * b) + (n + b) // (b * b)\), \(b` is \(k + 2\), \(b` must be within the range 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\)**.
