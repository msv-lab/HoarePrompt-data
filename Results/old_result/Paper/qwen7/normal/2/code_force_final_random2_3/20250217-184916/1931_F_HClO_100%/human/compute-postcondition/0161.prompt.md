Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `m` must be at least 4, `a3` is the first integer from the input for each iteration, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input for each iteration, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `m` should be at least 4 (since the loop runs `m-2` times). For each of these `m-2` iterations, `a3` is the first integer read from the input, and `l3` is the list of the remaining integers. The list `val` will contain a tuple for each iteration, with the first element being `a3` and the second element being the list `l3` as it was at the start of that iteration.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be at least 4, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations. If `l3` is not a list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be at least 4, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-3` iterations. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be at least 4, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-4` iterations. If `l3` is not equal to a list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
