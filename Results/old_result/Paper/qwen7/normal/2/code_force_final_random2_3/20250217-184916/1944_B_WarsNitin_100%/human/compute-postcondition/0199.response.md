Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`, `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list, `ans2` is a list containing the current value of `c[i]` which is `c[3]`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to -2. The values of `i`, `n`, `ans1`, `l`, and `ans2` remain unchanged as the code does not affect these variables.
