Output State: **`bets` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `ans` is a string containing the first element of `a` followed by a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of the element at index `i` of list `a` to the variable `ans`, followed by a space. Since `i` is 0, `ans` will contain the first element of `a` as a string, followed by a space. The values of `bets` and `i` remain unchanged.
