### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \) such that the first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - The modified price for the \( i \)-th bun (where \( 1 \le i \le k \)) is \( b - i + 1 \).

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified prices is \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \).
   - The profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \) is \( (n - k) \cdot a \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the profit for a given \( k \), \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes the search range from \( 0 \) to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit for \( k = mid \) and \( k = mid + 1 \).
   - It updates the search range based on which profit is higher.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \) correctly by considering the usual price \( a \).

### Analysis of the Given Code:

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The formula used in `func_1` is correct. It calculates the profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The binary search implementation in `func_2` is correct. It iteratively narrows down the range to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
  - The logic inside the binary search loop is correct and ensures that the maximum profit is found.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \) by returning the usual price \( a \) for all buns.

### Conclusion:

Given the correct implementation of both functions and the proper use of binary search to find the optimal \( k \), the provided program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
