Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `zero` is 1.
   - `one_perc` is the ceiling of \((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)\).
   - If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Given that `i` was either 0 or 1, the next value of `i` will be 1 or 2 respectively. Since `n` is at least 2, it will still be at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1.
- `n` will remain at least 2.

Since the loop condition does not depend on `zero`, `one_perc`, `zero_perc`, or `lst`, these values remain unchanged.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was 1), `n` is at least 2, `zero` is 1, `one_perc` is the ceiling of \((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)\), and if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]`**.
