Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `b` appended with `b[n - 1]`, `q` is `t`, `k` is either 2 times the original value of `k` minus 2 or 2 times the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the elements from index `n` to the end of `a`, `c` is sorted in ascending order, `req` is `k`, `l` is a list containing the element `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`; otherwise, `l` is an empty list.
