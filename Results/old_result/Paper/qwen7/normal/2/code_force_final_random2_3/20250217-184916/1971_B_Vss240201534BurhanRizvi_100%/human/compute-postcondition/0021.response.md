Output State: **`s2` is a randomly shuffled version of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))` shuffles the characters of the string `s` and assigns the shuffled string to `s2`. Since the original string `s` is input by the user, `s2` will be a random permutation of `s`. The length of `s2` will be the same as `s`, and each character in `s2` will be one of the characters from `s`, but their order will be different.
