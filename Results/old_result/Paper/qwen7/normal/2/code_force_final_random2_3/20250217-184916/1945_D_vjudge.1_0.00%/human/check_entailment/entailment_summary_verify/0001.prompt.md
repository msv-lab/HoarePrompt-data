You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
    print(resultado)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads `numero_testes`, `n`, `m`, list `a`, and list `b`. It then calls `func_1()` exactly `numero_testes` times, performing unspecified operations defined in `func_1()`. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value but ensures that `func_1()` has been called the required number of times.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to help Kirill minimize the cost of bribing people to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
   - The cost to move from position `j` to position `i` (where `j < i`) involves paying `a_j` coins to the person at position `j` and `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and `i`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The goal is to find the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions.
   - The strategy involves calculating the cost of moving Kirill from his current position to the desired positions and choosing the minimum cost.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which represent the costs `a_i` and `b_i` respectively.
   - The lists are reversed, which is unnecessary since the original order is used in the logic.
   - A variable `soma_b` is initialized to 0, and another variable `pref` is used to store the prefix sum of `b_i` values.
   - A loop iterates from `0` to `n-k-1`:
     - If `a_i < b_i`, it updates `pref` with `soma_b` and adds `a_i` to `pref`, setting `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `b_i` to `soma_b`.
   - Another loop from `n-k` to `n-1` calculates the minimum cost to move to the first `m` positions.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost.

4. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Check

1. **Logic of `func_1`:**
   - The logic seems to be flawed because it reverses the lists unnecessarily and does not correctly handle the cumulative cost calculation.
   - The main issue is in the logic where it tries to calculate the minimum cost by considering only the suffix sums of `b_i` values, which is not optimal.

2. **Optimal Solution:**
   - The optimal solution would involve maintaining a running sum of `b_i` values and using a priority queue or a similar structure to keep track of the minimum cost to move to each position.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
