Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer; `n` is the new input integer.

This means after the loop executes all its iterations (which is 2 times in this case), the list `a` will contain four elements: the initial input integer followed by three new input integers. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop, and `n` will hold the value of the last input integer provided during the loop's execution.
