Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` must be a positive integer, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an input integer greater than 0, `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2.**

This means that the variable `bxsfory` has been assigned the value of `math.ceil(y / 2)`, while the other variables (`t`, `ap`, `x`, and `y`) retain their original values.
