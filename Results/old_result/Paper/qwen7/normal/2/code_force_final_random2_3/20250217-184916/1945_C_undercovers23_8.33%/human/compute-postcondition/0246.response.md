Output State: **`c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `final` is a list containing `n`, and `final` is sorted, and `c1` is less than 50.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `n`, `final` now contains the element `n`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `c1` is still `o * 100 // n`, `final` is now a list containing `n`, and `final` is sorted (since it contains only one element), and `c1` is still less than 50.
