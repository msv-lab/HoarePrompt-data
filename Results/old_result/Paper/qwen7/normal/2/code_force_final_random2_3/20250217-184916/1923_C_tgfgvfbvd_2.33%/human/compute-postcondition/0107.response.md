Output State: **`c` is increased by `x_next` + `x`, `l` must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` + [c].**

Explanation: The code snippet `p.append(c)` appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `c` was previously increased by `x_next` + `x`, its value remains the same as before the append operation. The list `p` now contains the value of `c` as its last element. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
