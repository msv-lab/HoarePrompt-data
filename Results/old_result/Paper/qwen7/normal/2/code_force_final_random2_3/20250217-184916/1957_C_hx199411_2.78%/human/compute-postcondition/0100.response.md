Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to `k` before entering the loop.
   - The variable `k` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `k` is greater than 0.
   - `i` equals `k`.
   - `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted during the loop's final iteration.
   - `num` is 0.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `n` is the first integer inputted.
   - `k` is the second integer inputted.
   - `t` is decreased by 1.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` set to `k`, `i` must be initialized to a value that allows the loop to start. Given that `i` is already set to `k` and `k` is greater than 0, this part is already correct.
   - The number of iterations `k` must be a positive integer, which is already stated as `k > 0`.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustments are to ensure that `k` is greater than 0, which is already given, and that `i` is set to `k`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is set to `k`.
- `k` must be greater than 0 (already given).

So, the state after adjusting the necessary variables for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0**
