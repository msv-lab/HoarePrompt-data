Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` increased by `a`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`.**

In this output state, `x1` has been updated by adding `a` to its original value, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions and relationships between the variables are preserved, and the value of `t` remains the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
