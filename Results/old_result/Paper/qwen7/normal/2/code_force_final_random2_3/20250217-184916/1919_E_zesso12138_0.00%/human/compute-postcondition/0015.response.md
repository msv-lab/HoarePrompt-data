Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 2`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value obtained from `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The line `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Given that `index` was initially `index + n + 1`, after executing the line, `index` becomes `index + n + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
