You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 100 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n followed by an n x n grid of '0's and '1's. The function determines whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1. If a triangle is found, it prints 'TRIANGLE'; if a square is found, it prints 'SQUARE'. If neither shape is found, it prints an appropriate message indicating no valid shape was identified.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. The program checks if each row contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to determine a triangle. For example, consider the following grid:
```
000
011
011
```
This grid contains a triangle, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because the second and third rows both contain more than one '1'.

2. The program checks if each row contains more than one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a square. This is also not sufficient. For example, consider the following grid:
```
0000
0000
0111
0111
```
This grid contains a square, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a triangle because the first two rows contain only one '1'.

To correctly identify the shape, the program needs to check for the specific patterns of a triangle and a square. Specifically, it should:
- Check if the grid forms a triangle by verifying the pattern of increasing and then decreasing '1's in the rows.
- Check if the grid forms a square by verifying the pattern of constant '1' counts across rows.

Since the provided program does not handle these cases correctly, it is incorrect.
