Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `n` is greater than `k`.
- \(k - 1 \geq n - k + 1\).

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Since the string `'NO'` is explicitly printed without any variables or conditions affecting it, the output is straightforward.

Output: **'NO'**
