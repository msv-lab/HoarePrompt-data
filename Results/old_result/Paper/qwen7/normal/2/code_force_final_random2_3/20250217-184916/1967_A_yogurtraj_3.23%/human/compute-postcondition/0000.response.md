Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for ii in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `ii`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `ii`**: The `range(int(input()))` function will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `int(input())`. Therefore, `ii` will take values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means the input should provide a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the State**: Given the initial state of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list of integers, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `int(input())` to be a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())` to be a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must be a positive integer**
