t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. prices is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ price_i ≤ 10^9 for Alice's prices, and bonuses is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ bonus_i ≤ 10^9 for Bob's prices.
