Output State: **`low` is set, `high` is set, `mid` is set to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)**.

Explanation: The line `max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)` updates `max_profit` to be the maximum value between its current value and `profit_mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
