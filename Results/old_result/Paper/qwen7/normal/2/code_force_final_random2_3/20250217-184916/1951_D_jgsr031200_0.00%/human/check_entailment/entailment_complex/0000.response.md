Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Case When `n == k`**:
   - The program correctly identifies this case and prints "YES" followed by 1 twice, indicating that only one stall is needed with a price of 1 coin per jewel, allowing Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Case When `n < k`**:
   - The program correctly identifies this case and prints "NO", indicating that it's impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with fewer coins than required.

4. **Case When `n >= k`**:
   - The program constructs a list `costs` containing `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating the remaining coins `n`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the number of jewels bought (`h`) is at least `k`.
     - If `h < k`, it prints "NO".
     - If `h >= k`, it prints "YES", `2`, and the list `costs`, ensuring that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `n` and `k` are very large within the constraints (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
   - The logic for determining the number of stalls and their prices is sound and ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
