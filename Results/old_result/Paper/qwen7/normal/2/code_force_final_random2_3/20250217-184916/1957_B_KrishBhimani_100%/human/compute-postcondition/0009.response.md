Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `arr` is an empty list; `i` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
