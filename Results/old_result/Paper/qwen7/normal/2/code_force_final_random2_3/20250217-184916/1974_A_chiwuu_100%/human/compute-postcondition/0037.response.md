Output State: **`t` is either `b // 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input, `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` to `t * 15 - b * 4`. Since `t` is either `b // 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` will be recalculated based on these values. The other variables remain unchanged.
