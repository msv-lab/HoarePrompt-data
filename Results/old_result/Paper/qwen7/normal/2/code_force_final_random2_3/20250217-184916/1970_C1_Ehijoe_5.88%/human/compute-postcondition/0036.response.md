Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `tree` has `u` at its leftmost position.**

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(u)` appends the value of `u` to the left end of the list `tree`. Since `u` is an input integer, after executing the code, `tree` will have `u` at its leftmost position. The other variables remain unchanged.
