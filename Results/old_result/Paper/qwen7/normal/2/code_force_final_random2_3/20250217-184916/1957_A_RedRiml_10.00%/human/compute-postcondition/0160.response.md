Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of subsequent test cases, followed by t sets of inputs. Each set contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). For each set, the function performs operations based on the provided integers and returns results accordingly.**

This description indicates that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each starting with an integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by `t` sets of inputs. Each set consists of an integer `n` and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, all within specified ranges. The function processes these inputs and returns results for each set.
