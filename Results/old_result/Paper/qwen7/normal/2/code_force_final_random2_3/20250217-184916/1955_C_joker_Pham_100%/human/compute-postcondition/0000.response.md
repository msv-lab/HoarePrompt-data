Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; k is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; a is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of a is equal to n; l is 0; r is n - 1.**

This output state reflects that the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial conditions. The variables `l` and `r` are newly assigned values based on the initial value of `n`. Specifically, `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to `n - 1`.
