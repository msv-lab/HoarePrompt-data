Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the initial values of the other variables (`numCuts`, `L`, `R`, `x`, `leftover`, and `z`) are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are inputs, so they are represented as "an input integer".
