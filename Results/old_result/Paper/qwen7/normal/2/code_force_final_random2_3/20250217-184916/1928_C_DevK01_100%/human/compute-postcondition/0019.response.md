Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < w`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1
   - `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer greater than 1
   - `M` is a list containing the integers 1 and `q // i`
   - If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` includes `q // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `w`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, `w` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `w`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` must be greater than 2, and `M` is a list containing the integers 1 and `q // i`.**
