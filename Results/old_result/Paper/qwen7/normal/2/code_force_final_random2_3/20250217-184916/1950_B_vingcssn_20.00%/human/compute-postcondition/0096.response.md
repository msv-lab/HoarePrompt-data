Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints, the function does not take any parameters but seems to be designed to handle multiple test cases where `t` and `n` are integers within specified ranges (1 ≤ t ≤ 20 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 20). However, since the function definition itself does not include any parameters and only describes the constraints for `t` and `n`, it implies that the function might be part of a larger context or loop where these values are provided externally. The function itself does not process these values directly.
