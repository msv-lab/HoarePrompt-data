Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function parameters, which involve the variable `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `t` is given as `t - 2`, but this does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `n` is an input integer (though its value is not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `k` is an input integer, and it determines the number of iterations of the loop.
   - `num` is initialized to 0 and is not involved in the loop head.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `k` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `k` must be greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `i` will be 0 since the loop starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it should be 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
