Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of input strings sorted in ascending order, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers popped from the `numbers` list until it became empty.**

Explanation: The code `numbers.sort(reverse=False)` sorts the list `numbers` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, or `suma`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions. The only change is that the list `numbers` is now sorted.
