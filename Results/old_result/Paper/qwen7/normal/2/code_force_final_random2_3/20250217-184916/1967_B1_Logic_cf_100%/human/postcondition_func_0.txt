The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). It calculates the value of \( ans \) by initializing it to \( n \) and then adding to it the result of \( (n + b) // (b * b) \) for each integer \( b \) from 2 up to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \). After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \( ans \) for each case.
