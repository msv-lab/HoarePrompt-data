Output State: `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the values of `L` and `R` converge to the same value, which is 50001. This convergence occurs because the loop continues to narrow the range until the difference between `R` and `L` is no longer greater than 1. At this point, both `L` and `R` are set to the final midpoint value, which is 50001. The value of `x` becomes 50001 as it is the last calculated midpoint. The variable `numCuts` remains 0 because it is not incremented within the loop. Finally, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is the same as in the previous iterations since the loop does not modify the adjacency list `adj` or the value of `leftover` directly.
