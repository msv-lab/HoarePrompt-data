Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.
   - `sums` is updated based on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`.
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`.
     - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`.
   - `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums` if the condition is met, or it appends `sums` to itself.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 2 in the next iteration (if it hasn't reached `k + 1` yet).
   - If `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will reset to 0 in the next iteration (assuming `k` is large enough to allow this).

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was 1, it becomes 2, and if `i` was 2, it becomes 0.
   - `k` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- If `i` was 1, it becomes 2.
- If `i` was 2, it resets to 0.
- `k` remains the same.

Therefore, the new state should reflect these changes.

**State: **`i` is 2 if it was 1, or 0 if it was 2, `k` is the same as before, `sums` is updated according to the condition `i + x - 1 < n`, and `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums` if the condition is met, or it appends `sums` to itself.**

To clearly present the final state:

**State: **`i` is 2, `k` is the same as before, `sums` is updated according to the condition `i + x - 1 < n`, and `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums` if the condition is met, or it appends `sums` to itself.**
