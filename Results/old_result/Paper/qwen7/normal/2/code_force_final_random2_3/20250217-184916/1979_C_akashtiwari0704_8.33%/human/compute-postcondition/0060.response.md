Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[2]) + int(a[2])`, `a[2]` is equal to `prod // a[2]`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i]` is now `a[3]` which is updated to `prod // a[3]`. The other variables (`bets`, `i`, `sumo`, and `a[2]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
