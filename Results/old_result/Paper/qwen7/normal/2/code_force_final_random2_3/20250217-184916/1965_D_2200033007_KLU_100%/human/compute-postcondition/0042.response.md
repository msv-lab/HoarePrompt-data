Output State: `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(a)`, `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements from index `i` to the end of the list `a`, and `cts` is a list containing all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` remains as `len(a) - 1` because the loop starts with `j` from `i` to `len(a) - 1` and does not change `i` further. The variable `j` will be `len(a)` because the loop runs until `j` is less than the length of `a`, and then stops. The variable `sm` will hold the sum of all elements from index `i` to the end of the list `a` since it starts adding elements from `a[j]` in each iteration and `i` remains constant. The list `cts` will contain all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`, as each iteration appends the current cumulative sum to the list, resulting in a total of `len(a)` elements in `cts`.
