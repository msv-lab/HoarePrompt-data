Output State: **`unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, `results` list now contains 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', `k` remains unchanged, `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set of elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `relevant_b` is updated to be the set of elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_b` is a set of elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set of elements that are common between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `a` is updated to the next value in the `cases` list, `b` is updated to the next value in the `cases` list, `both` is the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.**

Explanation: The line `both = relevant_a & relevant_b` calculates the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` and assigns it to `both`. This does not change the values of any other variables. The `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` sets are already defined and contain elements from `unique_a` and `unique_b` respectively, which are less than or equal to `k`. The `both` set is updated to reflect the common elements between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
