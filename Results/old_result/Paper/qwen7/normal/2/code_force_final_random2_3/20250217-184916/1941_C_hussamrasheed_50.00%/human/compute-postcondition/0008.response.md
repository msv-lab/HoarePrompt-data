Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(t):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `s` is the string input by the user without the substring 'map'.
   - `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`.
   - `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**
