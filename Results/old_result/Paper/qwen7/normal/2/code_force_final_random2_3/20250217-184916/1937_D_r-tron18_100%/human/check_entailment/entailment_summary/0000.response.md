Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the count of such indices.
   - `preOne` is the prefix sum of `pre`.
   - `suffZero` is initialized to `[0]`.
   - `ans` is initialized to a list of zeros of length `n`.

2. **Processing the String**:
   - For each position `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
     - If `s1[i]` is '>', calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the positions of '>' and '<'.
     - If `s1[i]` is '<', update `suffZero` and recalculate the time similarly.

3. **Calculations**:
   - The calculations involve using the prefix sums (`preOne`) and suffix sums (`suffZero`) to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The function uses `func_1` to perform specific arithmetic operations on these prefix and suffix sums.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles different scenarios based on the relative counts of '>' and '<' characters and their positions.

Given the detailed execution summary and the problem description, the logic in `func_2` appears to correctly implement the rules for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid. The use of prefix and suffix sums, along with the handling of edge cases, suggests that the function will produce the correct results for each query.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the logical flow of the code, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
