Output State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Here, `s` is defined as the minimum of `m` and `k`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `l`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
