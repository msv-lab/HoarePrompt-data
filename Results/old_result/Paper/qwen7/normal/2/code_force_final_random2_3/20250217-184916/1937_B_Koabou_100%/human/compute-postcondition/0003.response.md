Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list containing one element which is the input integer; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code appends the input integer to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, after appending the input integer, `a` now contains one element, which is the input integer. The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
