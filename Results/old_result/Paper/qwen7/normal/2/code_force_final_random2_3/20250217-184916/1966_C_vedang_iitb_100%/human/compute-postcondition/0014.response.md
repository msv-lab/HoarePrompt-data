Output State: **`tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with the first element removed, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`, and `mexsize` is 3.**

Explanation: The variable `mexsize` was originally set to 2. The code increments `mexsize` by 1, making its new value 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
