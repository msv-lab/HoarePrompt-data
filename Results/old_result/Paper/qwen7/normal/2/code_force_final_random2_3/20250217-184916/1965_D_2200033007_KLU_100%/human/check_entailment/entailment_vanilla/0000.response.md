Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
This function calculates all possible subarray sums of the input array `a` and returns them sorted.
- It iterates through all possible starting points (`i`) and ending points (`j`) of subarrays, computing their sums and storing them in `cts`.
- This part is correct and works as expected.

#### Function 2: `func_2(cts)`
This function aims to identify unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
- It iterates through the sorted list `cts` and keeps track of the last seen value in `odds`. If the current value is the same as the last seen value, it removes the last value from `odds`.
- This logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the removal of duplicates. For instance, if the list is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, the function will incorrectly remove `2` and `3`.

#### Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`
This function attempts to reconstruct the original palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums stored in `odds`.
- It initializes an array `a` of length `n` filled with zeros.
- It then tries to fill the middle of the array first and then symmetrically fill outwards.
- The logic for filling the array is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the reconstruction of the palindrome. For example, if the middle element is not correctly identified, the resulting array won't be a palindrome.

#### Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`
This function aims to find the last unique subarray sum by comparing the last elements of two lists.
- It simply pops the last elements from both lists until they are no longer equal, then returns the last element of `bigList`.
- This function is not used in the main logic and seems unnecessary.

### Correctness Check

Given the analysis above, the functions `func_2` and `func_3` contain logical errors that would prevent the program from correctly recovering the palindrome array `a`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program is incorrect due to the flaws in `func_2` and `func_3`.

**Correctness: False**
