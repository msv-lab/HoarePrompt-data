Output State: **`i` is `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums, `totalOne` is `ol`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to itself, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2], `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation:
- The code updates `suffZero` by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to itself.
- It calculates `zeroInd` as `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`.
- It calculates `oneInd` as `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. However, since `func_1` is not defined, `oneInd` remains as `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
