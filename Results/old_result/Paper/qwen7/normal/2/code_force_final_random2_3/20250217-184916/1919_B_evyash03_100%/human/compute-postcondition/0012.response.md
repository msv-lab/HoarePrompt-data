Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, meaning `count` is equal to the length of the string `expression`. The string `expression` remains unchanged, and `count` holds the total number of '+' characters in `expression`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `count` will hold the total number of '+' characters in the string `expression`, while the string itself remains the same as it was initially.
