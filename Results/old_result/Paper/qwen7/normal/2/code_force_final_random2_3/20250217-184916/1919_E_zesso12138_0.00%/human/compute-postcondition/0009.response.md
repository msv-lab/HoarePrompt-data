Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers.**

This means that `data` remains unchanged, `index` is updated to `index + 1`, `n` is set to the integer value of `data[index]`, and `p` is a list of integers derived from the substring of `data` starting at `index` and ending at `index + n - 1`.
