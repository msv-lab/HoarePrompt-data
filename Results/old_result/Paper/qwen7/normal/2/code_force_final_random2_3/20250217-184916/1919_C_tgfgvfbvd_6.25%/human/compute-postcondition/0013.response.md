Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for y in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `y` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `y` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - The value of `l[1]` is assigned to `b`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `y` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `y` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `y` must be incremented to 2 (since it starts from 1 and the loop condition is `y < n`).
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, which is greater than 1.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `y` will be 2.
   - `n` remains the same and is still greater than 1.
   - The value of `l[1]` is already assigned to `b` and does not change within the loop.
   - The break condition remains the same, but since we are adjusting the loop head variables, we don't need to explicitly mention the break condition here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`y` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**.
