Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `freq[(x - (num % x)) % x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 0.**

Explanation: The line `freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0` sets the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` to 0. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
