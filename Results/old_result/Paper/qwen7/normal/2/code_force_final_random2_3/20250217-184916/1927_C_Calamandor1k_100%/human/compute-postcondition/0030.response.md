Output State: **`unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b` and now also includes elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list now contains 'YES'; `k` remains unchanged; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set of elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`.**

Explanation: The code `only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b` creates a new set `only_a` which consists of elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`. All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their values or conditions.
