Output State: **`c` is the initial value of `c` plus `x`, `l` contains at least one element, and `p` is a list containing the value of `c`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `c` is initially the sum of its initial value and `x`, and `l` must contain at least one element (though `l` itself is not affected by this line of code), the only change is that `p` now contains `c`.
