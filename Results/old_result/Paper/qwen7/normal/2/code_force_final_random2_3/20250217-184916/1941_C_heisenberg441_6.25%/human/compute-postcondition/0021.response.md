Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `s.find('pie') != -1`. This means the loop continues as long as the substring 'pie' is found within `s`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `ans` is 5
   - `s` contains the substring 'pi'

3. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `s.find('pie')` must not return `-1`, meaning 'pie' must still be a substring of `s`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `s` currently contains 'pi', but not necessarily 'pie', we need to ensure that 'pie' remains a substring of `s` for the loop to continue.
   - We cannot directly modify `ans` because it is not part of the loop condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `s` such that it still contains the substring 'pie'.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 5, `s` must contain the substring 'pie'**
