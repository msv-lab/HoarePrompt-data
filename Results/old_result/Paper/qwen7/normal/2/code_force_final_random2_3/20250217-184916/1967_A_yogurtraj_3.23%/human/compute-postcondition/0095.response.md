Output State: **`ii` is 1, `i` is 7, `n` is an input integer followed by another integer (separated by space), `k` is an input integer, `r` is `a[7]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `ii`, `i`, `r`, and `rem` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `y` is updated to `n - 3`, where `n` is now an input integer.
