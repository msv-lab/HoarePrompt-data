Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional we were in.
