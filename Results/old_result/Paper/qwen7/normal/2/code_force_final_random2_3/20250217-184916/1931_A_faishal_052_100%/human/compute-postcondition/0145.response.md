Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26` depending on the initial value of `lex`, if `lex` was less than 27, `arr` contains the elements [1, 1] or [1, 26] or [26, 1] or [26], if `lex` was 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged and contains the element 1; `arr` now contains the elements [26, 1] or [26, 26]**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, `arr` could initially contain `[1, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[26]`. After appending `26`, the possible states of `arr` are `[26, 1]` or `[26, 26]`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
