Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether each element in `a` is not greater than or equal to the previous one starting from index 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, and the condition `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating if the elements in `new` from index 0 to len(new)-1 are in non-decreasing order. Both `check_all_new` and `new_all` will be true if the corresponding conditions are met during the execution of the if or else part, and the loops or if statements will be broken out of in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `check_all_new` remains unchanged, `new_all` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `check_all_new` remains unchanged, `new_all` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
