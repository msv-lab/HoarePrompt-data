You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer; `n` is the new input integer.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which, based on the given information, is 2 times), the list `a` will contain four elements. The first element is the initial input integer provided in the initial state. The next two elements are the new input integers provided during the first iteration of the loop, and the fourth element is the new input integer provided during the second iteration of the loop. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last input integer provided, which is the input for the second iteration.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer, `n` is the length of the concatenated string formed by `a[0]` and `a[1]` minus one, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the `x-th` element of `a[1]`, `x` is the last index `i` that satisfied either of the conditions in the loop, and `y` is equal to `x`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `n` will be the length of the concatenated string formed by `a[0]` and `a[1]` minus one. The variable `s` will contain the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the `x-th` element of `a[1]`, where `x` is the last index `i` that satisfied either of the conditions in the loop. The variables `t`, `a`, and `y` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: y is equal to x, i is equal to n, and t is equal to -1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: None
    print(t)
    #This is printed: -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings `a_{1}` and `a_{2}` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the comparison of these two binary strings for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
