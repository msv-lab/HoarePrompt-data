Based on the initial state provided:

- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is `i`

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Here, `v1` is explicitly stated to be 0, so it will be printed as `0`.

The value of `v2` is given as `i`. Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it will be substituted for `v2` in the print statement.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with `v1` and `v2` as described.

Output: **? 0 0 i i**
