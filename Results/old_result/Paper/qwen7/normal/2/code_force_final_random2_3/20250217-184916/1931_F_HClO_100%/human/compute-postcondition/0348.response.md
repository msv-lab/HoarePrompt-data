Output State: **`val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**

The code initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, both to -1. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the values of all the other variables as they were initially, while updating `idx1` and `idx2` to -1.
