State: **`index` is 1, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `path` is a string, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The loop `for _ in range(t):` depends on the value of `t`.
- `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The other variables (`index`, `n`, `path`, `data`, and `results`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.
