Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This is done correctly using a loop that iterates `t` times.

2. **String Permutation Generation**: For each test case, the program generates a random permutation of the input string `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. This ensures that the generated string `s2` is a valid permutation of `s`.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - If the original string `s` is different from the generated permutation `s2`, the program prints 'Yes' followed by `s2`.
   - If the original string `s` is the same as the generated permutation `s2`, the program prints 'No'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the string `s` consists of all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa" or "hhhhhhh"). In such cases, generating a different permutation is impossible, and the program correctly outputs 'No'.
   - The program also handles the case where the string `s` has unique characters, ensuring that a different permutation can always be generated.

5. **Randomness and Validity**:
   - The use of `random.sample` ensures that the generated permutations are valid and random, which meets the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
