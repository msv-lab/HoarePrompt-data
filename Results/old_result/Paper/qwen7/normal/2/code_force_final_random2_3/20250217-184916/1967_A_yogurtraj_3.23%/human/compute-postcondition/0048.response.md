Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is either 0 or not 0, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is -1, `ii` is 0**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the initial state of `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, and `k` is either 0 or not 0, these values remain unchanged except that now `n` and `k` have specific integer values. The value of `r` remains dependent on the updated `n` and `k`, and the other variables (`rem`, `y`, `ii`) are not affected by this operation.
