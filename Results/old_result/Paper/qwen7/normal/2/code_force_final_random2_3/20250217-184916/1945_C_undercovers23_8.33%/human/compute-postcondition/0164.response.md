Output State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, `final` is an empty list of sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`; `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`, and `c1` is less than 50; `final` now contains the integer `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `n`, `final` now contains the single element `n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
