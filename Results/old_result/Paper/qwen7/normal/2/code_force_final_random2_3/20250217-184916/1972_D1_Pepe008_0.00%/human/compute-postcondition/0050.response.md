Output State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` must be at least 3, `i` is `a`, `suma` is the sum of `x` for each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, and `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration.**

Explanation: The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `info`. The other variables (`b`, `i`, `suma`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
