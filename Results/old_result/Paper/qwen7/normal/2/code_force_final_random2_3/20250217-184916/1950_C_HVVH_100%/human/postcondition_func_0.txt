The function processes a series of times in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It prints each converted time and the corresponding AM/PM designation. After processing all inputs, it sets the counter `n` to 0 and updates the `day` variable to either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the final hour value. The function does not return any value but modifies the `day` and `n` variables and prints the converted times.
