Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `path` is a string, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads all input from standard input at once and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and a new variable `data` is created, which contains the split input as a list of strings. The original `path` variable is now a string, and the input has been processed into the `data` list.
