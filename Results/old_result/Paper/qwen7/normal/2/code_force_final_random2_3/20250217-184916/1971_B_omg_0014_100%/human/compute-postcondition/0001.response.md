State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `n`, and the implicit variable representing the range start (which is always 0).
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `n > 0` must be satisfied because `range(n)` generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
4. The value of `t` (an integer between 1 and 1000) does not affect the loop's execution condition and can remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
