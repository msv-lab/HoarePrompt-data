Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the input integer and the second element is the new input integer.
- `n` is an input integer.

### Loop Statement
```python
for _ in range(2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop runs exactly 2 times because of `range(2)`.
- There are no variables `i` or `n` directly involved in the loop head; instead, the loop runs a fixed number of times (2 times).

### State at the End of Previous Iteration
Since the loop runs a fixed number of times, the state does not change based on the loop variable or condition. Instead, it changes based on the loop body execution, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no internal state changes within the loop.

### Adjusting the State
- Since the loop runs a fixed number of times, there are no conditions or variables from the loop head that need adjustment.
- The state remains as it was at the beginning of the loop.

### Final State
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the input integer and the second element is the new input integer, `n` is an input integer**
