Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The function calculates `c` as the number of times it finds an element greater than both `a` and `b`. However, this does not align with the definition of the penalty \( p(b) \), which counts the number of indices \( i \) where \( b_i < b_{i+1} \).

2. **Subsequences Splitting Logic**: The function attempts to find a way to split the array into two subsequences but does not ensure that the penalty is minimized. It uses `a` and `b` to track some values but does not properly handle the splitting logic to minimize the penalty.

3. **No Proper Handling of Subsequences**: The function does not explicitly create or consider subsequences \( s \) and \( t \) in a way that would minimize the total penalty \( p(s) + p(t) \). Instead, it seems to be trying to find a pattern in the array that might help in minimizing the penalty, which is not the correct approach.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one should sort the array and then split it into two parts such that the penalty is minimized. The optimal strategy is to place the smallest elements in one subsequence and the larger elements in the other, ensuring that the number of increasing pairs in each subsequence is minimized.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        penalty = 0
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if l[i] < l[i + 1]:
                penalty += 1
        print(penalty)
```

This function sorts the array and then counts the number of increasing pairs, which directly gives the minimum possible penalty.
