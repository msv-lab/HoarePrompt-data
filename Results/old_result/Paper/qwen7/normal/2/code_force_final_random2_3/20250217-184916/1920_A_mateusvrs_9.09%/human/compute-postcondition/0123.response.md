Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input and its current value is 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.**

Explanation: The code `bx = max(x, bx)` assigns to `bx` the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`. Since `x` is an integer from the input and its current value is 1, and without knowing the previous value of `bx`, `bx` will be updated to the maximum of 1 and the previous value of `bx`. The other variables (`n` and `a`) remain unchanged.
