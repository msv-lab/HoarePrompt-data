Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the next element in the `results` list.
- `results` is the same list.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Here, `i` is the next element in the `results` list. Since `i` is explicitly described as the next element in the `results` list, we can directly use this information to determine the output.

Output: **the next element in the results list**
