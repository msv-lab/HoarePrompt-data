Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and now t is set to the integer value input by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 5⋅10^4, after executing the code, `t` will be updated to the integer value provided by the user, which must still fall within the specified range. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
