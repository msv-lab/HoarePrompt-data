Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is an empty string.**

The code `res = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
