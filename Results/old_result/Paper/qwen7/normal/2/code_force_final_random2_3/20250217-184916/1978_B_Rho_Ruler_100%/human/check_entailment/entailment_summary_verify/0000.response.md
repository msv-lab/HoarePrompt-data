### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the provided problem description and function summaries.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- Bob has `n` buns.
- The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
- Bob can choose an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)) to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins for the `i-th` bun.
- The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
- The goal is to maximize the profit.

#### Function Summaries:
1. **func_1**: This function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula:
   \[
   \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
   \]
2. **func_2**: This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit and returns the maximum profit.

#### Code Analysis:
- **func_1**:
  - The formula used in `func_1` is correct and matches the problem description.
  - It correctly calculates the profit for a given `k`.

- **func_2**:
  - The binary search approach is used to find the optimal `k`.
  - The function iteratively narrows down the range of `k` using the `low` and `high` pointers.
  - For each midpoint `mid`, it calculates the profit using `func_1` and compares it with the profit for `mid + 1`.
  - The function updates the `max_profit` accordingly and adjusts the `low` and `high` pointers based on the comparison.

#### Validation:
- The binary search approach in `func_2` ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently.
- The profit calculation in `func_1` is accurate and follows the problem description.
- The function handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases where `k` could be 0 or `n`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit under the given constraints and rules. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
