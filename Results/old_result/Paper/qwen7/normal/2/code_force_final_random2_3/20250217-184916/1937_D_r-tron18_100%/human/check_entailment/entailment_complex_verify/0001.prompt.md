You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now `-1`. At this point, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, but it has been reduced by the number of iterations (which is `n`). `totalOne` is 0 because it has been decremented until it reaches 0. `suffZero` is a list containing only 0, as it was appended to in each iteration but never removed from. `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, as no non-zero values were added to it within the loop since the conditions for updating `ans` were not met in any iteration.
    #
    #In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` has reached `-1`, indicating the loop has completed. The list `preOne` has been reduced to a size of `n` minus the number of iterations, `totalOne` is 0, `suffZero` contains only the initial 0, and `ans` remains a list of zeros of length `n`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It processes the string to compute a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element is calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in `s1`. After processing, it prints a list of zeros of length `n`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates a value based on the input array `arr` and an integer `times`.
   - The formula `arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]` seems to be calculating the difference between the last element and an element at a specific index.
   - However, the logic behind this calculation is unclear without more context. It appears to be part of a larger algorithm but isn't directly relevant to the main function `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` and computes the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - The function uses several lists (`pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`) to store intermediate results.
   - The logic involves iterating through the string `s1` in reverse order and using these lists to compute the time taken for each cell.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The function initializes `pre` with indices where the character is `'>` and calculates `totalOne` (the count of `'>`).
   - It then iterates through the string in reverse order, updating the answers based on whether the current character is `'>` or `'<'`.
   - For each character, it calculates the time taken using the precomputed values in `preOne` and `suffZero`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre` is correctly initialized with indices where the character is `'>'`.
   - `totalOne` is correctly calculated as the count of `'>` in the string.

2. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - The loop iterates through the string in reverse order, which is correct for computing the time taken for each cell.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly updates the answers based on the current character and the precomputed values.

3. **Calculations**:
   - The calculations involving `preOne` and `suffZero` are used to determine the time taken for each cell.
   - The formulas used in the calculations seem to be derived from the problem statement and are logically consistent.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles both cases where the current character is `'>` and `'<'`.
   - The logic for handling these cases is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the function `func_2` correctly implements the logic to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The use of precomputed values (`preOne` and `suffZero`) and the iterative approach ensures that the solution is efficient and correct.
