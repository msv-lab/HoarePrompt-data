Output State: **The list `li` contains 500 elements, each of which is equal to `a + k * c + 499 * d`. The variable `n` is 500, `h` ranges from 0 to 499, and both `k` and `d` retain their initial values.**

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations (from 0 to 499), the list `li` will contain 500 elements. Each element in the list is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `h` takes on every integer value from 0 to 499. Therefore, the last value added to the list is `a + k * c + 499 * d`. The values of `a`, `k`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `n` is set to 500, matching the upper limit of the loop's range.
