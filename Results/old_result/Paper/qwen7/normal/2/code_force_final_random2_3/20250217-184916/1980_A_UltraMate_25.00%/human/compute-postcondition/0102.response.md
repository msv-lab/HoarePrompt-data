Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 'B'
   - `hmp` is {'A': 'B', 'B': 'C', 'C': 'D', 'D': 'E', 'E': 'F', 'F': 'G'}
   - The postcondition states that if `hmp[i]` (which is 'C') is less than `m`, then `ans` is `m - 'C'`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the keys of `hmp`.
   - The current value of `i` is 'B'.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be the next key in `hmp` after 'B'.
   - The next key in `hmp` after 'B' is 'C'.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is determined by the loop, it will change to 'C' in the next iteration.
   - The dictionary `hmp` does not change within the loop head, so its state remains the same.
   - The variable `ans` is determined by the postcondition based on the current value of `i` and `hmp[i]`. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we do not need to change `ans`.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 'C'
   - `hmp` remains {'A': 'B', 'B': 'C', 'C': 'D', 'D': 'E', 'E': 'F', 'F': 'G'}

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`i` is 'C', `hmp` is {'A': 'B', 'B': 'C', 'C': 'D', 'D': 'E', 'E': 'F', 'F': 'G'}**
