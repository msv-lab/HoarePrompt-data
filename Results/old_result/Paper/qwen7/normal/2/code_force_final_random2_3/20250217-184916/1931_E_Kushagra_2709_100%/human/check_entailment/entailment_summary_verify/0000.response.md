### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided functions and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Anna and Sasha take turns.
- Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number.
- Sasha concatenates two chosen numbers and removes one from the list.
- The game ends when only one number remains, and Sasha wins if it is at least \(10^m\).

#### Provided Functions:
1. **zerocnts(num)**:
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.
   - It is used to determine how many zeros are at the end of a number, which is not directly relevant to the game logic.

2. **func_1(n, m, nums)**:
   - This function calculates the total length of the numbers in the list after removing the largest number of trailing zeros.
   - It then checks if this total length is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\).
   - If true, it returns "Sasha"; otherwise, it returns "Anna".

#### Analysis:
1. **Relevance to Game Logic**:
   - The `zerocnts` function is not used in `func_1` and does not contribute to the game logic.
   - The `func_1` function does not simulate the game process, as it does not account for the turns taken by Anna and Sasha, nor does it consider the strategic decisions required to win.

2. **Game Process Simulation**:
   - The function `func_1` does not simulate the game process where Anna and Sasha take turns.
   - It does not handle the concatenation of numbers by Sasha or the reversal of digits by Anna.
   - It also does not consider the optimal strategy for both players, which is crucial for determining the winner.

3. **Optimal Play Consideration**:
   - The problem requires optimal play, meaning both players make the best possible moves to ensure their victory.
   - The provided functions do not account for this, as they do not simulate the game process or the strategic decisions required.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided functions do not correctly implement the game logic and do not account for the optimal play required to determine the winner.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game process or account for the optimal play required to determine the winner.
