#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]

    #State: After all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of list `a` minus 1. The variable `f` will be 1 if there was at least one instance where `a[i] < b[i]` during the loop's execution; otherwise, `f` will be 0. The lists `a` and `b` will have their elements potentially swapped based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`, if `f` was set to 1 due to `a[i] < b[i]`, the elements at those indices in `a` and `b` will be swapped if `a[i] > b[i]`. Otherwise, the elements will remain unchanged.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of list `a` minus 1, which means `i` is now 2 (since it has been incremented through the loop three times). The value of `f` remains 0 because no instances of `a[i] < b[i]` were found during the loop's execution. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as no swapping occurred since `f` never became 1.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` being 2, `len(b)` still being 3, `a` remaining as `[1, 2, 3]`, `b` remaining as `[4, 5, 6]`, and `f` remaining 0.
    print()
    #This is printed: None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, where both strings represent integers of the same length consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It then compares corresponding characters in these strings. If a character in `x` is less than the corresponding character in `y`, it swaps them. This process continues until the end of the strings. Finally, it prints the modified string `a` followed by the original string `b`. The function does not return any value.
