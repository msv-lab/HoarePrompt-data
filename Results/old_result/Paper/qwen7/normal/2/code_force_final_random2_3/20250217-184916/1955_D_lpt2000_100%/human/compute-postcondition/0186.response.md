Postcondition: `m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 0. `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and either `E[out_aa]` is not decreased by 1 or `D[out_aa]` is not decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is not increased by 1.
