Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 32, and all t strings across all test cases are distinct.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 32 inclusive. The condition that all t strings across all test cases are distinct remains unchanged.
