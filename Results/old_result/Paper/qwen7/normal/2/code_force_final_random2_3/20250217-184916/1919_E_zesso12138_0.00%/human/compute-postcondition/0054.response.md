Output State: **`j` is 2 * `n`, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of 2 * `n` + 1 zeros where the element at index `j - 1` is updated to (`new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code updates the element at index `j - 1` in the list `new_dp` by adding `dp[j]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Since `j` is defined as `2 * n`, the specific index being updated is `2 * n - 1`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
