You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: s is a list containing all the integer values of each character in sChar, and i is the last character in sChar.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is 11, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is 11, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
    #
    #Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop continues to increment `left` until it reaches the end of the string `s` or encounters a '1'. Given that `left` is 11 after the third iteration and the loop condition `left < len(s)` must hold, `left` will continue to increment until it reaches the length of `s`. This means `left` will be equal to the length of `s`, making `right` also equal to the length of `s` since the loop terminates when `left` equals `right`. 
    #
    #Since the loop increments `cost` by `right - left + 1` each time it swaps elements, and `right` is now equal to `len(s)`, the final value of `cost` will be `len(s) - 11 + 1 = len(s) - 10`. Given that `left` is 11, the length of `s` must be at least 11 for the loop to have completed its iterations. Therefore, `cost` will be `11` if the length of `s` is exactly 11, and it will increase accordingly if the length of `s` is greater than 11. The other variables remain unchanged from their final state after the third iteration.
    return cost
    #The program returns a cost value which is 11 if the length of `s` is exactly 11, and increases by 1 for each additional character beyond 11 in the length of `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `sChar`, which is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000. If the length of `sChar` is exactly 11, the function returns 11. For each additional character beyond 11, the cost increases by 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a cost value which is 11 if the length of `s` is exactly 11, and increases by 1 for each additional character beyond 11 in the length of `s`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
