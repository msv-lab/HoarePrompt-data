Output State: **`s` is now the minimum of `m` and `k`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t + s + s`, `k` is decreased by `s`, `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t), `t` is increased by `s`.**

Explanation: 
- `t` was initially `t + s`, and now it is further incremented by `s`, so `t` becomes `t + s + s`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `t` which is updated as described.
