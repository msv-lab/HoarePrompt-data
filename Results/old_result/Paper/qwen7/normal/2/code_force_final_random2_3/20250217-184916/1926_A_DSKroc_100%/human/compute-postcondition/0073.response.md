Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` (the current character) and `s` (the string).

2. **Understand the Postconditions**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `ac` is 2 if the current character `i` is 'A', and `bc` is 1 if the previous character was not 'A'.
   - `ac` is 1 if the current character `i` is not 'A', and `bc` is 2 if the previous character was 'A'.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the current character, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `ac` and `bc` will depend on the current character `i` and the previous character.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `s` remains the same as it is the entire string and does not change within the loop.
- `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
- `ac` and `bc` will be determined based on the new `i` and the previous value of `i`.

Since `i` is the current character and it changes with each iteration, we need to consider the transition from the previous `i` to the next `i`.

Assuming the previous character `i` was 'A' (since `bc` was 1), the next character `i` could either be 'A' or not 'A'. Let's consider both cases:

### Case 1: Previous `i` was 'A'
- If the next `i` is 'A':
  - `ac` will be 2 (since the current character is 'A').
  - `bc` will be 1 (since the previous character was 'A').

### Case 2: Previous `i` was 'A'
- If the next `i` is not 'A':
  - `ac` will be 1 (since the current character is not 'A').
  - `bc` will be 2 (since the previous character was 'A').

Since we don't know the exact next character `i`, we can represent the state in a general form:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ac` is 2 if the next character `i` is 'A', and `bc` is 1 if the previous character was 'A'. Otherwise, `ac` is 1 if the next character `i` is not 'A', and `bc` is 2 if the previous character was 'A'.**

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume the next character `i` is 'A':

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ac` is 2, and `bc` is 1.**

If the next character `i` is not 'A':

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ac` is 1, and `bc` is 2.**

For the sake of providing a single answer, we can generalize:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ac` is 2 if the next character `i` is 'A', and `bc` is 1 if the previous character was 'A'. Otherwise, `ac` is 1 if the next character `i` is not 'A', and `bc` is 2 if the previous character was 'A'.**

Thus, the final state can be represented as:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ac` is 2 if the next character `i` is 'A', and `bc` is 1 if the previous character was 'A'. Otherwise, `ac` is 1 if the next character `i` is not 'A', and `bc` is 2 if the previous character was 'A'.**
