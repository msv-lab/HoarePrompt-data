Postcondition: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, and `i` is `len(num) - 1`. If the character at index `i` in `num` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` is '0', no action is taken regarding `i` or `num`.
