Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k-1`, `t` will be equal to `2^(k-1) % MOD`, and `ans` will be equal to the sum of `t` for each iteration from 0 to `k-1` modulo `MOD`.

To explain further:
- The loop runs `k-1` times, incrementing `i` from 0 to `k-2`.
- In each iteration, `t` is updated to `2 * t % MOD`.
- `ans` is updated by adding the current value of `t` to it and taking modulo `MOD` after each addition.
- After `k-1` iterations, `i` will be `k-1`, `t` will be `2^(k-1) % MOD`, and `ans` will be the cumulative sum of `2^i % MOD` for `i` from 0 to `k-2`, all taken modulo `MOD`.
