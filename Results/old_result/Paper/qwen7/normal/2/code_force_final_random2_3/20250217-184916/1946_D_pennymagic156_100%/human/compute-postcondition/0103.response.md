Output State: **`a` is a list where each element has been updated by performing an XOR operation with `val`; `op` is the final value of the XOR of `val >> i & 1` for all iterations; `t` is now an empty list; `ai` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `a, t = t, []` swaps the values of `a` and `t`. After the swap, `a` becomes the current value of `t`, which is an empty list `[]`, and `t` becomes the current value of `a`. All other variables (`op` and `ai`) retain their previous values.
