Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `val` is the first element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of `val`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, while the values of `a`, `val`, and `op` remain unchanged from their initial states.
