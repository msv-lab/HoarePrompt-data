You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), and x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q).
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q); `M` is a list. If `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains `[w]`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` will be `w + 1`, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer, and `M` will contain all integers from 1 up to and including `w`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `w + 1`. During each iteration, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` itself or `q // i` is added to the list `M`. Since the loop processes all divisors of `q` up to `w`, `M` will include all integers from 1 up to and including `w`.
    return M
    #The program returns a list `M` containing all integers from 1 up to and including the square root `w` of `q`, where `q` is a perfect square greater than 1 and `w` is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. `q` is an integer representing the position in the line, and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling. The function returns a list `M` containing all integers from 1 up to and including the square root `w` of `q`, where `q` is a perfect square greater than 1 and `w` is an integer.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `M` containing all integers from 1 up to and including the square root `w` of `q`, where `q` is a perfect square greater than 1 and `w` is an integer.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
