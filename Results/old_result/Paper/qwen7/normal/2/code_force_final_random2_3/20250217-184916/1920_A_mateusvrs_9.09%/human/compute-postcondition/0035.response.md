Output State: `n` must be equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing all unique `x` values that were inputs to the loop, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values that were inputs to the loop when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values that were inputs to the loop when `a` was 1, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided to the loop during its final iteration.
