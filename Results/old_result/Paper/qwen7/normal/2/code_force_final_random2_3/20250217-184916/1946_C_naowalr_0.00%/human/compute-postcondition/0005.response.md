Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings, and then converts these strings to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting integers are assigned to variables `a` and `b`. The initial conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
