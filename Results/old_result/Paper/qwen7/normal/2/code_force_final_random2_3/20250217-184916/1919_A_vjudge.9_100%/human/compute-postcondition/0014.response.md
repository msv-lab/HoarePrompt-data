Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` is not explicitly defined and is not used in the print statement, its value does not affect the output.
- `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd.
- `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user after the absolute difference check.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement will simply print the string "Alice" regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, or `t`.

Output: **Alice**
