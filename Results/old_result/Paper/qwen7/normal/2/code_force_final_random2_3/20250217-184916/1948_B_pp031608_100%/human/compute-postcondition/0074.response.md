Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers that has been modified according to the conditions in the loop.
- `ans` is False if any condition within the loop caused it to be set to False; otherwise, `ans` remains True.

Given that the loop has completed all its iterations (since `i` is now 0 and the loop runs from `m-1` down to 0), and considering the value of `m` is 0, the loop would have effectively run from 0 down to 0, meaning it didn't execute any iterations.

The value of `ans` is determined by whether any condition within the loop caused it to be set to False. Since no iterations were performed, the value of `ans` remains as it was initialized, which is True unless explicitly changed to False during the loop.

Therefore, `ans` is True.

The `print` statement will then evaluate the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]`. Since `ans` is True, the index `[ans]` evaluates to 1 (because Python uses 0-based indexing).

Thus, the print statement will output `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
