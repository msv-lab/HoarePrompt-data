### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing the results of bitwise OR operations on pairs of indices.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The permutation \(p\) is fixed and unknown.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d".
   - The response to each query is either "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - After determining the indices, we need to output "! i j".

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes `v1` to 0 and `g` to 0.
   - It performs a series of queries to find a candidate index `v1` that seems to maximize the bitwise OR when paired with itself.
   - Then, it uses another set of queries to find a different index `prev` that maximizes the bitwise OR when paired with `v1`.
   - Finally, it outputs the pair of indices `prev` and `v1`.

4. **Query Strategy**:
   - The first loop (`for i in range(1, n)`): This loop compares \(p_0 \mid p_i\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\). If the result is "<", it updates `v1` to \(i\). This step aims to find an index that, when OR'd with itself, gives a higher value compared to \(p_0 \mid p_i\).
   - The second loop (`for i in range(1, n)`): This loop compares \(p_{v1} \mid i\) with \(p_{v1} \mid prev\) for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\). If the result is ">", it updates `prev` to \(i\). This step aims to find an index that, when OR'd with \(v1\), gives a higher value compared to \(prev\).

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The strategy used in the function is a valid approach to find the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR. By focusing on maximizing the bitwise OR, the function narrows down the potential candidates for the indices that maximize the XOR.
   - The function adheres to the constraint of making at most \(3n\) queries.
   - The final output of the indices is correct based on the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided function correctly implements the logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized within the allowed constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
