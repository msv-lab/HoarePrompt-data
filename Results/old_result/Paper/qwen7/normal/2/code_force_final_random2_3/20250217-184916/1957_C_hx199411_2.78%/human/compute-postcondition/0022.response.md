Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 3 or 5, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `c` and `r` are assigned the values from the input split separated by a space.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Given that `num` was either 2 or 4, after executing `num += 1`, `num` will now be either 3 or 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
