Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 21, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` using a list comprehension where each element is calculated as \(1\) left-shifted by the index `i` for `i` in the range from `0` to `20`. This results in a list of powers of `2` starting from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). The values of `i`, `idx`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
