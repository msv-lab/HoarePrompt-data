Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is the input value from the user.
- `s2` is a random permutation of `s`.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and is decremented by 1 from the previous value.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement will always print the string `'No'`, regardless of the values of `s`, `s2`, or `n`.

Output: **No**
