Postcondition: `aa` is a list such that `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least one element. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0 - 1, and `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, with `C[out_aa]` increased by 1.
