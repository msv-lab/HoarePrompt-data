Output State: `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, and `v2` is `n-1`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. After each iteration, `v1` and `v2` are set to the current value of `i`. Since the loop continues to run as long as `i` is less than `n`, the final values of both `v1` and `v2` will be `n-1` when the loop completes all its iterations. The variable `g` remains unchanged at 0, and the value of `v1` is updated based on user input during each iteration, but since the input is always '<' leading to no change in `v1`, the final value of `v1` will also be `n-1`.
