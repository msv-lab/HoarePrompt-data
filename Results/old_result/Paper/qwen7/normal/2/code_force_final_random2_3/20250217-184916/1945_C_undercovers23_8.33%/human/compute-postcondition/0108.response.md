Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 2, and if `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0' and `zero` is 1; otherwise, `i` is 1 and the first character of `s` is not '0', `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `zero_perc` as the ceiling of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`. Since `zero` is either 1 (if `i` is 0) or 0 (if `i` is 1), and `i` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` will be either 100 (if `i` is 0) or 0 (if `i` is 1). The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `zero` remain unchanged.
