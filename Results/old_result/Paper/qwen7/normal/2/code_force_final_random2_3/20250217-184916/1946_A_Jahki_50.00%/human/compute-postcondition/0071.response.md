Postcondition: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is 0, and `b` is a sorted list of integers. If `num2` is greater than 10000, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues to increment `ma` and increase the count in `b[ma]` until `new_median` becomes greater than `median`. After all iterations, the final state will be: `b` is a sorted list of integers, `ma` is the last index where `new_median` was updated, `op` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `new_median` is the value at index `ma` of list `b`, and `b[ma]` is the count of the median value in the list `b`. All other variables (`case`, `t`, `i`, `num2`, `total`, `students`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.**
