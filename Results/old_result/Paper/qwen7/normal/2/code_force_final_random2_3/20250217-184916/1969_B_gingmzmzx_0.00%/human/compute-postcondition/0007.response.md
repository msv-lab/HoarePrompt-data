Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt` is [1, 0], `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the element `c` in the list `cnt`. Since the initial value of `cnt` is `[0, 0]`, after executing this line, the count of the element `c` (which is the first element in `cnt`) will be incremented by 1, making it `[1, 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
