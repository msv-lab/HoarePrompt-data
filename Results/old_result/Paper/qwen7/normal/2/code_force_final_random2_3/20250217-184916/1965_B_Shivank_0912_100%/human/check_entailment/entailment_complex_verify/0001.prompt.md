You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        i = 0
        
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        
        print(len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The list `ans` will contain all integers from 1 to 1048575 * 2^19, and `j` will be 20.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a list of integers based on the value of \( k \) and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. The list contains specific values derived from \( k \) and powers of 2, ensuring it includes all integers from 1 to 1048575 * 2^19.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - A loop runs until `1 << (i + 1) > k`. This ensures that `i` is set to the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\).

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed with three specific values:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This value ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This value is included to ensure subsequences can sum to `k + 1`.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This value is included to ensure subsequences can sum to `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.

4. **Additional Values**:
   - The program appends powers of 2 (from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`) to the sequence `ans`, excluding the power of 2 corresponding to `i`.

5. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is printed.
   - The sequence `ans` is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Constraints and Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
   - The value `k - (1 << i)` is included in the sequence. Any subsequence that includes this value will not sum to `k` because the remaining part of the subsequence would have to sum to a negative number, which is impossible.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
   - The sequence includes all powers of 2 from `1` to `1 << 19` (excluding one). These values allow constructing any sum from 1 to `n` except `k` by combining them appropriately.

3. **Sequence Length**:
   - The sequence length is at most 25, which satisfies the problem constraint.

### Conclusion:

The program constructs a sequence that meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
