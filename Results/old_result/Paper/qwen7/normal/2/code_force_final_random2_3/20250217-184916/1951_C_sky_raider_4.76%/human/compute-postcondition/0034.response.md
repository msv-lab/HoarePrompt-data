Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is `c + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is updated by adding the value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. Here, `i` is 1, so `l[i]` is `l[1]`. The other variables (`n` and `k`) are not affected by this operation, so they retain their initial conditions.
