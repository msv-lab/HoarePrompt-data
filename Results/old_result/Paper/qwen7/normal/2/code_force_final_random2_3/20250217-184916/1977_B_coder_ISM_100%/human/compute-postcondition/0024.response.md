Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 29, `s` is a list of length 59 (since 30 + 29 = 59) where each element is either '1' or '0' based on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is true or false for each iteration from 0 to 29. The list `s` will contain the binary representation of the integer `x` with leading zeros up to a length of 30, followed by the binary representation of `x` with leading zeros up to a length of 29.
