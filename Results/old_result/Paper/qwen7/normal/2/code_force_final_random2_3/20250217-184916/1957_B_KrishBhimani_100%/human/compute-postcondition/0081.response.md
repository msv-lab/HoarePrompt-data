Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `k` to `k0`, which means `k0` now holds the same value as `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
