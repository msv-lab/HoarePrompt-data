Output State: **`tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `maxsize = max(a)` calculates the maximum value in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `maxsize`. The other variables (`tc`, `t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
