Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `n` is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ n[0] ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ n[1] < 2^30; `x` is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ x[0] ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x[1] < 2^30; `a` is a list of n[0] integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n[0]; `a` is now the result of `func_1()`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(29, -1, -1):
    u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
    if u == v == 0:
        continue
    if u == 0:
        if v % 2:
            return ans
        else:
            op = ai = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                ai ^= val
                if not op:
                    t.append(ai)
                    ai = 0
            a, t = t, []
    elif v % 2:
        continue
    elif v:
        op = cnt = 0
        for val in a:
            op ^= val >> i & 1
            if not op:
                cnt += 1
        ans = max(ans, cnt)
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 29, `u` is 0, and `v` is even. If `u` and `v` are both 0, we continue with the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is odd, then `v` is set to 0. If `v` is even, either `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `cnt`, or there is no change to `ans` and `cnt` due to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `a` is a list of integers with all its elements processed, `ai` is 0, `t` is an empty list, and `op` is the final result of the XOR operation over all elements in `a` shifted right by `i` bits and masked with 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 28, `u` is either 0 or 1, `v` is either even or the sum of [(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a] modulo 2 is not 0. If `u` is 0, `v` remains unchanged. If `u` is 1, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation over the 28th bit of each element in `a`, `cnt` is the total number of times `op` became `False` during the loop execution, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 27, `u` is 0, and `v` is even. If `v` is odd, the loop continues as is. If `v` is 0, then `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`, `val` is undefined, and `op` is the final result of XORing the i-th bit of each element in `a` with itself, and `cnt` is the total number of times `op` became `False` during the loop executions. If `v` is not 0, the loop breaks.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
