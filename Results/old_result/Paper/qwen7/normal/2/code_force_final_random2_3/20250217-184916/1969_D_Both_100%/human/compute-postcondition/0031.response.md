Postcondition: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `combined` will be empty, `heap` will contain the `k` smallest elements from the original `combined` list (assuming `combined` had enough elements), `k` will be 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, and all other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.**
