Output State: **day is 'AM'**

The code simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. Since the initial state of `day` was not specified to be anything other than `'AM'`, and no operations were performed on `day`, the value of `day` remains `'AM'`. All other variables remain in their initial state, but since no other variables were mentioned in the initial state, they are not included in the output state.
