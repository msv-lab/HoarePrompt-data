Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration, with `bx` being less than `ax`.**
