Postcondition: `k` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, and the list `ans2` either remains unchanged or contains the element `c[i]` appended to it, depending on whether `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`. If `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to -2 and `ans2` is updated to include `c[i]`. If `c[i]` does not equal `c[i - 1]`, then `k` remains 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, and `ans2` remains unchanged.
