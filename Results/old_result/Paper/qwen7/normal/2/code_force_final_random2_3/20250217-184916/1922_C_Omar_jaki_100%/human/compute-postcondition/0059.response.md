Output State: `u` is 0, `t` is `t - 2 * n - 1`, `a` is a tuple with at least 5 elements where the first four elements are `(-1000000000.0, c, d, 2000000000.0)`, and the rest are determined by the loop, `b` is a list where the last two elements are modified according to the conditions given in the loop body for each iteration, `v` is the difference between the current element and the previous element in `a` during the last iteration.

In more detail:
- The variable `u` remains unchanged at 0.
- The variable `t` decreases by `2 * n + 1` for each iteration of the loop.
- The tuple `a` starts with `(-1000000000.0, c, d, 2000000000.0)` and can have additional elements added based on the loop's execution.
- The list `b` is updated in each iteration based on the conditions provided in the loop body. Specifically, for each iteration, the last two elements of `b` are updated as follows:
  - `b[-2]` is updated by adding `v ** (v > x - w)` where `v = y - x`.
  - `b[-1]` is updated by adding `v ** (v > z - y)` where `v = y - x`.
- The variable `v` is the difference between the current element and the previous element in `a` during the last iteration of the loop.
