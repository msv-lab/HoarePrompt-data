Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is an empty list, `r` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == 'L':
        b.append(a[l])
        l += 1
    else:
        b.append(a[r])
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s`, and `b` is a list. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[l]` where `l` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[r-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s`, `b` is a list. If the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[l+1]` and `l` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is not 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[r-1]` and `r` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same as before, `b` has a new element added. If `s[i]` equals 'L', then `b` gets a new element which is `a[l]` and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `b` gets a new element appended which is the value of `a[r]` and `r` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
