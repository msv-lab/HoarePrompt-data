Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `hmp` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next key in `hmp`.
   - If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in hmp:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The loop iterates over each key in `hmp`.
   - The variable `i` takes the value of the current key in each iteration.
   - The loop condition is based on the presence of keys in `hmp`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is the key being iterated over, it will change in each iteration.
   - `hmp` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `ans` is updated based on the value of `hmp[i]` and `m`, but this does not affect the loop continuation condition.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `hmp` must still contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next key in `hmp`.

6. **Updated State:**
   - `hmp` must contain at least one element (same as before).
   - `i` will be the next key in `hmp`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`hmp` must contain at least one element, and `i` will be the next key in `hmp`**.
