Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[26, 26]` sorted, `lex` is reduced by either 2 or 52, `j` is 1**.

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Depending on the initial values of `arr`, the sorted list can be `[1, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`. The values of `i`, `cases`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged.
