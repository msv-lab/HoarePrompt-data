Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element (the list without the first element of the original `arr`), `n` is the second element of the original `arr`, `freq[n]` is the frequency of the second element of the original `arr` in the `freq` dictionary incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency of the second element of the original `arr` in the `freq` dictionary. Initially, `freq[n]` was set to the frequency of `n` in the dictionary, which is incremented by 1. Therefore, `freq[n]` is now one more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
