Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, and two binary strings `a_1` and `a_2`. For each test case, it constructs a new binary string `s` by concatenating parts of `a_1` and `a_2` based on certain conditions. It then calculates a value `t` representing the length of a matching segment between `s` and a substring of `a_2`, and returns this value. If no match is found, `t` is set to -1. The function prints the constructed string `s` and the value `t`.**
