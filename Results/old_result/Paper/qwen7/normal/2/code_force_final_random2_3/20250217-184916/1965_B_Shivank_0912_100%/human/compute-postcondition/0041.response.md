Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `[1048576 - (1 << 20), 1048577, 1048577 + (1 << 20)]`, `i` is 20, `tc` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is 1048576.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `ans` with the values calculated using the current value of `k` and `i`. Since `i` was incremented until it reached 20, the final values are used to update `ans`. The value of `k` is 1048576, which is \(2^{20}\). Thus, the updated `ans` list contains the values `[1048576 - (1 << 20), 1048577, 1048577 + (1 << 20)]`, which simplifies to `[1048576 - 1048576, 1048577, 1048577 + 1048576]`, resulting in `[0, 1048577, 2097153]`. The variables `i`, `tc`, `n`, and `k` retain their respective values from the initial state.
