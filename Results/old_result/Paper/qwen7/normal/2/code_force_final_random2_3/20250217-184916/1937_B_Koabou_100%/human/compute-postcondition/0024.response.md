Output State: **`y` is equal to `i`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first `i + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the `i-th` element of `a[1]`, `x` is `i`, `y` is `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be equal to `i`. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
