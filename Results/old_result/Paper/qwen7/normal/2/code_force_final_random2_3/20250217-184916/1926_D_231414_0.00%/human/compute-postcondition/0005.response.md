Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `dic`. This does not affect the values of `times`, `n`, or `data`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
