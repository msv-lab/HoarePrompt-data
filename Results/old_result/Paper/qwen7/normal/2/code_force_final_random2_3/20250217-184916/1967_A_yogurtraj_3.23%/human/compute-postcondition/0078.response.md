Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than 6, `r` is `a[5] + k // 6`, `rem` is `k % 6`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, which is `6`. So, `rem` is assigned the value of `k % 6`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
