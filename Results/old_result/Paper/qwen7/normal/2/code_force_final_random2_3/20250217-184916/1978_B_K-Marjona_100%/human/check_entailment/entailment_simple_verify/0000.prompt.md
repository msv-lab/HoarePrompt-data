You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: t is 0, and there are no further values of n, a, and b as the loop has completed all its iterations. k retains its last computed value for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for all potential cases. Specifically, the calculation for the profit when \( k \) is chosen is incorrect. The formula used in the program is:

\[ \text{Profit} = b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

However, this formula does not always yield the maximum profit. For instance, consider the case where \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 9 \). According to the problem description, the optimal choice is \( k = 5 \), meaning all buns are sold at the modified price. The correct profit would be:

\[ 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \]

But the program calculates the profit as:

\[ 9 \times 5 - \frac{5 \times 4}{2} + (5 - 5) \times 5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35 \]

This seems correct for this specific case, but let's consider another case to ensure the general correctness. Consider \( n = 10 \), \( a = 10 \), and \( b = 5 \):

- If \( k = 0 \), the profit is \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).
- If \( k = 5 \), the profit is \( 5 \times 5 - \frac{5 \times 4}{2} + (10 - 5) \times 10 = 25 - 10 + 50 = 65 \).

Clearly, the profit when \( k = 0 \) is higher, so the program should choose \( k = 0 \) in this case. However, the program does not always make this optimal choice, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
