The only variable in the loop head is the list `numbers`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a non-empty list of input strings sorted in ascending order. For the loop to be executed one more time, `numbers` must still be non-empty.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `numbers` remains non-empty for the next iteration.

State: **`numCases` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of input strings sorted in ascending order**
