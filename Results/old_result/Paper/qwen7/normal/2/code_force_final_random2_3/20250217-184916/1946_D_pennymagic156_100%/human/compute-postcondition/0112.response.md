Output State: **`a` must not be an empty iterable, `op` is `op` XOR (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1)**.

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1. However, since the initial values of `val`, `i`, and `op` are not specified, we can only describe the operation that occurs. The output state retains the condition that `a` must not be an empty iterable, and updates `op` according to the described operation.
