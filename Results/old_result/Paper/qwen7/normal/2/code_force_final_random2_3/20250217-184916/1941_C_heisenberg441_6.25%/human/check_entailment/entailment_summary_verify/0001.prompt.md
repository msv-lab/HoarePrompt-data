You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It first checks if `s` is equal to 'mapie'. If true, it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from `s` and increments a counter `ans` by 1 for each removal. Then, it removes all occurrences of the substring 'pie' from `s` and increments `ans` by 1 for each removal. Finally, it returns the value of `ans`. If `s` initially does not contain 'pi', the function returns 1. If `s` contains 'pi', the function returns 6 and ensures that `s` no longer contains 'pi'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.
   
3. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If true, it returns 1. This check is unnecessary because we can handle this directly within the loop logic.
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the count of deletions.
   - It uses two while loops to remove occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string `s`:
     - For "map": It finds the first occurrence of "map" and removes it by slicing the string before and after "map", then increments `ans` by 1.
     - For "pie": It finds the first occurrence of "pie" and removes it similarly, then increments `ans` by 1.
   - The function continues these operations until no more "map" or "pie" substrings are found in `s`.

4. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The function correctly handles the removal of multiple instances of "map" and "pie".
   - However, the function does not handle the case where both "map" and "pie" appear simultaneously in the string. In such cases, it would only remove one of them per iteration, potentially leaving the other substring intact.
   - For example, consider the string "mappie". The function would remove "map" first, resulting in "pie", but it should ideally remove "pie" next to make the string beautiful with zero deletions.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation is not sufficient to ensure that the string becomes beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
