Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and then the previous last element plus `i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]`, and `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `totalOne` to `ol` and `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. The values of `i`, `preOne`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, and `el` remain unchanged from their initial states.
