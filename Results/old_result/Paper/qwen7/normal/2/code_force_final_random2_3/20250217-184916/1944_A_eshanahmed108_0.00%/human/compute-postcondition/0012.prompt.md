You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). For each test case, `n` is the integer input received on the line where `n` and `k` are defined, and `k` is the integer input received on the same line as `n`. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final values of `n` and `k` will be the last set of inputs provided within the range of `t` test cases.
    #
    #This means that the final values of `n` and `k` will be those obtained from the last test case processed by the loop, given the constraints on `t`, `n`, and `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. It returns a value based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
