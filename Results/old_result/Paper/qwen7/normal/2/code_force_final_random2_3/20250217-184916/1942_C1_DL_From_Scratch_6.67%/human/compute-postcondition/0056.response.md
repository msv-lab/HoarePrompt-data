Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `i` will be `x - 1`, `num` will be `n - list0[-1]`, and `count` will be the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution. If `num` equals 1, `count` is incremented by 1 and `num` remains 1; otherwise, `num` is updated to `n - list0[-1]` and `count` does not change.**
