Postcondition: `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a + 1`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `x` is added to `suma`; otherwise, the value of `suma` remains unchanged.
