Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates a value based on the input array `arr` and an integer `times`.
   - The formula `arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]` seems to be calculating the difference between the last element and an element at a specific index.
   - However, the logic behind this calculation is unclear without more context. It appears to be part of a larger algorithm but isn't directly relevant to the main function `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` and computes the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - The function uses several lists (`pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`) to store intermediate results.
   - The logic involves iterating through the string `s1` in reverse order and using these lists to compute the time taken for each cell.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The function initializes `pre` with indices where the character is `'>` and calculates `totalOne` (the count of `'>`).
   - It then iterates through the string in reverse order, updating the answers based on whether the current character is `'>` or `'<'`.
   - For each character, it calculates the time taken using the precomputed values in `preOne` and `suffZero`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre` is correctly initialized with indices where the character is `'>'`.
   - `totalOne` is correctly calculated as the count of `'>` in the string.

2. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - The loop iterates through the string in reverse order, which is correct for computing the time taken for each cell.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly updates the answers based on the current character and the precomputed values.

3. **Calculations**:
   - The calculations involving `preOne` and `suffZero` are used to determine the time taken for each cell.
   - The formulas used in the calculations seem to be derived from the problem statement and are logically consistent.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles both cases where the current character is `'>` and `'<'`.
   - The logic for handling these cases is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the function `func_2` correctly implements the logic to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The use of precomputed values (`preOne` and `suffZero`) and the iterative approach ensures that the solution is efficient and correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
