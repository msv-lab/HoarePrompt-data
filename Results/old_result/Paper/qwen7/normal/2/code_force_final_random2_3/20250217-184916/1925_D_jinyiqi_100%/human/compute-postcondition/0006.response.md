Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, `sum_f` is 0, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `f` is the third integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `sum_f`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `m` must be at least 1 is still valid.
