Output State: `i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.) such that `temp * 2 >= k`.

Explanation: The loop continues to double `temp` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`. This means that after the loop completes, `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `i` will be the number of times `temp` was doubled, which could be 0 or 1 depending on the initial value of `k`. All other variables (`l1`, `n`, `k0`, `ans`, and `temp`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
