Output State: The `arr` list is now empty, and for every integer `n` that was originally in `arr`, the value `freq[n]` represents the frequency of that integer in the original list `arr`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `arr` list will be empty because each element has been processed exactly once. The `freq` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the original `arr` list as a key, and the corresponding value will be the count of how many times that integer appeared in the original list.
