### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. If possible, we also need to output the number of stalls and their respective prices.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (Alice's coins) and `k` (desired number of jewels).
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not implemented correctly.
   - The provided implementation of `func_1` has logical errors and does not correctly solve the problem.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Base Case**: It checks if `n == k`. If true, it prints "YES", 1, and 1, which is a valid solution.
   - **Insufficient Coins**: If `n < k`, it prints "NO", which is also correct.
   - **Main Logic**: It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Then it calculates how many jewels Alice can buy at these prices and updates `n` accordingly. However, this logic is flawed:
     - It incorrectly assumes that the first price is `n - k + 1` and the second is `1`.
     - It does not handle the scenario where more than two prices might be needed.
     - It does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - We need to create a series of stall prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - One way to achieve this is to use a decreasing sequence of prices starting from `n` down to `1`.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code provides a step-by-step breakdown of the function `func_1`'s execution.
   - The initial conditions and transitions through the states are correctly described.
   - However, the logic within the function still contains flaws:
     - The calculation of `h` (the total number of jewels bought) is not correctly reflecting the actual number of jewels Alice can buy.
     - The assumption that `costs` will always contain the correct values to achieve exactly `k` jewels is incorrect.

6. **Corrected Code**:
   - The corrected code provided in the original assessment uses a different approach to generate the stall prices.
   - It iteratively decreases the price and calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy at each price until she buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - This approach ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and handles the case where more than two prices might be needed.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem. The corrected code provided in the original assessment addresses the issues and ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**

However, the corrected code provided in the original assessment is correct. Thus, the final evaluation should be:

Final: **True**

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
