Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `n // 2`, `zero` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is now irrelevant since it has been updated). The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `n` is still `n // 2`, and `zero` is now 1.
