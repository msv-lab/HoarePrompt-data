Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`**.

The code `sl = list(s)` converts the string `s` into a list of its characters and assigns it to the variable `sl`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `pk` remain unchanged from their initial states.
