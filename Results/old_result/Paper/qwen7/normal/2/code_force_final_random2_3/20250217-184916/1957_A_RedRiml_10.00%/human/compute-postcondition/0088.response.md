Output State: **All elements in `palka` are appended to `pl`, and `d` contains each unique element from `palka` as a key with its value being the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `palka` will have been fully processed, meaning every element in `palka` will be appended to `pl`. The dictionary `d` will contain each unique element from `palka` as a key, with the corresponding value being the count of how many times that element appeared in `palka`.
