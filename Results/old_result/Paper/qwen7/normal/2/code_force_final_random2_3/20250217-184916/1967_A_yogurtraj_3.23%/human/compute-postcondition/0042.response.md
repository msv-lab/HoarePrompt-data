Let's break down the initial state and the expression to be printed step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `k` is not 0.
   - `r` is calculated as `a[n-1] + k // n`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is -1.

2. **Expression to be Printed:**
   ```python
   print((r - 1) * n + 1)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `r`:**
   - Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[n-1]`. However, we know that `r` is calculated as `a[n-1] + k // n`.
   - Given that `n` is greater than 1 and `k` is not 0, `k // n` will be an integer (the quotient of `k` divided by `n`).

4. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `(r - 1) * n + 1` simplifies to:
     - First, compute `r - 1`.
     - Multiply the result by `n`.
     - Add 1 to the product.

5. **Precise Description:**
   - Since `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`, and without knowing the exact values of `a[n-1]` and `k`, we can only describe `r` in terms of these variables.
   - Therefore, the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` will be:
     - `(a[n-1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1`.

Given the above breakdown, the precise description of the output is:

Output: **(a[n-1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1**
