Output State: The `tree` deque will contain `n` elements, where `n` is the integer provided as input. The `empty` variable will be `False`. The order of elements in `tree` will be determined by the sequence of inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each pair `(u, v)`:

- If `empty` is `True`, the first element `u` will be appended to the left end of `tree`, and then `v` will be appended to the right end of `tree`, making `empty` `False`.
- If `empty` is `False`, the logic checks whether `v` or `u` should be placed at the left or right end of `tree` based on their positions relative to the current first and last elements of `tree`.

The final state of `tree` will be a deque containing all the nodes from the input pairs, arranged according to the rules described above.
