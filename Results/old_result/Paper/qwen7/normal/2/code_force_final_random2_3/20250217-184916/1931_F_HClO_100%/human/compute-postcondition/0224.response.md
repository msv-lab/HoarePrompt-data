Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `idx1` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `n - 2`. All other variables (`n`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged. The condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not directly affected by this line of code, so it remains part of the postcondition but is not updated here.
