Output State: `shapes` is the total count of unique elements from all `palka` lists that appear 3 or more times across all iterations, `palka` is a list of integers from all iterations, `d` is a dictionary containing the final counts of each integer across all iterations, and `pl` is a list of unique elements from all `palka` lists in the order they were first encountered.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `shapes` will hold the total count of unique elements that appeared 3 or more times in any of the `palka` lists. The list `palka` will contain all integers from every `palka` list used in the iterations. The dictionary `d` will have the final counts of each integer across all iterations. The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from all `palka` lists in the order they were first encountered, as no elements are removed from `pl` during the loop's execution.
