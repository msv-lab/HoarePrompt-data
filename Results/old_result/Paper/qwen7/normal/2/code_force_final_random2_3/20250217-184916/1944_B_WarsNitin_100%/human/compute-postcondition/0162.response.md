Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and the current value of `k` is 0, resulting in a break from the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, `b[i]` is added to the list `l`, and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.
