Postcondition: **`y` is `n - 1`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1, and `a` is set to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b` is true, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` where the condition `(a - l[x] <= b - l[x])` is false for the first such `x`, and `a` is assigned the value of `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]` is true for at least one `x` in the range from `y + 1` to `n - 1`. If no such `x` exists, `b` remains as the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`.**
