Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `h` and its range `range(0, n)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `h` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `li` is a list with two elements: `a + k * c + d * h` and `a + k * c + d * h`.
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive.
   - `h` is 1.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `h` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, at the end of each iteration, `h` is incremented by 1.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` needs to be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the range, and no information suggests it has changed.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - The list `li` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
   - `h` changes to 2.
   - `n` remains the same (between 2 and 500 inclusive).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`li` is a list with two elements: `a + k * c + d * h` and `a + k * c + d * h`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 2**
