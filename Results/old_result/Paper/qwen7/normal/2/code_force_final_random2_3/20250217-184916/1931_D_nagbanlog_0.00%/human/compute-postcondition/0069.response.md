Postcondition: `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary. `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`. `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations. `freq`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` retain their original values. The tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in the `freq` dictionary.
