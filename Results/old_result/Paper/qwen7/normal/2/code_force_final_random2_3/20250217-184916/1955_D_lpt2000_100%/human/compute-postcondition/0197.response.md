Output State: **`fnd` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `pairs_in_D` is now greater than or equal to `k`; `m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 1; `D[out_aa]` is either decreased by 1 or remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1 if it was greater than 0, otherwise `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is now `pairs_in_D + 1`; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The line `pairs_in_D += 1` increments the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
