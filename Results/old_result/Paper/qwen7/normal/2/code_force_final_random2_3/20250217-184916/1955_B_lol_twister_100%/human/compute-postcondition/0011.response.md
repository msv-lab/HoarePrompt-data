Output State: `k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 299 (since the loop runs from 0 to n-1), `li` is a list containing the values `a + k * c + d * h` for each `h` in the range of `0` to `n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `k` remains 0, `n` still must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` will be 299 because the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` contains 500 elements, each being the value of the expression `a + k * c + d * h` for every integer `h` from 0 up to 499 (since `n` is 500).
