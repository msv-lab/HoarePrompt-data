You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), and x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q).

    M = []

    #State: Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q); `M` is a list. If `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains `[w]`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.

    #State: Output State: `i` will be `w + 1`, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer, and `M` will contain all integers from 1 up to and including `w`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `w + 1`. During each iteration, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` itself or `q // i` is added to the list `M`. Since the loop processes all divisors of `q` up to `w`, `M` will include all integers from 1 up to and including `w`.
    return M
    #The program returns a list `M` containing all integers from 1 up to and including the square root `w` of `q`, where `q` is a perfect square greater than 1 and `w` is an integer.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - It calculates `y = n + x`.

3. **Checking Parity of `y`:**
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - If `y` is even, it proceeds further.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - It calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and stores the result in `L1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the result of another call to `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`.

5. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - It converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and then calculates the length of the set.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes `q` and `x` as arguments.
   - It initializes an empty list `M`.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It iterates from `1` to `w` and checks if `q` is divisible by `i` and if either `i` or `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It appends valid values to `M` and returns `M`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Parity Check:**
   - The condition `if y % 2 != 0:` correctly identifies when `y` is odd, ensuring that the settling pattern cannot exist in such cases, which is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` aims to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The approach of checking both `i` and `q // i` ensures that all relevant divisors are considered.

3. **Combining Results:**
   - The combination of results from `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` is handled correctly.
   - The use of a set to remove duplicates before calculating the length is appropriate.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `n` is very large and `x` is small, ensuring that the calculations do not overflow or produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality. The program correctly identifies the number of possible values of `k` that satisfy the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
