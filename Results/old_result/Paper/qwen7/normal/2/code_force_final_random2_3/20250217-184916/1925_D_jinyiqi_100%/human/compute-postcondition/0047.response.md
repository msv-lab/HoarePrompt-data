Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(m)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: According to the given state before the loop, `j` is already set to `m - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. Since `j` starts at `m - 1`, the loop will execute exactly once if `m` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means `m` must be at least 1, and `j` should be initialized to `m - 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` and `j`.

**Final State**:
State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
