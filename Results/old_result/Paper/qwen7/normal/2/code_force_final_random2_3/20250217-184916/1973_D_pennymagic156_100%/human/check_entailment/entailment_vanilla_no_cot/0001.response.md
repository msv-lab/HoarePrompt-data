Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the required logic for the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func_3()` reads space-separated integers from the input.
   - The function `func_2()` reads a single integer from the input.
   - The function `func_4()` reads a single line of input.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The function `func_5()` is the main function that processes the input and makes the necessary queries.
   - It starts by reading `n` and `k` using `func_3()`.
   - It initializes `v` to 1 and iterates backward from `n` to 1 to find the smallest `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`.
     - For each `i`, it prints a query `? 1 {i * n}` and reads the response `v`.
     - If `v == n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - After finding `v`, it enters a loop where it tries to split the array into `k` subarrays such that each subarray has the same product `v`.
     - For each subarray, it initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to 1.
     - It prints a query `? {l} {i * v}` and reads the response `l`.
     - If `l == n + 1`, it means no valid `r` exists, and it prints `! -1` and returns.
     - If `l` is found, it decrements `cnt` and increments `l` until `cnt` reaches 0 or `l` exceeds `n`.
   - If all subarrays are successfully found, it prints the final answer `! {i * v}` and returns.

### Verification:

1. **Finding `v`:**
   - The logic to find `v` is correct. It iterates backward to find the smallest `i` such that `f(1, i) = i * n`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The logic to split the array into `k` subarrays with the same product `v` is also correct. It uses a nested loop to find each subarray and ensures that the product condition is met.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no valid subarray can be found by checking if `l` becomes `n + 1` and printing `-1`.

4. **Query Limits:**
   - The program ensures that it does not exceed the query limit by stopping when it finds that no valid subarray can be formed.

### Conclusion:

The given Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, finds the value `v`, and then attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays with the same product `v`. The program handles edge cases appropriately and does not exceed the query limit.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
