Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance of the problemset. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the maximum balance. Specifically, the program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and `i`, but it does not ensure that the difficulties are distributed optimally to maximize the GCD.

For example, consider the input:
```
420 69
```
The correct output should be 6, because the optimal distribution of difficulties would be 7 for each of the 69 sub-problems, making the GCD 7. However, the program does not account for this scenario correctly.

The program should consider all possible ways to distribute the difficulties and choose the one that maximizes the GCD. A more appropriate approach would involve checking all divisors of `x` and ensuring that the number of sub-problems can be evenly divided among them.
