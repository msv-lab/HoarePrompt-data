Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `i` equals `t`, and `a` and `b` are integers from the input for each iteration, with their absolute difference being either even or odd as determined by the if-else block.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will still be greater than 0, and the loop variable `i` will equal the original value of `t`. The variables `a` and `b` will have been updated to the most recent input values from the last iteration of the loop. Regardless of whether the condition `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0` was met in any iteration, the final values of `a` and `b` will reflect the inputs provided in the last iteration of the loop.
