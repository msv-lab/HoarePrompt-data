Output State: **`nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with length 31, and the last element of `s` is '0'**.

Explanation: The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the end of the list `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the last element of `s` is now `'0'`.
