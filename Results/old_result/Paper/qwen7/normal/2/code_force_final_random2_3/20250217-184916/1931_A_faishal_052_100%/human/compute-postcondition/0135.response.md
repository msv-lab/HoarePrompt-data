Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is `lex - 26`, if `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains the elements 1 and 26, if `lex` is between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the elements 26, if `lex` is 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Depending on the original value of `lex`, the contents of `arr` will change accordingly. If `lex` was originally less than 27, now it will be negative or zero, so `arr` will contain the elements 1 and 26. If `lex` was between 27 and 52 (exclusive), now it will be between 1 and 26, so `arr` will contain the element 26. If `lex` was 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged.
