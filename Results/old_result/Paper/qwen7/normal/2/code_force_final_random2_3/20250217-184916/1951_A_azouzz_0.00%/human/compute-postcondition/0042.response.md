Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string from the user.
- `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`.
- `n` is an input integer, and `s` is updated to the input string from the user.
- `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the updated string `s`.

The print statement in question is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. Since no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
