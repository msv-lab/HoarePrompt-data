Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized to the first element of the list `palka`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is set to the first element of `palka` at the start of the loop, we need to ensure that `palka` is not empty. If `palka` were empty, the loop would not execute.

3. **Other variables in the loop head**: There are no other variables directly involved in the loop head itself (i.e., no variables like `j` or `student` as in the previous examples).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Based on the above analysis, we need to ensure that `palka` is not empty. The other variables (`d`, `shapes`, `w`, `ln`, and `pl`) do not affect whether the loop executes and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `palka` must not be empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`palka` must not be empty**
