Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k`.

3. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `ans` contains the value of `sums`.
   - `sums` is updated based on the conditions given.

4. **Analyze the Conditions**:
   - If `i` is equal to 0, then `ans` contains `sums` which is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
   - If `i` is not equal to 0, then `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]`.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated according to the conditions.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.

6. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i <= k`.

7. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is a constant defined outside the loop.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated according to the conditions.**

Since the exact values of `i`, `x`, `n`, `ans`, and `sums` are not provided, we can generalize the answer as follows:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated according to the conditions.**
