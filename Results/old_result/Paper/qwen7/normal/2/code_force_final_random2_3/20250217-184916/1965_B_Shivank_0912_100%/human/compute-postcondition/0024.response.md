Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 1 << 1, 1 << 3]`, `j` is 3**.

Explanation: The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 3, `1 << j` equals `1 << 3`, which is 8. Therefore, the list `ans` now includes this new value. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
