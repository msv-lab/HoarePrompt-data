### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence of `s`. The goal is to minimize the length of `s`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints its result.
   - In `func_1()`, the function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then constructs a string `s` which contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets ('a' to the `k`-th letter).
   - Finally, it returns this string repeated `n` times.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - When `k == 1`, the string `s` will be a single character repeated `n` times. This ensures that the only possible subsequences are the `n` repetitions of this character, which matches the requirement.
     - When `k > 1`, the string `s` will contain all `k` characters in sequence, repeated `n` times. This ensures that all possible combinations of these `k` characters of length `n` appear as subsequences.
   - **General Case**:
     - The constructed string `s` will have a length of `k * n`.
     - By repeating the sequence of the first `k` characters `n` times, we ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters are covered.
     - The length of the resulting string is minimal because no additional characters are added beyond what is necessary to cover all possible subsequences.

4. **Verification**:
   - The example provided in the problem statement confirms that the solution works correctly for various values of `n` and `k`.
   - The output matches the expected subsequences for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the required functionality and meets the problem constraints.

**True**
