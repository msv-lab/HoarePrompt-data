Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value, and `elem` is the last element of `lst`; `final` is sorted, `final` now has one element which is 0, `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially empty (`length is 0`), after appending `0`, `final` now contains the single element `0`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
