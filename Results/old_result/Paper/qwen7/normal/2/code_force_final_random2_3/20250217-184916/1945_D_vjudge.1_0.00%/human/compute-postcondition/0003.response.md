Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `range(numero_testes)`. This means the loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable when the value of the loop counter is not needed) and the variable `numero_testes` itself.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `numero_testes` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `numero_testes` was an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must be decremented by 1 from its current value. Since `numero_testes` was initially greater than or equal to 1, after one iteration, it will still be a positive integer.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `numero_testes` has been decremented by 1.

**State:**
**`numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} - 1 \leq 10^4 - 1\)**

This can be simplified to:
**`numero_testes` is an integer such that \(0 < \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^4 - 1\)**

So, the final state is:
**`numero_testes` is an integer such that \(0 < \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^4 - 1\)**
