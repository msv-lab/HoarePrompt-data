Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `numero_testes`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `numero_testes` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that `numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `numero_testes` is greater than 0. Since the problem specifies that `1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^4`, this condition is already satisfied by the initial state.

5. **Final State**: Given that the loop can execute based on the initial state, no adjustments are necessary beyond ensuring `numero_testes` is within its specified range.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect the necessary conditions for the loop to execute:

**State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^4\)**
