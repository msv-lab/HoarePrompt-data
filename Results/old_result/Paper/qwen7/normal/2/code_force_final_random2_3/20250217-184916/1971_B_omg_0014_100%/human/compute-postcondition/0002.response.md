Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `s` is a string input from the user.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
