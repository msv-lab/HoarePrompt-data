Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `new` is an empty list, `check_all_new` is False, and `new_all` is False.**

Explanation: The overall postcondition combines the scenarios from both the if and else parts. Since the if condition is not specified, we consider the else part as the default case which applies when `check_all` is False. Therefore, after the if-else block executes, `check_all_new` and `new_all` will be False, and `new` remains an empty list.
