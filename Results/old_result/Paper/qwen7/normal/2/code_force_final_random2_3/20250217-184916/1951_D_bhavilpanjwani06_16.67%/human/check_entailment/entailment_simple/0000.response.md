Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem but has several issues that make it incorrect. Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` correctly reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input. However, the logic inside the function is flawed.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `n < k`, the function correctly prints "NO".
   - If `n == k`, the function prints "YES", `1`, and `n`. This scenario is handled correctly.
   - If `n > k`, the function checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. If true, it prints "YES", `2`, and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`. This part of the logic is incorrect because it doesn't ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Instead, it only ensures that the sum of the jewels bought from the first two stalls is `k`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the example given in the problem statement, the code fails to handle cases where `n > k` and `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`. In such cases, the code incorrectly prints "NO" instead of finding a way to distribute the jewels across more than two stalls.

4. **General Solution**:
   - A correct solution would involve setting up a series of stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One approach is to create stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels in a greedy manner.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
