Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(3, m + 1):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp[i + 1]` is calculated as `(dp[k - 1] + (k - 1) * dp[k - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` and less than or equal to `m`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 again, so `i` will become `i + 2`.
   - `m` must still be greater than or equal to `i + 1` and less than or equal to `m`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `dp[i + 1]` is already calculated based on the previous value of `i`.
- `i` will be `i + 2` in the next iteration.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2` and less than or equal to `m`.

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`dp[i + 1]` is calculated as `(dp[k - 1] + (k - 1) * dp[k - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2` and less than or equal to `m`**
