Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n - k` to `n-1` (inclusive). This means `i` starts at `n - k` and increments by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - k`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `n - k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the other states based on the loop condition**:
   - `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]` during each iteration. Since `i` changes, `soma_b` will be updated accordingly.
   - `resultado` is updated to be the minimum between `resultado`, `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`. This value will change based on the new values of `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be `n - k + 1`.
- `soma_b` will be updated to include `lista_B[n - k + 1]`.
- `resultado` will be updated to be the minimum between its current value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n - k + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `n - k + 1`, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[n - k + 1]`, `resultado` is updated to be the minimum between `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n - k + 1]`.**
