State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is 0, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.
2. Determine the initial state of these variables:
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 because the loop starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `k` is an input integer and its value is already known.
3. Ensure the loop condition is met: The loop will execute as long as `i < k`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0.
4. Other variables (`t`, `n`, and `num`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and no other adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.
