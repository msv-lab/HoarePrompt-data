Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The initial value of `i` is not specified directly in the given state. However, the loop starts with `i` being 1 (since `range(1, n)` starts from 1).
   - The initial value of `n` is not specified directly either, but it is used as an upper limit for the range.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` requires `n` to be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`. Therefore, initially, `i` should be set to 1.

4. **List the adjusted states**:
   - The state of `g` is not relevant to the loop execution and remains unchanged.
   - The state of `v1` and `v2` is not relevant to the loop execution and remains unchanged.
   - The state of `prev` is not relevant to the loop execution and remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
