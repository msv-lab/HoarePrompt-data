Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a sequence `nums` that meets the specified conditions. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `nums` with all powers of 2 from \(2\) to \(1048576\) (which is \(2^{20}\)). This ensures that any sum of these powers of 2 can cover a wide range of values.

2. **Finding `idx`**: The variable `idx` is set to the index of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This helps in calculating the necessary adjustments to ensure the conditions are met.

3. **Adjustments**: The program appends three specific numbers to `nums`:
   - \(k - 2^{idx}\) (to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`)
   - \(k + 1\) (to ensure there is a subsequence summing to every number from \(1\) to \(n\) except `k`)
   - \(k + 2^{idx} + 1\) (another adjustment to maintain the conditions)

4. **Final Adjustments**: The number \(2^{idx}\) is removed from `nums` to ensure the sequence size does not exceed 25.

5. **Output**: The program prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

### Verification:
- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**: By removing \(2^{idx}\) and appending \(k - 2^{idx}\), the program ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`.
- **Subsequences Summing to All Other Values**: The remaining powers of 2 and the appended numbers ensure that all values from \(1\) to \(n\) except `k` can be formed as subsequences.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program correctly constructs the sequence `nums` that satisfies the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
