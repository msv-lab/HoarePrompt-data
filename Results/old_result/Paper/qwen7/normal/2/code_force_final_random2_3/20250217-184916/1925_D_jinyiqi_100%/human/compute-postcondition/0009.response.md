Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, `sum_f` is `f`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `f` is the third integer entered, `j` is 1, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `f` is the third integer entered by the user.**

The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f` respectively. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `m` must be at least 1 and `t` must be greater than 0 are still valid.
