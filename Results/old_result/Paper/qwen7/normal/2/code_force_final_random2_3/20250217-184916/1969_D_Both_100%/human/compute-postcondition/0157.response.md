Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `max_profit` remains the highest `current_profit` value encountered during the loop's execution, `current_profit` reflects the net profit calculated based on the operations performed within the loop, `combined` is an empty list, `removed_item` will be True for each iteration where the operation `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` was executed, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, making it `test_cases - 1` if it was initially greater than 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`**.

This means that the values of `n` and `k` are now set to the values returned by the function `func_2()`, while all other variables remain in their initial state except for `test_cases`, which is decremented by 1.
