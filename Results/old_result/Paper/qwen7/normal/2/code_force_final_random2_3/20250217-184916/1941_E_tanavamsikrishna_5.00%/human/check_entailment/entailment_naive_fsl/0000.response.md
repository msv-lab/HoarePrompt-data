Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly handle the logic required to ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. This function simply adds a fixed cost to each cell without considering the constraints of the problem.

To illustrate, consider the following example from the problem statement:

```
4 5 2 5
0 1 1 1 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 1 1 0
0 3 2 1 0
```

The program should calculate the minimum cost for building two bridges on consecutive rows. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly account for the distance constraint between supports. For instance, in the first row, the cost calculation does not ensure that the distance between supports is within the allowed limit.

A correct implementation would involve dynamic programming or a similar approach to ensure that the distance constraint is respected while minimizing the total cost. The current implementation fails to meet these requirements, making the program incorrect.
