Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` which takes input from the user, splits it into multiple integers, and maps them to integers. However, no actual input is taken or variables are assigned values within this snippet, so the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged. The lambda function `r` is created but does not alter the existing variables.
