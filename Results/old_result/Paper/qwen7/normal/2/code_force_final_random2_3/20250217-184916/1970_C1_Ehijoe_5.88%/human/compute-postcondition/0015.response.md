Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `v` is not equal to `tree[0]`; `tree` is now `[tree[0], ..., tree[-2], u]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list `tree`. Since `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` before the append operation, after appending `u`, `v` remains unchanged. The precondition that `v` is not equal to `tree[0]` still holds true. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
