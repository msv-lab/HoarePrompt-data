Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
- `n` is 1.
- `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(k)
```

To determine what will be printed, let's break it down:
1. `n` is explicitly given as 1.
2. `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input string. Since the exact input string is not provided, we cannot know the contents of `l1` precisely, but we know it is a list of strings.
3. `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`. This means that the second element of `l1` must be a string that can be converted to an integer.

Therefore, the print statement will output the integer value of the second element of `l1`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer converted from the second element of l1)**
