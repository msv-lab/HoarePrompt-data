You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9). m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.
def func():
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        print(b, 'B')
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `u` is a falsy value (0), `a` is a list with at least 7 elements, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()` after the loop has finished executing, `b` is a list where the last two elements are the cumulative results of the additions and comparisons performed within the loop for all iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `u` will be a falsity value (0) because the loop condition `u` is no longer true. The list `a` will have at least 7 elements due to the updates made within the loop. The variables `c` and `d` will hold the most recent values returned by the function `r()` after the loop has finished executing. The list `b` will remain unchanged from its final state after the last iteration of the loop, with the last two elements being the cumulative results of the additions and comparisons performed during all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two integers `x` and `y` for each query, and an integer `m` representing the number of queries. It returns the difference between elements at indices `x` and `y` for each query.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
