Postcondition: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb`, `l`, `r` are integers. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, then no changes are made to `l` and `r`. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is set to `yb - x` if `yb - x` is at least 1, otherwise `l` is 1; `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `ya - xa`; `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.**
