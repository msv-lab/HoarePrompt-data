Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `s` is a string input from the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = 'SQUARE'` assigns the string `'SQUARE'` to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `a` depends on the string `s`, which is a user input, and remains the same unless `s` changes.
