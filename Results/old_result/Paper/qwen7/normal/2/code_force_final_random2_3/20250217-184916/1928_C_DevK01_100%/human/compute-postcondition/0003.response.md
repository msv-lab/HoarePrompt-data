Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q); `M` is a list containing `[w]`, `w` is the square root of `q`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `w` is defined as the square root of `q`, and no changes are made to `q`, `x`, or `w` within the given code snippet, the updated state includes `M` now containing the value of `w`.
