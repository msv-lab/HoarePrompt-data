Output State: `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is equal to `len(a)`, `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements from index `i` to the end of the list `a`, and `cts` is a list containing all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` remains as it was initially (`len(a) - 1`), but `j` will be one more than the last index processed, which is `len(a)`. The variable `sm` will hold the sum of all elements from index `i` to the end of the list `a`. The list `cts` will contain all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`, as each iteration appends the current cumulative sum to the list.
