Based on the initial state described:

- `numCases` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `numInteger` is an input integer.
- `numbers` is an empty list.
- `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers taken from the original list until no more pairs could be formed.

Given that `numbers` is an empty list and all elements have been processed in pairs, there are no pairs left to form. Therefore, `suma` would be the sum of the minimum values from these pairs, which means `suma` is 0 since no pairs were formed.

Output: **0**
