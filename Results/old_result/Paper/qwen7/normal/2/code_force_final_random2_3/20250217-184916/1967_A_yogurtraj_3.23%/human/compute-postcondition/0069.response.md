Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is at least 5, `r` is `a[4] + k // 5`, `rem` is `k % 5`**

Explanation: The code calculates `rem` as `k % (i + 1)`, which is equivalent to `k % 5`. The value of `i` is 4, so `i + 1` is 5. The values of `n` and `r` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `rem` is specifically calculated as `k % 5`.
