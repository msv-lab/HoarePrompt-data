Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. This means the loop variable is `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable), and the loop will run `t` times.

2. **Determine the initial state after the previous iteration**:
   - `data` is unchanged.
   - `index` is updated to `index + n + 2`.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `t` is decreased by 1 (`t = t - 1`).
   - `n` is an integer value obtained from `data[index]`.
   - `results` now contains an extra element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs based on the value of `t`, we need to ensure `t` is still greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `index` is updated to `index + n + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is derived from `data[index]` and does not change within the loop.
   - `results` will have another element added to it, but this is not part of the loop head and thus not directly adjusted here.

Given these points, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `t` and `index`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 2`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value obtained from `data[index]`, `results` now contains an extra element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` and `t` must be greater than 0.**

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the relevant adjustments are:

**State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value obtained from `data[index]`**.
