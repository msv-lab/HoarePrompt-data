Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` is not explicitly defined or initialized, it's not clear what its value is, but it doesn't affect the `print` statement.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` remains either even or odd.
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string 'Alice'.

Since the `print` statement is fixed and does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, or any other variables, the output will be:

Output: **Alice**
