Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with length 30, and `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[i]` is either '0' or '1', and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` if `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`. If `flag` is 1, then `s[i]` is '0'. If `flag` is 0, then `s[i]` is either '0' or '1' and is equal to `s[i + 1]` if `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[i]` is '0' if `flag` is 1, and '1' otherwise, and if `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`, then `s[i + 1]` is also '0' if `flag` is 1, and equal to `s[i]` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[2]` is '0', and `s[3]` is '0'. 

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `i` remains 2, `flag` can be either 0 or 1, `s[2]` is set to '0', and `s[3]` is also set to '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
