Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is a non-negative integer, if `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains the elements [1, 26], if `lex` is between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the elements [26], if `lex` is 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Depending on the value of `lex`, the contents of `arr` will change as follows:
- If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` originally contains [1] and now contains [1, 26].
- If `lex` is between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` originally did not contain any elements and now contains [26].
- If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` was already containing some elements and now contains those elements plus [26].
