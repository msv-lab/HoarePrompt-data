Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0; `iterable2` is 2; `x` is the first integer inputted by the user; `a` is the second integer inputted by the user; `big` contains the value of `a`; either `less` is a list containing `a` or `no` is a list containing `a`, depending on the value of `x` (whether it is 1 or 2).
