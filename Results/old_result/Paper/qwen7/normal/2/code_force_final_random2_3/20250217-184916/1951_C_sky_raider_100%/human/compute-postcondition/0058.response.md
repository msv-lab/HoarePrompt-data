Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is 0, `k` is decreased by `n * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t)`**

Explanation: 
- The variable `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Since `t` is 0, the expression simplifies to `c += s * l[i]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. `i` is still less than `n`, `n` is still an input integer, `m` is still an input integer, `k` is still an input integer, `s` is still the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is still 0, and `l` is still a sorted list of integers obtained from user input.
