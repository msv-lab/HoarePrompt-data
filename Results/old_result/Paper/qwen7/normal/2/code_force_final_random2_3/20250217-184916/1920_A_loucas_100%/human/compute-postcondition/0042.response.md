Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0; `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1`; `big` will contain all the integers `a` for which `x` was 1 during the iterations; `less` will contain all the integers `a` for which `x` was 2 during the iterations; `no` will contain all the integers `a` for which `x` was neither 1 nor 2 during the iterations.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `big`, `less`, and `no` will each contain a list of all the integers `a` that were input when `x` had the corresponding value (1, 2, or neither 1 nor 2) across all iterations of the loop.
