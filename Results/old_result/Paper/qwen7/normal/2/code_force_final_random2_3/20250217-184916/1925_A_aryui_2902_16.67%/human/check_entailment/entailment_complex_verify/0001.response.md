### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to generate a string \( s \) such that all possible strings of length \( n \) that can be formed using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets appear as a subsequence in \( s \).
   - The goal is to minimize the length of \( s \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1()` takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \) as input.
   - It constructs a string \( s \) containing the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets and repeats this substring \( n \) times.

3. **Checking the Solution**:
   - The constructed string \( s \) will indeed contain all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets.
   - However, this approach does not necessarily produce the shortest possible string \( s \). For example, for \( n=2 \) and \( k=2 \), the string "abab" would be a valid and shorter solution compared to "aabb".
   - The current implementation does not consider the optimal way to construct the shortest string \( s \) that contains all required subsequences.

4. **Optimal Solution**:
   - An optimal approach involves constructing a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of length \( n \) appears exactly once.
   - For non-cyclic sequences, we can use a greedy algorithm to build the shortest string that contains all required subsequences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure the shortest possible string \( s \) is generated.

However, upon closer inspection, the provided code actually does generate a valid string \( s \) that contains all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets. The length of the string generated is \( n \times k \), which is the minimum length required because each character in the string must appear at least \( n \) times to ensure all subsequences of length \( n \) are covered.

Given the constraints \( 1 \leq n \leq 26 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq 26 \), the string generated by repeating the first \( k \) characters \( n \) times is indeed the shortest possible string that contains all required subsequences. Therefore, the original assessment was overly critical and did not fully consider the constraints and the nature of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided code is correct under the given constraints and problem description.
