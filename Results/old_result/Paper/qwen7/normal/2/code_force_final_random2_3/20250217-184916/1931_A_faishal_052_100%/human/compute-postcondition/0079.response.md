Output State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing 1 and 1. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains 1. If `lex` is between 2 and 26 (excluding 27 and including 26), `arr` contains 1 and 26. If `lex` is 27 or greater, `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` contains 1 and 26. `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `1` to the list `arr`. Therefore, `arr` now contains both the original value (either 1, 26, or 26 depending on the value of `lex`) and the new value `1`. The value of `lex` and the condition it satisfies remain unchanged. The value of `j` is incremented by 1.
