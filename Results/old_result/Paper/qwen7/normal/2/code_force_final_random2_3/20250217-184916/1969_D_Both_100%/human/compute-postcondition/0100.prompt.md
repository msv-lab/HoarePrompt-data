Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `combined` is sorted based on the second element of each tuple; `heap` is an empty list; `max_profit` is 0; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `prices` is a list generated by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the return value of `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `current_profit` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` must be greater than 0, and either the condition (combined) is true and `heap` contains the value of `combined.pop()`, or the condition (combined) is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` must be greater than 1, and the `heap` now contains one additional element which is the popped element from `combined`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` must be greater than 0, and the `heap` now contains either the minimum element from `combined` and the previously existing elements (if `combined` is not empty), or it still contains the previously existing elements (if `combined` is empty).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
