Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The values of `n` and `m` and the string `a` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEF'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All elements in `hmp` have been iterated over, and `ans` is equal to the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements in 'ABCDEF' have been iterated over, `hmp` is a collection containing 'ABCDEF', the first element of `hmp` is 'A', `m` is 'F', and `ans` is 20.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final value of `ans` is 'FFFFFF' and `i` is 'F'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
