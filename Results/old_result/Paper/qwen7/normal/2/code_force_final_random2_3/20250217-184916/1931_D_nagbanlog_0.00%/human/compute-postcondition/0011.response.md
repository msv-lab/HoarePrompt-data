Output State: **`a` is not empty, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`**

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `mod_x`, or `mod_y`. The value of `required_mod_x` remains unchanged as it was not involved in any operation.
