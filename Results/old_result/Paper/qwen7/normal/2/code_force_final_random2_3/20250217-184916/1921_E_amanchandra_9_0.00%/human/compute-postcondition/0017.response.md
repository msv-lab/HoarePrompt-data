Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers with their new values from the input, `l`, `r` are integers with their previous values.**

Explanation: The code `h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())` takes six integers as input and assigns them to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 as mentioned in the initial state, and the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
