Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer representing the balance of the parentheses sequence. The balance is calculated as the difference between the number of opening parentheses '(' and the number of closing parentheses ')'.**

Given that the input string `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")", the function should compute the balance of the parentheses sequence. This balance is defined as the difference between the count of opening parentheses and the count of closing parentheses. If the balance is zero, the parentheses sequence is perfectly balanced.
