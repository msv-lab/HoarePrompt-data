Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. According to the problem description, the game is won by the player who forces the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. However, the program incorrectly determines the winner based on the absolute difference between `a` and `b` being even or odd.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `Bob`

According to the game rules, if both Alice and Bob start with 1 coin each, Alice will lose because she cannot make a valid move after removing a coin from her wallet. However, the program outputs "Alice" instead of "Bob".

Hereâ€™s a counterexample:
- Alice starts with 1 coin, and Bob also starts with 1 coin.
- Alice removes a coin, leaving her with 0 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
- Bob now has no choice but to remove a coin from his wallet, leaving him with 0 coins.
- Since Bob cannot make a valid move, he loses, and Alice wins.

The program fails to handle this scenario correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
