Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the input integer and the second element is the new input integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends a new input integer to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains one element which is the input integer. After appending, `a` now contains two elements: the original input integer and the new input integer. The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
