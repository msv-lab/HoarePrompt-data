Output State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, and `final` is a list of sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. The values of `mini` and the condition for elements in `final` remain unchanged. Therefore, `mini` is still the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the original `lst`, and `final` contains all elements from `lst` that satisfy the condition of having an absolute difference of `mini` with `pk`, but now these elements are sorted.
