Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and `len(pans)` must be `n`.**

Explanation: The line `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, this line does not modify any variables or change the state of the program in any way. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
