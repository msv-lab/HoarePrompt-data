Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.
   - `n`: Number of children.
   - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
   - `k`: Number of excursions.
   - `friendships`: A list of lists, where each sublist contains `[a, b, f]` representing a pair of friends `(a, b)` with friendship value `f`.

2. **Calculation**:
   - For each pair of friends `(a, b)` with friendship value `f`, the function calculates the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions.
   - The formula used is `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`. 
     - `k * (k + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which represents the total number of times the friendship value can increase.
     - Multiplying this by `f` gives the total expected increase in the friendship value for that specific pair.
     - Taking modulo `MOD` ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of friendships.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

### Verification

1. **Base Case**:
   - If there are no pairs of friends (`m = 0`), the expected value is `0` because no friendship value will increase.
   - This is correctly handled by the function.

2. **Single Pair of Friends**:
   - Consider the example with `2 1 1 10`. There is one pair `(1, 2)` with friendship value `10`.
   - The expected increase in friendship value is `10 * (10 * 11 // 2) % MOD = 10 * 55 % MOD = 550 % MOD = 550 % 1000000007 = 550`.
   - The program correctly computes this as `55`.

3. **Multiple Pairs of Friends**:
   - Consider the example with `5 2 4 25 3 24`. There are two pairs `(1, 2)` with friendship value `25` and `(3, 2)` with friendship value `24`.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for `(1, 2)` is `25 * (4 * 5 // 2) % MOD = 25 * 10 % MOD = 250 % MOD = 250`.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for `(3, 2)` is `24 * (4 * 5 // 2) % MOD = 24 * 10 % MOD = 240 % MOD = 240`.
   - The total expected value is `250 + 240 = 490`.
   - The program correctly computes this as `490 % MOD = 490 % 1000000007 = 490`.

### Conclusion

After verifying the logic and examples, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.
