Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated according to the condition `i + x - 1 < n`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`, and `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` with `ans.append(sums)` having been executed.
