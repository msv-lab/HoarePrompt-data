Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `b` is greater than or equal to `min(n, m) + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)` inclusive, and `n` and `m` must be such that `min(n, m) >= 2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains greater than 0, `b` will be one more than the maximum value it reached during the loop (which is `min(n, m)`), `ans` will be the cumulative sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` starting from 2 up to `min(n, m)`, and `n` and `m` must ensure that their minimum value is at least 2.
