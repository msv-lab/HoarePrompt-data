Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` must be a positive integer, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an input integer greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` <= 0 else `math.ceil(x / 15)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `bxsfory1` based on the value of `x`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` is set to 0. Otherwise, `bxsfory1` is set to the ceiling of `x` divided by 15. The other variables (`t`, `ap`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
