Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is not used in the print statement, we can ignore it.
   - `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers from the input. We don't know their exact values, but they are used to calculate `l` and `r`.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
   ```

To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the conditions inside the print statement:

- The expression `[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1]` evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
- If the condition is `True`, the expression `[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1]` evaluates to `1`, and the print statement will print `['Draw']`.
- If the condition is `False`, the expression `[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1]` evaluates to `0`, and the print statement will print `['Alice']`.

Given the initial state, we need to evaluate the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`:

- `l = max(1, yb - x)`
- `r = min(w, yb + x)`

For the condition to be `True`:
- `abs(max(1, yb - x) - ya) <= x + 1`
- `abs(min(w, yb + x) - ya) <= x + 1`

Without specific values for `yb`, `x`, and `w`, we cannot definitively say whether the condition is true or false. However, since the problem does not provide these values, we must consider the general case.

Given the structure of the problem, we can conclude that the output will depend on the specific values of `yb`, `x`, and `w`. Without these values, we cannot determine if the condition is true or false.

Therefore, the output will be either `['Draw']` or `['Alice']` depending on the condition.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Alice']**
