Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(3)`. This means the loop variable `j` will take values from 0 to 2.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `temp` is 'abcde'
   - `i` is 4
   - `j` is between 0 and 2 inclusive

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` is currently between 0 and 2 inclusive, and the loop will increment `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 5 (since the loop will stop once `j` exceeds 2).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `temp` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` needs to be set to 5 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`temp` is 'abcde', `i` is 4, `j` is 5**
