### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not match the problem description. However, let's break down the provided code and its components to ensure we understand why the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to process a string where '@' represents a valid state and '*' represents an invalid state. It calculates the maximum number of valid states using dynamic programming.
   - The function is not related to the problem of determining the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur. The problem involves periodic occurrences of events, whereas `func_1` deals with a sequence of states.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` on each test case.
   - As mentioned, `func_1` is not relevant to the problem, so even though `func_2` attempts to handle multiple test cases, it still fails to solve the intended problem.

Given that both functions do not implement the logic required to solve the given problem, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect because it does not address the problem of finding the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem.
