Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell, considering the direction and inversion of the grid cells.
- The given code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` calculates a specific value based on a list of integers and an index, but it doesn't seem directly related to solving the problem of pinball movements.
- `func_2` is responsible for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell. It uses a list of indices where the direction is '>', computes prefix sums, and handles suffix zeros. However, the logic inside `func_2` seems flawed:
  - It incorrectly calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the current implementation.
  - The use of `func_1` with the current logic does not accurately reflect the movement and inversion rules of the pinball.
  - The final output is a list of zeros, which indicates that the function is not correctly implementing the required logic.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
