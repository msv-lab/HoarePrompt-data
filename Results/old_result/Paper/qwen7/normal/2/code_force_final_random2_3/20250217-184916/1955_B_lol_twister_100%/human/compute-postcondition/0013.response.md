Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `k` and the range `range(0, n)`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 0
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive
   - `h` is 299
   - `li` is a list containing the values `a + k * c + d * h` for each `h` in the range of `0` to `n-1`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `k` starts from 0 and the loop runs until `n-1`, the next value of `k` will be `1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `k` should be less than `n`. Therefore, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `n` does not change, so it remains between 2 and 500 inclusive.
   - The value of `h` is determined by the loop itself and does not directly depend on `k`. However, since the loop continues, `h` will be recalculated based on the new value of `k`.
   - The list `li` will continue to be updated with the values of the expression `a + k * c + d * h` for each `h` in the range of `0` to `n-1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`k` is 1, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` will be 300 (since the loop runs from 0 to n-1), `li` is a list containing the values `a + k * c + d * h` for each `h` in the range of `0` to `n-1`.**
