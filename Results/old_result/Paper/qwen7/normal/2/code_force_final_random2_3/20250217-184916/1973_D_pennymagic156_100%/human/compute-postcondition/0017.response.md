Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `v` is the return value of `func_2()`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `n` to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`.

4. **Condition for Breaking the Loop:**
   - If `v` equals `n`, the loop breaks.
   - If `v` does not equal `n`, no additional changes are made to `i` or `v`.

5. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `v` does not equal `n` (as per the given condition), `i` will be updated to `n - 2`.
   - `v` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 2`, and `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**.
