Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `b` is the maximum value between `n` and `m` plus 1, `ans` is the sum of the initial value of `ans` plus the series of terms `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 up to the minimum of `n` and `m`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains greater than 0, `b` will be one more than the smaller of `n` and `m`, and `ans` will hold the value of the initial `ans` plus the sum of the terms `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` starting from 2 up to the smaller of `n` and `m`.
