Output State: **`i` is 9, `r` is `a[10]`, `k` is decreased by 10 * (`a[10]` - `a[9]`), `rem` is 0, and `y` is `n - 9`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Given the initial state, `i` is 9, so `i + 1` is 10. The value of `a[i + 1]` is `a[10]`, and `a[i]` is `a[9]`. Thus, `k` is decreased by `10 * (`a[10]` - `a[9]`)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
