Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `password` is a string of length 1 <= n <= 20, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for char in password:
    if char.isdigit():
        digits.append(char)
    else:
        letters.append(char)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `password` is a string of length 1 <= n <= 20, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. If the first character of `password` is a digit, then `digits` is a list containing this digit. If the first character of `password` is a lowercase Latin letter, then `letters` is a list containing this letter.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `password` is a string of length 0 < n <= 19, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `letters` and `digits` are lists containing the first character of `password` if it is a letter or a digit respectively; `char` is the first character of `password`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `password` is the substring of the original `password` starting from the third character if `char` is a digit. Otherwise, `password` is the remaining substring of the original `password` after removing the first character. `char` is the second character of the original `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is updated by appending `char` to it. If `char` is a letter, `letters` contains the second character of the original `password`, and `digits` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
