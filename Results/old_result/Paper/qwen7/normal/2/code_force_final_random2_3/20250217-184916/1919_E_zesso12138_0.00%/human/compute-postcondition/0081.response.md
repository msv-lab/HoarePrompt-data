Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` which ranges from `0` to `2 * n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being set to `2 * n + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `2 * n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j` being `2 * n + 1`, the loop will not execute because `j` is already equal to the upper bound of the range.

5. **Adjust other relevant states**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute. This means setting `j` to a value less than `2 * n + 1` at the start of the loop.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is set to `0` (the starting point of the range) or any value less than `2 * n + 1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, all elements are 0, `i` is 2 * n + 1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where each element `new_dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 * n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`, and `j` is 0**.
