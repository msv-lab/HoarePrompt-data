Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx1` is updated to `i`, while `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `l1[i + p1]`, and `l2[i + p2]` retain their original values.
