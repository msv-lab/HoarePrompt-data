Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `tree` is a deque with `v` as its first element.**

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(v)` appends the value `v` to the left end of the deque `tree`. Since `v` is an input integer, it becomes the first element in the deque. All other variables remain unchanged.
