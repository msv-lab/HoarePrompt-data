Output State: **`tmp` is 0, and the current value of `tmp` is less than 0.**

Explanation: The initial state specifies that `tmp` is the original value of `tmp` plus `x`, and the current value of `tmp` is less than 0. The code snippet sets `tmp` to 0, which overrides the previous value of `tmp`. Since the new value of `tmp` (0) is not less than 0, the condition about `tmp` being less than 0 no longer holds. Therefore, the only updated information is that `tmp` is now 0.
