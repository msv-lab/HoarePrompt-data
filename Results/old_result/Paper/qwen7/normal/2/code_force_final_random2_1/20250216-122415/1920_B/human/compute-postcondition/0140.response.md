Based on the initial state provided:

- After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`.
- `x` is an integer.
- `n` is an integer.
- `ans` will contain the final value of `sums` after all updates.

The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value found in the `ans` list (or whatever data structure `ans` is, but typically it would be a list or similar collection).

Since the exact nature of `ans` (e.g., if it's a list, tuple, or another collection) and its contents are not specified, we assume `ans` is a collection where the `max` function can be applied to find the maximum value.

Given this, the output will be the maximum value present in `ans`.

Output: **the maximum value in ans**
