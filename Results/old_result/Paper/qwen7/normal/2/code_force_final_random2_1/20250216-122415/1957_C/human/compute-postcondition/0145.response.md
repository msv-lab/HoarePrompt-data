Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes an integer t, and for each t, it processes pairs of integers n and k, along with coordinates (r_i, c_i) for moves. It returns different outputs based on the conditions given for n, k, and the coordinates (r_i, c_i).**
