The loop condition is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since `t` is equal to `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been 1 before the decrement. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be set to a value greater than 0.

Given the condition `t > 0` and the fact that `t` was equal to `t - 1`, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
