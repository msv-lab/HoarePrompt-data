Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with elements `k - nums[2]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[2] + 1` appended to it, and `i` is equal to 21; `nums` now does not contain the element `1 << idx` (which is 4).**

Explanation: The code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 2, `1 << idx` equals `1 << 2`, which is 4. The list `nums` originally contained the element 4, along with the elements from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), and the additional elements `k - nums[2]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[2] + 1`. After removing 4, these changes are reflected in the updated state of `nums`.
