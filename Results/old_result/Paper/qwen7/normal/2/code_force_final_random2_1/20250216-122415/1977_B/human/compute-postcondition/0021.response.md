Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` is the value of `int(input())`, `x` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0' with an additional '1' or '0' appended to it, `length` is 30. If `x` has the bit at position `i` (where `i=2`) set to 1, then `s` will have an additional '1' appended to it. Otherwise, `s` will have an additional '0' appended to it.
