The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `c` is 0.
- `casos` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer and it is equal to 3.

The code snippet only contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'##..##'`.

Since the string to be printed is explicitly given and does not depend on the values of `c`, `casos`, or `n`, the output will simply be the string itself.

Output: **'##..##'**
