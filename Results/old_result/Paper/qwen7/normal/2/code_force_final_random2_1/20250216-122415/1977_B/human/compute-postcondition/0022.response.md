Output State: **`i` is 29, `t` is the value of `int(input())`, `x` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is a list of length 30 containing either '1' or '0' based on the bits of `x`, `length` is 30.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all 30 iterations, the variable `i` will have the value 29 since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < 30`. The list `s` will contain 30 elements, each being '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit in the integer `x` is set (1) or not (0). The variables `t` and `x` retain their values from the last input provided when the loop was executing its final iteration, and `length` remains unchanged at 30.
