Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in cnt:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are keys in the dictionary `cnt`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is one of the keys in `cnt`.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be set to the next key in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary and `x` was one of its keys in the previous iteration, `cnt` still contains other keys.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `cnt` remains the same dictionary because it is not being modified within the loop head.
   - `x` will be set to the next key in `cnt`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`ans` is 2, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary, `x` is one of the remaining keys in `cnt`**
