Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `c` equals `r` plus twice the number of times `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`, `c` and `r` are the last integers read from input during the loop.**

Explanation: The code `m = n - num` assigns the value of `n - num` to the variable `m`. The values of `i`, `num`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged from their previous states.
