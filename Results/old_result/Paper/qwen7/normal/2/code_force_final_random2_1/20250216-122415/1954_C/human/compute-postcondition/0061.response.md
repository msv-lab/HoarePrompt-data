Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, which means `i` is the last index of the list `a`.
- The length of the list `a` must be greater than 0, ensuring that the loop has executed at least once.

Given this, when the `print()` function is called, it will print an empty string because no argument is passed to the `print` function.

Output: **""**
