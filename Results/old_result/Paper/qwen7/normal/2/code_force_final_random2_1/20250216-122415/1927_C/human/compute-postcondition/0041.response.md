Postcondition: `total_distinct` is equal to the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, `only_a` is updated to contain all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` contains all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`; `results` now contains 'NO' if the length of `only_b` is greater than `k` divided by 2; `total_distinct`, `unique_a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, and `both` remain unchanged, if `total_distinct` is less than `k`, `results` will be set to 'NO'.
