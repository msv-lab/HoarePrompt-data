Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `index` is 4 + n
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `n` is an integer obtained from `data[3]`
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( |p_i| \leq n \) and sorted in non-decreasing order
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` plus the new result
   - `p` is now a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop is iterating over `range(t)`, if `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again.
   - After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `t`).

4. **Update the state**:
   - `index` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `t` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `p` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `data` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `results` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`index` is 4 + n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( |p_i| \leq n \) and sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` plus the new result, `p` is now a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers**
