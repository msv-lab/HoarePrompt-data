Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, and k, along with m lines of additional data. For each test case, it verifies that t is within the range 1 to 50000, n and m satisfy specific conditions, k is within a certain range, and each line of additional data contains valid integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. The function ensures that all pairs of friends are distinct and that the total sum of n and m, as well as the sum of k, do not exceed specified limits.**

This functionality describes a function that iterates over multiple test cases, each containing specific integers and additional data, ensuring they meet given constraints.
