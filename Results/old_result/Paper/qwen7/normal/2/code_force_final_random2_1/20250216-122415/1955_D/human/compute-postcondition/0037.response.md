Output State: **Postcondition: `aa` must have at least `n` elements, `m` must be less than `n`, and `n - m` must be greater than 0. `D[out_aa]` is now -1, `pairs_in_D` is reduced by 1, `C[out_aa]` is now equal to -2, and `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `E[in_aa] += 1` increments the value of `E[in_aa]` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
