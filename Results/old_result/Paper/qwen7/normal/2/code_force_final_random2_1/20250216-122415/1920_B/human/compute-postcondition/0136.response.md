Postcondition: `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated based on the same conditions. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[2]` and subtracting `2 * a[x]`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update. Otherwise, `sums` is updated by adding `a[2]`, `ans` now contains `[sums]`, and `k` is greater than 2.
