The function accepts two parameters: `primary_items`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and `secondary_heap`, a list of tuples where each tuple also contains two integers. It calculates and returns the total sum, which is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `secondary_heap` plus the sum of `item[0] + item[1]` for all tuples in `primary_items` where `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `primary_items` is empty, only the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `secondary_heap` is returned.
