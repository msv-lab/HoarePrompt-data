Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `r` is an input string from the user
- `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`
- `prev` is 0

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

- `{v1}`: Since `v1` is defined as `n-1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `v1` will be at least 2. The exact value depends on `n`, but it will be `n-1`.
- `{i}`: This is explicitly given as 1.
- `{v1}` again: Same as above, it will be `n-1`.
- `{prev}`: This is explicitly given as 0.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with these values. 

Output: **'? [n-1] 1 [n-1] 0'** (where `[n-1]` represents the value of `n-1`)
