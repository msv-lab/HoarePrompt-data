Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to contain its elements in sorted order.
