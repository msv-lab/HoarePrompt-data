Output State: **`i` is `n`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `k - 2 * min(m, k)`, `c` is `c + min(m, k) * (l[n] + t) + s * (l[i] + t)`, `t` is `t + 2 * min(m, k)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Here, `s` is `min(m, k)`, and `i` is `n`. The value of `k` is updated to `k - 2 * min(m, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
