Output State: `u` is `False`, `c` is the first return value from function `r()`, `d` is the second return value from function `r()`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `u` is truthy. After the loop executes 3 times, `u` is set to `False` in the first iteration of the loop. Since `u` is now `False`, the loop terminates immediately without executing any further iterations. Therefore, the values of `c` and `d` remain unchanged from their values after the third iteration of the loop.
