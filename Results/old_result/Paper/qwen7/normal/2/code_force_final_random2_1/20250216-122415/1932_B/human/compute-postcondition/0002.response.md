Output State: **`t` is now the integer value from the first line of the `data` list, and `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, each line consisting of `n` space-separated integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[0])` takes the first line of the `data` list, which is expected to be a string of space-separated integers, converts it into an integer, and assigns it to `t`. The rest of the `data` list remains unchanged.
