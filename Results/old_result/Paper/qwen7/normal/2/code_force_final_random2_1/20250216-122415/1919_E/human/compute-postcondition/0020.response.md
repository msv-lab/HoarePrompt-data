Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. The variables involved here are `t` and `_`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `index` is 5 + 2n
   - `t` must be greater than 1
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop variable `_` is an underscore, it is typically used as a throwaway variable and does not affect the state directly. Therefore, we focus on adjusting `t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since `range(t)` will stop when `t` reaches 0).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is decreased by 1, so `t` must be greater than 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`index` is 5 + 2n, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result**
