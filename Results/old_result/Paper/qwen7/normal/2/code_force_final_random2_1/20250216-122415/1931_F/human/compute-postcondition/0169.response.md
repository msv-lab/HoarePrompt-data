Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` will hold the history of all pairs (`a3`, `l3`) from each iteration, and the final output will be 'yes' if the condition is met for all iterations, otherwise 'no'. If `m` equals 1, we continue to the next iteration or block of code, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `val` remain unchanged from the precondition.***
