Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is either 0 or 1, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and `k` is not equal to `a[l] * 2 - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply indicates that the program would exit the current loop or conditional block it is in. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
