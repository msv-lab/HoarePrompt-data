Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`, `rem` is `k % 4`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder when `k` is divided by `i + 1`, which is `4`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at `3`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `3` is still valid. The variable `r` is not affected by this line of code, so its value remains as `a[3] + k // 4`. The new variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k % 4`.
