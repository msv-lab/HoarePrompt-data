Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `R` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input and returns it as an integer.
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, and if `r` equals '>', no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` equals '>', and `prev` will be equal to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the input from the user, `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` equals `'>';` otherwise, `prev` remains 1, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
