Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree is represented by a deque `tree`. The deque `tree` contains `v` as its first element if `u` equals `tree[0]`, or `v` is appended to the deque `tree` with `u` not equal to `tree[0]`. Additionally, `u` is not equal to `tree[0]`, and `v` is not equal to `tree[-1]`.
