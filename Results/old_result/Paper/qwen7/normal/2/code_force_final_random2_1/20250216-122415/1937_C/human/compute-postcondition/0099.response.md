Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is mentioned to be greater than 1, but its exact value is not needed for the output of the print statement.
- `r` is an input string, but it does not affect the output directly since the value of `prev` is only set if `r` equals '>'.
- `prev` is set to 1 if `r` equals '>', but since `r` is not specified, we cannot determine if this condition is met. Therefore, `prev` could either be 1 or undefined, but since no other value is given, we assume it remains undefined unless specified otherwise.

Given these conditions, the print statement will output a formatted string with placeholders for `v1` and `prev`. Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, it is likely a placeholder or an undefined variable. `i` is explicitly given as 2, and `prev` is either 1 or undefined.

Output: **? [v1] 2 [v1] 1**
