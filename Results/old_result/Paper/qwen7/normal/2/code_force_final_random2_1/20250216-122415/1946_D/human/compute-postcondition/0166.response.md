Output State: **`ai` is 0, `i` is 2, `op` is `op ^ (val >> 2 & 1)` for each element in `a`, `t` is a list containing all unique values of `ai ^ val` for each iteration where `op` was False, and `val` is the last element in the list `a` after the loop has executed.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ai` will be 0, `i` will remain 2, `op` will be the result of XORing `op` with `(val >> 2 & 1)` for each element in the list `a`, `t` will contain all the unique values of `ai ^ val` where `op` was False during the loop, and `val` will be the last element processed in the list `a`.
