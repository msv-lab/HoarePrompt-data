Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is explicitly given as 2.
- `casos` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided.

The `print` statement does not reference any variables or objects whose values depend on their definitions or conditions. It simply prints the string `'No esta en el rango'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No esta en el rango**
