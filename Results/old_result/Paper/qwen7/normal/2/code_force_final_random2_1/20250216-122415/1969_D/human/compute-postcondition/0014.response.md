Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `combined` has one less element, and `heap` has one more element which is the popped element from `combined`.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops an element from the `combined` list and pushes it into the `heap`. Since `k` is a positive integer and the combined condition is true, these conditions remain unchanged. However, the length of `combined` decreases by one because an element was popped from it, and `heap` increases by one because an element was pushed into it.
