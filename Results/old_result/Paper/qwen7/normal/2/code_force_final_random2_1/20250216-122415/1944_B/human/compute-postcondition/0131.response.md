Output State: **`k` is `-2 * (len(l) - 1)`, `ans1` is a list that includes all elements from `l`, `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the elements from index `n` to the end.**

Explanation: The code `c = a[n:]` assigns to `c` a sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
