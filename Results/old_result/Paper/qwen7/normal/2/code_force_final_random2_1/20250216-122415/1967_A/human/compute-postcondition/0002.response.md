Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split by spaces to an integer.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
