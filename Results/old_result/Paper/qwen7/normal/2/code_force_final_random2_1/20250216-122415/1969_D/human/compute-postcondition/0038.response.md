Output State: **`combined` now contains all but the last element of its original contents, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit` before the pop operation, otherwise `max_profit` remains 0, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` contains all elements that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `current_profit` is the value of `current_profit - item[1]`.**

The code subtracts `item[1]` from `current_profit`. Since the initial value of `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` before the pop operation, the new value of `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
