Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `palka` has at least one element.
- `i` is the first element in `palka`.
- If `i` is in `pl`, the function does nothing.
- If `i` is not in `pl`, then `i` is appended to `pl` and `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each element in `palka` using the variable `i`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Next Element in `palka`:**
   - Since `i` was the first element in `palka` during the previous iteration, the next element in `palka` will be the second element.
   
2. **Check if the Next Element is in `pl`:**
   - We need to check if the next element (let's call it `next_i`) is in `pl`.
   - If `next_i` is in `pl`, the function does nothing.
   - If `next_i` is not in `pl`, then `next_i` is appended to `pl` and `d[next_i]` is incremented by 1.

### Adjusted States
- The variable `i` will now be the second element in `palka`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `next_i` (the second element in `palka`) should be checked against `pl`.

### Final State
- `palka` still has at least one element (now the second element).
- `i` is the second element in `palka`.
- `pl` and `d` will be adjusted based on whether `i` is in `pl`.

### Answer
State: **`palka` has at least one element (second element), `i` is the second element in `palka`, `pl` and `d` will be adjusted based on whether `i` is in `pl`**.

However, since we need to provide a specific state format, we can summarize it as:

State: **`palka` has at least one element (second element), `i` is the second element in `palka`, `pl` and `d` will be adjusted based on whether `i` is in `pl`**.

For clarity in the format requested:

State: **`palka` has at least one element (second element), `i` is the second element in `palka`, `pl` and `d` will be adjusted based on whether `i` is in `pl`**.
