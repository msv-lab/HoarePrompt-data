Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(path)` for all iterations, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus the total number of iterations (which is `t`), `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is `2 * t + 2`, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, and `path` is the string from the `2 * t + 3`rd line of the `data` list.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `results` will contain the output of `func_1(path)` for each iteration. The variable `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations, `index` will point to the position right after the last path value in the `data` list, `n` will still hold the integer from the second line, and `path` will hold the last path value from the `data` list.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a non-empty list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a non-empty list, and `result` holds the current element being processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a non-empty list, and `result` holds the next element from the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
