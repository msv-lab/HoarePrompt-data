Output State: **`p2` is 1, `i` is `k+2`, `idx1` and `idx2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `n` remains greater than 1.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value `1` to `p2`. All other variables (`i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
