Output State: **`i` is `n`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `k - (n-1) * min(m, k) - t`, `c` is `c + sum(min(m, k) * (l[i] + t) for i in range(n))`, `t` is `t + (n-1) * min(m, k)**.

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, inclusive.
- The variable `s` will be the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
- The variable `k` will be reduced by `min(m, k)` for each iteration of the loop, resulting in `k - (n-1) * min(m, k) - t`.
- The variable `c` will accumulate the sum of `min(m, k) * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- The variable `t` will increase by `min(m, k)` for each iteration, resulting in `t + (n-1) * min(m, k)`.
