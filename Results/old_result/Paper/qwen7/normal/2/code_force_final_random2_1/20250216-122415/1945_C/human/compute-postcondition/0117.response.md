Output State: **`zero` is 2, `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2, `i` is 3, `n` remains the same, `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of (2 * 100 / (3 + 1)), `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)), `lst` is [3]**.

Explanation: 
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- The value of `zero` remains 2.
- The value of `one` remains increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2.
- The value of `n` remains the same.
- The value of `zero_perc` is recalculated as the ceiling of (2 * 100 / (3 + 1)), which simplifies to the ceiling of (200 / 4), resulting in 50.
- The value of `one_perc` remains dependent on the value of `o` and the updated `i` and `n`.
- A new element, `i + 1` (which is 4), is appended to `lst`, making `lst` equal to `[3]`.
