Output State: **min_index is the last element in min_indices.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `min_index` will be updated to the last element in the `min_indices` list. This is because, in each iteration where `res` equals `'='`, `min_index` is updated to the current value of `i`. Since the loop continues to iterate over all elements in `min_indices` and updates `min_index` accordingly, by the end of the loop, `min_index` will hold the last element of `min_indices`.
