### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides are satisfied.
   - The satisfaction condition is checked using the formula: at least \(\lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil\) residents on each side should be satisfied.
   - We need to minimize \( \left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right| \).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the binary string `s` representing the preferences.
   - It calculates the required threshold `pk` for the number of houses on each side.
   - It converts the string `s` into a list `sl` and counts the number of '0's (`z`) and '1's (`o`).
   - It initializes counters `zero` and `one` to keep track of the number of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string to calculate the percentage of satisfied residents on each side and checks if they meet the conditions.
   - If both conditions are met, it appends the current index `i + 1` to the list `lst`.
   - It then finds the minimum distance from the center `pk` and selects the smallest index that meets this condition.
   - Finally, it prints the result.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for checking the satisfaction conditions and finding the minimum distance from the center is correct.
   - The handling of the edge cases (like when no valid `i` is found) is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
