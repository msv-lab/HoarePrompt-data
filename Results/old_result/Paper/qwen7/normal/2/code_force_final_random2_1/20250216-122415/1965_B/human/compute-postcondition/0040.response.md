Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 20**

The variable `idx` is assigned the value of `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 21, `idx` becomes 20. The initial state of `i` remains unchanged, and the comparison between `nums[i]` and `k` does not occur because the loop condition is not specified and thus cannot be determined to execute.
