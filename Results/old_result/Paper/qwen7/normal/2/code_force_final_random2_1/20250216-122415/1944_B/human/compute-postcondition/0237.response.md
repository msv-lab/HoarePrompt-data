Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -1, `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of list `l` appended with the element at index 2 of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of list `l` appended with the element at index 2 of list `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `k`, `ans1`, and `ans2`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that it is inside. Since no such loop or if statement is mentioned in the initial state, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or if statement if one existed.
