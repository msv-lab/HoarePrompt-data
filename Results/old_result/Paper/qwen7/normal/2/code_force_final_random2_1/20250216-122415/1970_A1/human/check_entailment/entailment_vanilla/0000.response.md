Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input, which is a balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Tracking Balance and Details:**
   - A variable `balance` is initialized to 0.
   - An empty list `details` is created to store tuples containing the balance, negative index, and character.
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate` to get both the index and the character.
   - For each character:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - Each tuple `(balance, -i, char)` is appended to the `details` list.

3. **Sorting the Details:**
   - The `details` list is sorted. The sorting criteria are:
     - First, by the balance (increasing order).
     - Second, by the negative index (decreasing order), which effectively means increasing original index due to the negative sign.

4. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.
   - The join operation uses a generator expression to extract the third element (character) from each tuple in the sorted `details`.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - The result string is printed.

### Correctness Check:

- **Balancing and Index Tracking:**
  - The program correctly tracks the balance and the original position of each character.
  - The negative index ensures that the original order is preserved when sorting by balance.

- **Sorting Criteria:**
  - The sorting criteria ensure that the prefixes maintain their non-negative balance property during the shuffle process.

- **Result Construction:**
  - The result string is constructed by joining the characters in the correct order based on the sorted details.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles all characters in the input string, ensuring that the final output is a valid balanced shuffle.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
