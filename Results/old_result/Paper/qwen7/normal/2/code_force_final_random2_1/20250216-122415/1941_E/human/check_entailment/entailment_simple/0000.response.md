### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` processes a single row of river depths (`row`) and a maximum distance (`d`) between supports.
   - It increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1.
   - For the rest of the elements, it calculates the minimum value from the previous `d` elements (or 0 if it's the first element) and adds 1 to it.
   - This ensures that the cost of installing supports is minimized while maintaining the required distance constraint.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` processes the entire grid of river depths.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row and stores the results in a list called `costs`.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost of building `k` bridges by considering all possible consecutive groups of `k` rows and summing their respective costs.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost found.

3. **Overall Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it processes the grid of river depths using `func_2` and prints the minimum cost of building `k` bridges.
   - The logic in both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement.
   - The sum of `n * m` for all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), which is within the limits.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
