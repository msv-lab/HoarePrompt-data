Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`a` and `b`) is even or odd. According to the rules of the game:
- If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins.
- If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, Alice wins.

This logic is based on the observation that the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference between the number of coins in their wallets determines the winner. This is because:
- Each player removes one coin from their own wallet on their turn.
- The parity of the difference changes with each move.
- The player who faces a situation where the difference is 0 (i.e., both have the same number of coins) loses, as they cannot make a valid move.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial number of coins in their wallets.

Correctness: **True**
