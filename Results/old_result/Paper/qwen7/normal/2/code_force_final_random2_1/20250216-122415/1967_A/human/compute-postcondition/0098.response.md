Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `a` (which is `a[0]`) to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `r` now holds the value of the first element in the list `a`.
