Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to the length of `pans` + (number of iterations), we need to ensure that this value is less than `n` for the loop to execute.
   - `n` is already given as an input integer greater than 0, so we don't need to change this.

5. **Final state after adjustment**: We need to ensure that the initial value of `i` (which is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations)) is less than `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations), `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is an empty list, and the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) must be less than `n`**.
