Output State: **`pans` now contains `[length of `pans` + number of iterations]`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 1, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, `s` is the new input string, and the current value of `s` is equal to '='.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given that `i` is initially the length of `pans` plus the number of iterations, after appending, `i` will be incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
