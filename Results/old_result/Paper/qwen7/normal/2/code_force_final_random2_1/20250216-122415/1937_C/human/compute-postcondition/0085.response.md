Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `prev` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is a new input string, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Since `v2` is equal to `i`, `v1` is updated to `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
