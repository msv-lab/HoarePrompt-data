Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is the first integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[b]` contains the value `[b, a]` and `adj[a]` now contains the value `[a, b]`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[b, a]`, so after appending `b` to `adj[a]`, `adj[a]` will contain `[a, b]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
