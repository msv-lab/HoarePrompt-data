Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is `m-2 + 3 = m`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22`, and the loop continues indefinitely because the `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop body and starts the next iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one. Since no specific action is taken within the loop body beyond the `continue` statement, none of the variables are modified. The value of `m` remains unchanged as the loop will continue to run indefinitely unless an external condition or break statement is introduced.
