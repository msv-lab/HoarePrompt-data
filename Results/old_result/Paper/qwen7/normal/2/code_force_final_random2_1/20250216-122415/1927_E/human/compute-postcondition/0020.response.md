Output State: `i` is 0, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `3k`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to or greater than the length of the `permutation` list. This means the loop condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` will no longer be satisfied, causing the loop to terminate. At this point, the `permutation` list will have been filled with consecutive integers starting from 2 at positions that are multiples of `k`. The variable `idx_v` will be equal to the length of the `permutation` list because it increments each time `curr_v` is incremented within the loop. Similarly, `curr_v` will be one more than the length of the `permutation` list since it starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `3k` because the loop increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k` in each iteration and runs for 3 iterations.
