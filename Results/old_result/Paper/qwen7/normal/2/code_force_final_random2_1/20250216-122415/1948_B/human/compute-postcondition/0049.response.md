Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is the previous value of `arr[i-1]` converted to an integer and appended to the list `[arr[i]]`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of the previous value of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `m`, `i`, `arr[i]`, `nums`, and `ans`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it was inside.
