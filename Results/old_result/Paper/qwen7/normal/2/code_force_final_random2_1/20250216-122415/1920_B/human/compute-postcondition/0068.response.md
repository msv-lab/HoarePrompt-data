Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `k` is a non-negative integer. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` contains the value of `sums`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` contains `[sums]`.
