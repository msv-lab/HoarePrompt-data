Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 30, `n` is 29, `s[1]` is '0', `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is '0', and the length of the string `s` is greater than 30.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 30 because the loop increments `i` from 1 to the length of the string `s` minus one. The initial conditions set `s[29]` to '1' and did not change it unless `s[29]` became '-1' due to the loop's condition. However, since the loop did not change `s[29]` to '-1' and then back to '0' (as per the given output states), `s[29]` remains '1'. Additionally, when `s[29]` was set to '-1', `s[30]` was set to '0' and the length of the string `s` was increased by 1, making the length greater than 30. All other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states as specified.
