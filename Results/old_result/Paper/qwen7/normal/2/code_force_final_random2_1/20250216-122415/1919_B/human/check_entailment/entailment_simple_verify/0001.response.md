### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not implement the required logic to calculate the minimum penalty. Let's break down the issues and provide a more detailed analysis:

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of `+` characters in the string `expression` and calculates `sub` as `length - count`.
   - It then returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is not related to the actual penalty calculation.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy involves splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is zero whenever possible. This ensures that the penalty for each subarray is zero, leading to the minimum possible penalty.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To achieve the minimum penalty, we need to split the array into subarrays where the sum of each subarray is zero.
   - If the string `expression` has an equal number of `+` and `-` characters, we can split the array into pairs of `+` and `-`, resulting in a penalty of zero for each pair.
   - If the number of `+` and `-` characters is not equal, the remaining characters should form a subarray with a sum of zero, if possible.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The function should iterate through the string and keep track of the cumulative sum.
   - Whenever the cumulative sum becomes zero, it means we have found a subarray with a sum of zero, and we can reset the cumulative sum.
   - The penalty for each subarray with a sum of zero is zero, and the total penalty is the sum of the penalties of these subarrays.

### Corrected Code

Here is a corrected implementation of the function:

```python
def func_1(expression, length):
    count_plus = 0
    count_minus = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count_plus += 1
        else:
            count_minus += 1
    
    # If the number of '+' and '-' characters are equal, the minimum penalty is 0
    if count_plus == count_minus:
        return 0
    
    # If the number of '+' and '-' characters differ by 1, the minimum penalty is 1
    elif abs(count_plus - count_minus) == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Otherwise, the minimum penalty is 2
    else:
        return 2
```

### Final Evaluation

Based on the corrected approach and the analysis, the original program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to calculate the minimum penalty. The corrected function should handle the different cases to ensure the minimum penalty is calculated correctly.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
