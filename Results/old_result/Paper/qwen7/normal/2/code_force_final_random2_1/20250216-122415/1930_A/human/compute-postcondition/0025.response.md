Output State: **`suma` is 0, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of strings sorted in ascending order, `a` is the last element processed (if any), `b` is the last element processed (if any)**.

The code initializes `suma` to 0, which is the only change made. All other variables retain their initial states.
