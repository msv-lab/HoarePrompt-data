Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is equal to the total number of iterations executed.
   - `i` will be equal to `n`.
   - `a` and `b` will be either 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' based on the conditions given.
   - `j` will be equal to `n - 1` since it is incremented inside the loop.
   - `s` holds the last input string processed by the loop.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `t`, so `t` must be greater than `n + 1`.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `n` remains the same (since it is not modified in the loop).
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged unless the current iteration changes them.
   - `j` is now `n` (since it was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration and is incremented before the next iteration).
   - `s` remains the same (since it holds the last input string processed).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is equal to the total number of iterations executed, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` and `b` will be either 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' based on the conditions given, `j` is `n`, and `s` holds the last input string processed by the loop.**
