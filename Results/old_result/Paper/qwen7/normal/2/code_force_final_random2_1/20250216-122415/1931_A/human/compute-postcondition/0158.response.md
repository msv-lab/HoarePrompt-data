Output State: **`i` is 0; `cases` must be greater than 0; `temp` is an empty string**.

The code initializes `temp` as an empty string, but does not affect the values of `i` or the condition on `cases`. Therefore, `i` remains 0, `cases` must still be greater than 0, and `temp` is now an empty string.
