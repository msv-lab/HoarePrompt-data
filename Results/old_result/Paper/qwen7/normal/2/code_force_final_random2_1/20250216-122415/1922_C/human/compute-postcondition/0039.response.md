Output State: **`u` is `u - 1`; `c` is a return value from `r()`, `d` is a return value from `r()`**

Explanation: The variable `u` was initially set to `u - 1`. The code then assigns the return values of the function `r()` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the exact nature of the function `r()` is not specified, we can only say that `c` and `d` are the return values of `r()`. The value of `u` remains `u - 1` as no operation was performed on it after its initial assignment.
