Output State: `op` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 6, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`, `median` is `b[ma] + 3`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `op` will be 3 since the loop condition `new_median <= median` is no longer satisfied. The list `b` will have each of its elements increased by 3 for each iteration, so after 3 iterations, each element in `b` will have been incremented by 6. The value of `ma` remains the same as it is determined by `num2`, which is not modified within the loop. The `new_median` will be `b[ma] + 3` because `new_median` is updated by adding 1 to `b[ma]` in each iteration, and `median` will also be `b[ma] + 3` as it is updated to reflect the new `new_median`.
