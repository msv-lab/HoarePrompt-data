Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `shapes` is 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `d[j]` is an integer. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `d[j]` is an integer, `shapes` is either the same as the previous value or increased by 1 if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is the next index in `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `d[j+1]` is an integer, `shapes` is incremented by 1 if `d[j+1]` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is the next index in `pl` (which is `j + 1`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
