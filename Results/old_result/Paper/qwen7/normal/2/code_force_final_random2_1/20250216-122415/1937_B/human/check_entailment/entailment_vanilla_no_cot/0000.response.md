Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Path Calculation:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly find the lexicographically smallest path. Specifically, it checks if the first row has a '1' and the corresponding column in the second row has a '0'. This approach is flawed because it doesn't ensure the lexicographically smallest path is chosen.
   - For example, consider the following input:
     ```
     2
     100
     010
     ```
     The program incorrectly outputs `100`, but the correct output should be `000`.

2. **Path Counting Logic:**
   - The counting logic is also incorrect. It assumes that once a path is found, it counts the number of ways to reach the end from the start, which is not necessarily the correct way to count paths yielding the lexicographically smallest string.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Construct the lexicographically smallest path by always preferring to go down when possible and only going right when necessary.
2. Count the number of such paths.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = [input() for _ in range(2)]
    
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[defaultdict(int) for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(3)]
    dp[0][0][''] = 1
    
    # Fill DP table
    for i in range(2):
        for j in range(n):
            for k, v in dp[i][j].items():
                if a[i][j] == '0':
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1][k + a[i][j]] += v
                if a[i][j] == '1' and a[i ^ 1][j] == '0':
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1][k + a[i][j]] += v
    
    # Find the lexicographically smallest path
    min_path = ''
    for k in sorted(dp[2][n]):
        if dp[2][n][k] > 0:
            min_path = k
            break
    
    # Count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string
    count = dp[2][n][min_path]
    
    print(min_path)
    print(count)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to construct the lexicographically smallest path and counts the number of such paths.
