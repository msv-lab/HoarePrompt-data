Postcondition: **`v` is `y - x`, `t` is `t - 4`, `a` must have at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v, b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v), b[-1] + v + (v > z - y) * (b[-1] + v), b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v))], `c` is a new variable, `d` is a new variable, `u` is falsy, and the current value of `c` is less than the current value of `d`.**
