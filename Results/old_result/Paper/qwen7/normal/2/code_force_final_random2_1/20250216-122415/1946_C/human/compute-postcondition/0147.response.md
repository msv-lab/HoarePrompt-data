Functionality: **The function performs a binary search to find the minimum value of `x` such that the number of cuts required to remove all leaves from the tree is less than or equal to `k`. If no such `x` exists, it returns the smallest possible value of `x` that satisfies the condition. The function reads input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, and constructs an adjacency list representation of a tree. It then iteratively narrows down the range of possible values for `x` until it finds the correct value or determines that no valid `x` exists. Finally, it prints the determined value of `x`.**
