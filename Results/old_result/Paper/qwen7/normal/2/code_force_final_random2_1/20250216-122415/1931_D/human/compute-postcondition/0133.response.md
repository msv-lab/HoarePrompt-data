Output State: **`beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` + 1, `mod_y` is now the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `a` must have at least one element, `mod_x` is now the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is updated to its original value plus 1.**

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` simply assigns the current value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. This does not change any other variables or values. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state.
