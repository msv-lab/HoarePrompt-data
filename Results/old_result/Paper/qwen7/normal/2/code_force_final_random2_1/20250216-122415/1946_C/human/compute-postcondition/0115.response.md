Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 100001, the adjacency list `adj` is fully constructed such that for every edge (a, b) provided by the input, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain each other.**

Explanation: The code `R = int(100000.0 + 1)` assigns the value 100001 to the variable `R`. All other variables (`L`, `i`, `n`, and the adjacency list `adj`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
