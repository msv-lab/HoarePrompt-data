The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `row`, which is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of river cells, and `d`, which is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports. After processing, the function increments the last element of the list `row` by 2, increments all other elements by 1, and increments the first `d-2` elements by 1 again. The function then returns the modified list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers and a positive integer `d`. It increments the last element of `row` by 2, increments all other elements by 1, and increments the first `d-2` elements by 1 again. The function returns the modified list.**
