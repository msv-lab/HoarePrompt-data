Output State: **`palka` has at least one element remaining, `d` is a dictionary, and `pl` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `pl`. The initial conditions state that `palka` has at least one element remaining and `d` is a dictionary. These conditions remain unchanged. After executing the code, `pl` will contain the value of `i` added to it.
