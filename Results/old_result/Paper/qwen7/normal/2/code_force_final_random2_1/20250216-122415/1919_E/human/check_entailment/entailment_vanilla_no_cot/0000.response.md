Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming but contains several issues:

1. **Incorrect DP Transition**: The transition logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the process of generating prefix sums from an array of 1s and -1s. The current implementation seems to be simulating some kind of random walk, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

2. **Offset Handling**: The offset handling in `func_1` is not appropriate for the problem. The offset should represent the starting point of the prefix sums, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the offset for the prefix sums.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**: The calculation of `final_sum` as `p[-1] + offset` is incorrect. The final sum should be adjusted based on the actual values in the prefix sum array and the operations performed during the simulation.

4. **Modulo Operation**: While the modulo operation is used in the DP transitions, it is not clear how it aligns with the problem's requirement to count the number of valid initial arrays modulo \(998,244,353\).

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. A correct approach would involve simulating the generation of prefix sums from an array of 1s and -1s and counting the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sums.
