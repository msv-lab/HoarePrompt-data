Output State: **`permutation'` is updated such that the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. The other variables (`permutation'`, `curr_v`) are updated according to the initial state description, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is also updated accordingly.
