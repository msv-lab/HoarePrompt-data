Output State: `combined` is an empty list, `heap` contains all the tuples that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, `max_profit` is still 0, `current_profit` is still 0, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `combined` is now empty because all its elements have been popped and pushed into the heap. The `heap` now contains all the tuples that were originally in `combined`. The values of `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `k`, `remaining_items`, and `neg_prices` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
