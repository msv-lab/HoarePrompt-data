Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `n - k` is a positive integer; `soma_b` is 0; `pref` is updated by adding `soma_b` to its current value and then adding `lista_A[i]` to it.**

Explanation: The code sets `soma_b` to 0, which overrides its previous value. The other variables (`i`, `n - k`, `soma_b`, and `pref`) are updated as follows: `soma_b` is now 0, and `pref` is updated by adding `soma_b` (which is 0) to its current value and then adding `lista_A[i]` to it. Since `soma_b` is 0, the addition to `pref` is simply `lista_A[i]`.
