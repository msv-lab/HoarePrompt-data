Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains one additional element which is the popped element from `combined`.**

Explanation: The code uses `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` to push the last element of `combined` onto the heap `heap`. Since `combined.pop()` removes and returns the last item from `combined`, the heap now contains one more element than before, and this new element is the one just popped from `combined`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not directly involved in the operation.
