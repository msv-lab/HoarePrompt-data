Output State: **`b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements and sorted, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the last `len(a) - n` elements and now sorted, `i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `k` is -4 * (number of consecutive pairs found), `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `l = []` initializes an empty list `l`. This operation affects the variable `l` by setting it to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
