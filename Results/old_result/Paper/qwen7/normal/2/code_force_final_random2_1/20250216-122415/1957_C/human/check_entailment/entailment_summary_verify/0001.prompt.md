You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6

    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), followed by \( k \) pairs of integers representing coordinates \( (r_i, c_i) \). It calculates the number of coordinates where \( c_i \) equals \( r_i \) and adds 2 for all other coordinates. It then computes \( m \) as \( n - \text{num} \), where \( \text{num} \) is the total count calculated earlier. Based on the value of \( m \), it either prints 0, 1, or a specific value derived using dynamic programming, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads `k` moves, where each move consists of a row `r` and a column `c`.

2. **Move Count Calculation**:
   - The variable `num` counts how many moves were mirrored (i.e., `c == r`).
   - For each non-mirrored move, it adds 2 to `num` because both a white and a black rook are placed.
   - This calculation gives the total number of unique positions occupied by rooks.

3. **Remaining Positions**:
   - The remaining positions on the board are calculated as `m = n - num`.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no remaining positions, so the number of configurations is 0.
   - If `m == 1`, there is exactly one position left, so the number of configurations is 1.

5. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - A dynamic programming array `dp` is used to store the number of configurations for `m` remaining positions.
   - The base cases are initialized: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For `m >= 3`, the recurrence relation is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) \times dp[i-2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for placing a rook in one of the `i` positions and considering the configurations for the remaining `i-1` positions.

### Correctness Check
- **Initialization and Base Cases**: The base cases are correctly set up.
- **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation correctly accounts for the placement of rooks and the configurations of the remaining positions.
- **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.
- **Handling Remaining Positions**: The logic for handling the remaining positions is sound and follows the problem constraints.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the problem constraints and logic. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
