Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer, the code prints pairs (i, j) where i ranges from 1 to a and j ranges from 4 to b, and if (j + i) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0, the pair (i, j) is printed.**

Explanation: The given code contains nested loops that iterate over the range defined by `a` and `b`. It checks a condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `i` and `j`, and if the condition is met, it prints the pair `(i, j)`. However, since no assignment or modification of variables outside the print statements is done, the values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The code itself does not modify these variables, only prints certain pairs `(i, j)` based on the given condition.
