Output State: **`k` is equal to `req` - 2, `i` is 3, `n` is defined and greater than 1, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` and now also includes `c[2]`, and the value of `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` (which is `c[3-1]` or `c[2]`) to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 3, `c[i]` is set to the value of `c[i - 1]` which is `c[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
