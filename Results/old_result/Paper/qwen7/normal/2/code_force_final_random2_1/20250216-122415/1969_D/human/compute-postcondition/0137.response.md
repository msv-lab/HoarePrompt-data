Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, `combined` does not contain the last popped item (`item`), `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, and `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` is set to `current_profit` if `current_profit > max_profit`.**

In this output state, the variable `item` has been assigned the value of the last element popped from `combined`. The value of `combined` has been updated to exclude this last popped item. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states, with `k` remaining 0, `heap` containing the new item after pushing and popping, and `max_profit` being updated based on the condition involving `current_profit`, `item[0]`, and `item[1]`.
