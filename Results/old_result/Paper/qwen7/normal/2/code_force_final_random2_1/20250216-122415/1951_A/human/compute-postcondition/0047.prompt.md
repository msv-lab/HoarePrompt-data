Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `cnt1` is greater than 2 and either `cnt1` is odd or `cnt1` equals 1, the condition remains unchanged. If `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 and even, and the string `s` does not contain the substring '11', the condition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the new input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the new string `s`. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is even, then no changes are made to the variables. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is odd or `cnt1` == 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `cnt1` > 2 and '11' is found in the string `s`, no changes are made to the variables. If none of these conditions are met, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer minus 2, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the new input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is even, no changes are made to the variables. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is odd or `cnt1` == 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `'11'` is found in `s`, no changes are made to the variables. If none of the above conditions are met, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
