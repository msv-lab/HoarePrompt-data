Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with elements `k - nums[2]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[2] + 1` appended to it, and `i` is equal to 21, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into two integers.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The other variables (`idx`, `t`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
