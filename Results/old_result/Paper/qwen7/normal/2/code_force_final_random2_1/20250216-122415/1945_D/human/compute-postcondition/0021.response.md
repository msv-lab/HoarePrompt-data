Postcondition: `i` is 1 or 2; `n - k` is a positive integer; `soma_b` is the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i`; `pref` is updated by adding `soma_b` to its current value and then adding `lista_A[i]` to it if `i` is 1 and `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, otherwise `pref` remains unchanged.
