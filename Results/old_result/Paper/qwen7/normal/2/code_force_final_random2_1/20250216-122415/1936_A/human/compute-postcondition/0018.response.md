Output State: **`mak` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, and the stdout has been flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Therefore, the values of `mak`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 still holds.
