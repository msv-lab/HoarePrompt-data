Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` and either `0` or another element depending on the value of `res`.
   - If `res` is '<', `min_indices` is `[0]`.
   - Otherwise, `min_indices` contains `max_index`, the initial value of `res`, and `0`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

4. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` and either `0` or another element depending on the value of `res`.
   - `i` is the current index, which is `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` is the total number of iterations the loop needs to run.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to `n` and the loop will check if `n < n`, which is false, thus stopping the loop.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to `n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

7. **Consider the `min_indices` list**:
   - Since the loop is about to terminate, the state of `min_indices` does not change for the next iteration because the loop body is omitted and the loop condition itself dictates the termination.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` and either `0` or another element depending on the value of `res`, `i` is `n`, `n` remains the same**.
