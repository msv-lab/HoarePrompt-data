Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is the result of `op` xor (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise AND with 1), `cnt` is 0, `a` must not be an empty list**.

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op`. It performs a bitwise right shift on `val` by `i` bits (where `i` is 28), then performs a bitwise AND with 1, and finally XORs the result with `op`. Since `val` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that the operation is performed on `op` using the result of `val >> 28 & 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
