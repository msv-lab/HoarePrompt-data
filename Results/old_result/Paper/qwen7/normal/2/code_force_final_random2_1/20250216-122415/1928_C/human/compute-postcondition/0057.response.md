Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer \( n \) greater than 1 and computes its prime factorization. It returns a generator that yields all the prime factors of \( n \), along with their respective exponents, in the form of a list. After the function concludes, the variable \( n \) is reduced to 1, and the `factors` dictionary contains the complete prime factorization of the original \( n \).**
