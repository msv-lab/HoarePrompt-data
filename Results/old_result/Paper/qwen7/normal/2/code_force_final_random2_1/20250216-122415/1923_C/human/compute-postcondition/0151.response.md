Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is now equal to `p[b - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `s = p[b - 1]` assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to `s`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition for `s` being equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0` is no longer relevant since `s` is now explicitly set to `p[b - 1]`.
