Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and `times`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `times` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop will execute if `times` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `times` is greater than 0. The initial value of `check` (which is 2147483647) does not directly impact the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `times` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`times` must be greater than 0**
