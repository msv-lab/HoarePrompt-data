Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n); `M` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `M`. The values of `q` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
