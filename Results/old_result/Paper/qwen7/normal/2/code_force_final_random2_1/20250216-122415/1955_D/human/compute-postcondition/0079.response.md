Output State: **`D` is a Counter object counting the elements common to both `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of strings containing the split input from the user, `bb` is a list of strings created from the split input.**

Explanation: The code `D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb` creates a new Counter object `D` that counts the elements common to both `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. The values of `cnt_aa`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, and `bb` remain unchanged.
