Postcondition: **`i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `c` equals `r` plus twice the number of times `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is either 0 or `n - num`, `c` and `r` are the last integers read from input during the loop, and after the loop completes, if `m` is 0, the value of `dp[m]` is `(dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2) % 1000000007`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[m]` is `(dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2) % 1000000007` with `m` being the final value reached, which is greater than 7.**
