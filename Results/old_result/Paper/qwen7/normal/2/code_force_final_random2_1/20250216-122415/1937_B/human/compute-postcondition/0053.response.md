Functionality: **The function reads two binary strings of length \(n\) and an integer \(t\). It then constructs a new string \(s\) by concatenating parts of the two binary strings based on specific conditions. Finally, it calculates a value \(t\) based on the matching segments of the original strings and prints both the constructed string \(s\) and the value \(t\). If no matching segment is found, \(t\) is set to 0.**
