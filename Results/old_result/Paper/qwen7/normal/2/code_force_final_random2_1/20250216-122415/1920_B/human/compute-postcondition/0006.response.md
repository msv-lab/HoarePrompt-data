Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. No changes are made to the existing values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `sum1`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
