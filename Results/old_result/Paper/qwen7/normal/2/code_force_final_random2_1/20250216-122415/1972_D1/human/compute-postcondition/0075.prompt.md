Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and it is within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    """for i in range(1,a+1):
        for j in range(4,b+1):
            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:
                print(i,j)"""
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
            suma += x
    print(suma - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer, `suma` is the sum of `x` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is the last value of `x` calculated before the loop ends, if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true, `suma` is updated to include the final `x` value.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = b`, calculating the value of `x` for each `i` and updating the `suma` variable accordingly. After the loop completes, `i` will be `b + 1`, and `suma` will contain the cumulative sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations, `b` will be 0, `i` will be `b + 1`, `x` will be `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` with the condition that `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, and `suma` will be the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the maximum integer such that the loop runs from 1 to `b`, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`, and `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `a` remains as the initial integer value from `info[0]`, `b` is the highest integer that allowed the loop to run through all its iterations, `i` becomes one more than the last value it took during the loop (which is `b + 1`), `x` is the value of `x` computed for the final iteration, and `suma` contains the cumulative sum of all valid `x` values from each iteration where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` was satisfied.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
