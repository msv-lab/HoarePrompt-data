Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Other variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are still positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the postcondition also remains unchanged from the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers updated to the values read from input. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, no changes are made to `t` and `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t` and `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
