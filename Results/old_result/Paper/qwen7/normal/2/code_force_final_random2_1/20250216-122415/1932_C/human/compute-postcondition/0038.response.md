Output State: **`b` is a list of length `n` that must have at least one element, `v` is the last element of the list `b`, `p` is now `p * v * v`, `ans` is a list containing the value `p * v * v`**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` (which is `p * v * v`) to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` becomes a list containing the value `p * v * v`, while `b`, `v`, and `p` retain their previous values.
