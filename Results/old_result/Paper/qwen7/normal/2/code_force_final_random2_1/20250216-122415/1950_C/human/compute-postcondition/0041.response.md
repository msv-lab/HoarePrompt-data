Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the integer part of the input split by `:`, `m` is the integer part of the input split by `:`, the input is split into `h` and `m` which are integers.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string by `:` and assigns the integer parts to `h` and `m`. The values of `t`, `day`, `n`, and the nature of the input being split remain unchanged.
