Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described. Here are the main problems:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Durability Reduction:**
   - The logic for reducing the durability of ships during each attack is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the reduction of durability when a ship is attacked multiple times within a single pass through the loop.
   - For example, if `a[l]` is less than `a[r]`, the program should reduce `k` by `a[l] * 2` but only if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario.

2. **Break Conditions:**
   - The conditions under which the program breaks from the loop are too restrictive. For instance, the program breaks if `k` becomes zero, but it should continue attacking until all ships are sunk or `k` is exhausted.
   - The condition `if k >= a[r]` and `break` inside the loop can lead to incorrect results because it prematurely ends the attack sequence without considering subsequent attacks.

3. **Logic for Handling Equal Durabilities:**
   - The logic for handling equal durabilities (`a[l] == a[r]`) is not correctly implemented. The program should ensure that both ships are attacked appropriately and their durabilities are reduced accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the number of attacks `k` is very large compared to the total durability of all ships. This can lead to incorrect results if the program does not properly manage the remaining attacks after some ships are sunk.

### Suggested Fixes:
To fix these issues, you need to ensure that the durability of ships is correctly reduced with each attack and that the program continues to attack until either all ships are sunk or `k` attacks are exhausted. Additionally, you should handle edge cases more robustly.

Here is a revised version of the function that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r:
        if k == 0:
            break
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1
                break
            break
        if a[l] <= a[r]:
            while k >= a[l] and l <= r:
                k -= a[l]
                a[l] = 0
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
                if l > r:
                    break
            if l <= r:
                k -= a[r]
                a[r] = 0
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            while k >= a[r] and l <= r:
                k -= a[r]
                a[r] = 0
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
                if l > r:
                    break
            if l <= r:
                k -= a[l]
                a[l] = 0
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
    return sunks
```

This revised function ensures that the durability of ships is correctly reduced and handles the attack sequence more accurately.
