Output State: **`results` now contains 'NO', `total_distinct` remains unchanged, `unique_a` is a set containing the elements of `a`, `unique_b` is now a set containing the elements of `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is now a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, and `both` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the set `relevant_b` to include only those elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
