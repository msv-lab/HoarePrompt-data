Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must have at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element, and the value of `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2. Specifically, if `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 2. Additionally, if the else part is executed, `C[out_aa]` is set to 1 and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0.
