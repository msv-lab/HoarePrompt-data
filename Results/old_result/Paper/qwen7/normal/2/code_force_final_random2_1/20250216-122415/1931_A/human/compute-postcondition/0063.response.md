Output State: **`j` is 0 or 1; `lex` is between 2 and 25; `arr` contains the element 26**

Explanation: The code subtracts 26 from `lex`. Given that `lex` was initially between 28 and 51 (inclusive), after subtracting 26, `lex` will now be between 2 and 25 (inclusive). The values of `j` and the contents of `arr` remain unchanged.
