Output State: **`combined` is now a list without its last element, `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list, and `current_profit` is reduced by the last element's second value of the original `combined` list, and the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0.**

This means that the `current_profit` has been decreased by the value of the second element from the last element of the original `combined` list, while the `combined` list no longer contains its last element, and the condition that the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0 remains true.
