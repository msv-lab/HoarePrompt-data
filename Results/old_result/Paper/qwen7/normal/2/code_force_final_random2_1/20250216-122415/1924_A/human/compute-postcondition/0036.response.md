Functionality: The function accepts a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`. It constructs two new strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` is formed by concatenating the original string `s` with itself, while `s2` contains each unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet` (each character repeated once). The function then checks if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`. Finally, it returns a boolean indicating this check, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` and going to the end, and the string `s2`.
