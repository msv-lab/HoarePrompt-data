Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

In this scenario, the function `dfs(1, 1)` is called, and its result is assigned to the variable `leftover`. The values of `numCuts`, `L`, `i`, `n`, `R`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
