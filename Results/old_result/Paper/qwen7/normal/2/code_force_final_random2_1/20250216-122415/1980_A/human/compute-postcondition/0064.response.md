Output State: **`i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 4 * `m` + (`m` - `hmp`['F']), and `hmp` is a dictionary with key 'F' mapped to `m`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. Since `hmp` is initially an empty dictionary, `hmp['F']` is `None`, and the expression `m - hmp['F']` simplifies to just `m`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `4 * m + m`, which is `5 * m`. The values of `i`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged except for the new entry in `hmp`.
