Postcondition: `i` is 3, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), `w` must be greater than 3, `M` is a list containing the values 2 and 3. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `i` remains unchanged and `M` contains the values 2 and 3.
