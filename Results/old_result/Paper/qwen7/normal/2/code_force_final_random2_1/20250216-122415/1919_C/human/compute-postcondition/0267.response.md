Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is 6, `n` must be at least 6, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, and `c` is 0. If `l[6] > a` and `l[6] > b`, then `a` becomes `l[6]` if `a - l[6] <= b - l[6]` is false, otherwise `a` remains `l[6]`. If `l[6] < a` and `l[6] < b`, then `a` becomes `l[6]` if `a - l[6] > b - l[6]` is true, otherwise `a` remains `a`. Otherwise, `a` remains the first element of the list `l`.
