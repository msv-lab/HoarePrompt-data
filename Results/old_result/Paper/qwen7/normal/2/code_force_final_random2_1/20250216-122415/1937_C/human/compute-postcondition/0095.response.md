Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is an input string, and the current value of `r` is equal to '>', `prev` is 1**

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `n` must still be greater than 1, `r` remains an input string with its current value being '>', and `prev` is now 1.
