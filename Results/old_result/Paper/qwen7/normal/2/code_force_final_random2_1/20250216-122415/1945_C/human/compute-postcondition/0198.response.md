Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `zero` is either 2 or 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is either 1 or 2, `one_perc` is 0, and `lst` is a list containing 1; `zero_perc` is 50.**

Explanation: The code updates `zero_perc` to the value of `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Given the initial state, `zero` is either 2 or 1, and `i` is 1. We need to consider both cases:

1. If `zero` is 2:
   \[
   zero\_perc = \text{math.ceil}(2 \times 100 / (1 + 1)) = \text{math.ceil}(200 / 2) = \text{math.ceil}(100) = 100
   \]
2. If `zero` is 1:
   \[
   zero\_perc = \text{math.ceil}(1 \times 100 / (1 + 1)) = \text{math.ceil}(100 / 2) = \text{math.ceil}(50) = 50
   \]

Since `zero` can be either 2 or 1, `zero_perc` can be either 100 or 50. However, since the problem specifies that `zero_perc` is initially 100, and given the calculation, the only feasible value for `zero` in this context is 1, making `zero_perc` equal to 50. All other variables remain unchanged.
