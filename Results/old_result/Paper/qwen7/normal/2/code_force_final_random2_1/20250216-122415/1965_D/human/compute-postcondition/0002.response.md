Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers with the last element removed.**

Explanation: The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. The initial state of `bigList` remains unchanged, and the last element of `smallList` is also removed, making both lists have their respective last elements removed.
