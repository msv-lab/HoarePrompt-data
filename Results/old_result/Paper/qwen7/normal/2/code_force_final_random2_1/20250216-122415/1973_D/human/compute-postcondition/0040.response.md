Output State: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

**Explanation:** After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `cnt` will eventually reach 0 (as it is decremented by 1 in each iteration). The value of `l` will be `func_2() + 1` after the first iteration and will not change further because the loop condition `l < n + 1` will no longer be satisfied once `l` becomes equal to or greater than `n + 1`. Since `n` is 1, `l` will never exceed 2 if `func_2()` returns 0 or 1, but the exact value of `l` depends on the return value of `func_2()`. Given the information provided, we can only conclude that `l` will be `func_2() + 1` after the loop completes.
