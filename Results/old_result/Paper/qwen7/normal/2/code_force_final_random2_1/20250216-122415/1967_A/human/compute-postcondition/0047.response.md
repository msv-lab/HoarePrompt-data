Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `ii` and the input value, which is an integer.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**:
   - `ii` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The input value is an integer provided by the user.

3. **Determine the state after one iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `ii` will be 1.
   - The input value remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `ii` starts from 0 and increments by 1, after the first iteration, `ii` will be 1.
   - The input value remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`ii` is 1, the input value is the same as before**.

Given that the input value is not specified in the problem statement, we can represent it as `input_value`.

Final Answer:
State: **`ii` is 1, the input value is the same as before**.
