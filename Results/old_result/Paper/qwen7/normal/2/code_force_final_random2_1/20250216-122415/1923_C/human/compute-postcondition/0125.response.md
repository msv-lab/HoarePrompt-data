Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `a` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
