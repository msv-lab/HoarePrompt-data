Output State: `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the maximum integer such that the loop runs from 1 to `b`, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`, and `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `a` remains as the initial integer value from `info[0]`, `b` is the highest integer that allowed the loop to run through all its iterations, `i` becomes one more than the last value it took during the loop (which is `b + 1`), `x` is the value of `x` computed for the final iteration, and `suma` contains the cumulative sum of all valid `x` values from each iteration where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` was satisfied.
