Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string from the user, `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`, and `prev` is 1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are modified, the values of `i`, `n`, `v2`, `r`, `v1`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states.
