Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `a[0]`**

Explanation: The code `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding the element `a[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is initially 1, `i - 1` equals 0, so `sums` is updated to `a[0]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
