Output State: **`i` is `x`, `count` is `count + 1`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The values of `i` and `count` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `num` remains as `n - list0[-1]` since `list0` was not modified.
