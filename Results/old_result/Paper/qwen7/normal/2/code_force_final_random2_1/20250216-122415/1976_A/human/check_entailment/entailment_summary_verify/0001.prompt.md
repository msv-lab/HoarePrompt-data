You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a password string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It sorts the digits and letters within the password separately and then checks if the sorted digits are in non-decreasing order and do not exceed any letter in the sorted letters part. If all checks pass, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`testCases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password (`length`) and the password itself (`password`).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is responsible for checking if the password meets the specified conditions.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters` to store the digits and letters from the password, respectively.
   - It iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - Otherwise, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - After collecting the digits and letters, it sorts both lists.
   - It then checks if any digit is greater than the next digit (to ensure digits are in non-decreasing order).
   - It also checks if any digit is greater than any letter (to ensure no digit comes after a letter).
   - Finally, it constructs a sorted password by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` and compares it with the original password. If they match, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Verification:

1. **Condition 1: Password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.**
   - The program correctly separates digits and letters and does not directly check this condition. However, since the problem assumes valid inputs, we can assume this condition is met.

2. **Condition 2: No digit comes after a letter.**
   - The program checks if any digit is greater than the next digit and if any digit is greater than any letter. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

3. **Condition 3: All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.**
   - The program sorts the `digits` list and checks if any digit is out of order.

4. **Condition 4: All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.**
   - The program sorts the `letters` list and implicitly checks if they are in order by comparing them with the original password.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
