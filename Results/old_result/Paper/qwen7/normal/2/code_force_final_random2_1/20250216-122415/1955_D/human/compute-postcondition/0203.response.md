Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2; `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; `in_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[:n - m]`; `E[out_aa]` is reduced by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `pairs_in_D` is reduced by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pairs_in_D += 1` simply increments the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. This operation affects the value of `pairs_in_D` but does not change the conditions under which `fnd` is updated or the values of other variables like `D[out_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, `E[out_aa]`, and `D[in_aa]`. Therefore, the changes are reflected in the updated value of `pairs_in_D`.
