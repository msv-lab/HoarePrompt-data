Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `s` is equal to the value of `p[a - 2] - p[b - 1]`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects whose values need to be described since the print statement does not reference any variables other than the string itself.

Output: **YES**
