Output State: **`permutation'` is updated such that the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`.**

This means that the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been incremented by `k`, while the other variables (`permutation`, `curr_v`) remain as described in the initial state, with the additional change that `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is now `curr_v + 1`.
