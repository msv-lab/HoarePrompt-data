The only variables in the loop head are `j`, so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

Since `i`, `cases`, and `temp` are not part of the loop head, their values remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is 2, `cases` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[0][1] + 96`**
