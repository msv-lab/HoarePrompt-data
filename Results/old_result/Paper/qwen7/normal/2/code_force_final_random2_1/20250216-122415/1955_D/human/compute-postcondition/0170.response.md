Output State: **`pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2, `D[in_aa]` is now `D[in_aa] + 1`, `C[out_aa]` is set to 1, `C[in_aa]` is now greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `pairs_in_D += 1` increments the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. The other conditions and values of `D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, and `C[in_aa]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
