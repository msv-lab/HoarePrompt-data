Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the index variable, and it starts from 0 in the `range(len(a))` construct.
   - `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop will continue as long as `f` is 1 (which is given as 1), the loop will execute at least once.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 0 initially.
   - `len(a)` is determined by the length of the list `a`, which is a known quantity but doesn't need adjustment since it's derived from the initial state.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to 0.
- `len(a)` is derived from the initial state of `a` and doesn't need adjustment.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`i` is 0**
