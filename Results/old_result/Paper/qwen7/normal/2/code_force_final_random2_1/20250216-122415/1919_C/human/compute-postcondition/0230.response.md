Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is `n - 1` where `n` must be at least 5, `a` is either the first element of the list `l` or `l[n - 1]`, `b` is either the element at index 3 in the list `l` or the current value of `l[x]` depending on the condition `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `c` is 0, and `l[x]` is less than `a` and `b` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` is true, otherwise `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `a`.
