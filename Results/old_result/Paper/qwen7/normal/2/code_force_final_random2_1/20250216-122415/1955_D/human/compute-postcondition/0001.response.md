State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `nabors`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will run.
- For the loop to execute, `nabors` must be at least 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
