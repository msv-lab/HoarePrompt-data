The only objects in the loop head are `tc` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `mexsize` is incremented for each element in the list `a` that matches its current value of `mexsize`.
- The final value of `mexsize` is one more than the last element in the list `a` if all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations.
- The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers, and `sz` is the last element of the list `a`.
- Whether `mexsize` is greater than or less than or equal to `maxsize`, the above conditions hold true.

Since the loop is iterating over `range(t)`, the loop will execute again as long as `tc < t`. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is one less than `t`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1, making it equal to `t - 1`.

State: **`mexsize` is incremented for each element in the list `a` that matches its current value of `mexsize`. The final value of `mexsize` is one more than the last element in the list `a` if all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations. The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers, and `sz` is the last element of the list `a`. Whether `mexsize` is greater than or less than or equal to `maxsize`, the above conditions hold true. `tc` is `t - 1`**.
