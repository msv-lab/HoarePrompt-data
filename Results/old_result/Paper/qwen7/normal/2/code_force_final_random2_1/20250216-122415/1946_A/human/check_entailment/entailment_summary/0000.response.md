Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting how many times the median element appears in the sorted array. However, the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: The program calculates the median index correctly as `p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1`. But the median is the element at the `p`-th index in the sorted array, not the count of that element.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The program counts the occurrences of the median element (`a[p]`) in the sorted array using `a.count(a[p])`. This count does not represent the number of operations needed to increase the median. Instead, it should focus on finding the smallest number greater than the current median and calculate the difference between this number and the median.

3. **Minimum Operations**: To increase the median, we need to find the smallest number that is greater than the current median and then determine how many increments are required to make the median equal to this smallest number. If the median is already the smallest number, no operations are needed.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
