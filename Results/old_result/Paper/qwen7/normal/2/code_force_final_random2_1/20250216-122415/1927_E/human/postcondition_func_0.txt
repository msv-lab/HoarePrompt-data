The function processes two integers `n` and `k` as space-separated inputs, checks if `k` is even and within the range `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`. If the conditions are met, it constructs a list `permutation` of length `n` and fills it with consecutive integers starting from 2 at indices that are multiples of `k`. Finally, it prints the contents of the `permutation` list as space-separated integers. If the conditions are not met, the function does not proceed further and no output is generated.
