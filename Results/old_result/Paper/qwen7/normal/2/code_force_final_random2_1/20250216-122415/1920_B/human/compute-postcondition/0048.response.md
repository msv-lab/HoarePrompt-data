Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer before assigning them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. Since no specific values are provided for the input, the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values of the first three integers from the input line. All other variables remain unchanged.
