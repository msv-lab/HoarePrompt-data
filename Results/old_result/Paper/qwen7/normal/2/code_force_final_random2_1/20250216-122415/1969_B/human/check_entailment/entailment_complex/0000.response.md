Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the function `func_1` does not accurately calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The function attempts to calculate the cost based on the counts of zeros and ones, but this approach does not account for the actual minimum cost required to sort the string via cyclic shifts.
   
2. **Misunderstanding Cyclic Shifts**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts, which means moving substrings around. The current implementation does not simulate or compute these shifts.

3. **Algorithm Mismatch**: The provided solution seems to be attempting a different algorithm that does not align with the problem requirements. It incorrectly sums counts without considering the necessary cyclic shifts.

To correctly solve the problem, we would need an algorithm that simulates or identifies the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to sort the string. This typically involves identifying segments that need to be shifted and calculating their costs.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
