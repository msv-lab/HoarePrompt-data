Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the integer part of the input split by `:`, `m` is the integer part of the input split by `:`. If `h` is 0, then `day` is set to 'AM' and `h` is set to 12. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is set to 'PM' and `h` is adjusted to `h - 12`. If `h` is 12 or less, then `day` remains unchanged.
