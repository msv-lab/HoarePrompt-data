Based on the initial state described, the `dp` list is constructed such that each element `dp[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `m`) is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for all `i` from 3 to `m`.

When the `print(dp[m])` statement is executed, it will print the value of `dp[m]`, which is the last element in the `dp` list. This value is determined by the recursive formula provided.

However, since the exact values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are not specified, and the computation of `dp[m]` depends on the previous elements in the list, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `dp[m]`. Instead, we describe it in terms of the formula used to compute it.

Output: **(dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
