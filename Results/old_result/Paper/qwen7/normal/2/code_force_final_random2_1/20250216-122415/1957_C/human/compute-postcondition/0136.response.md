Output State: **`dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` with `i` being `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The given code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This means that the value of `dp[i]` is now determined by the previous two elements in the sequence (`dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`) and the current index `i`. The initial state of `dp[i]` being calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` with `i` being `i + 1` remains unchanged, but now `dp[i]` has a new value based on the formula. All other variables remain in their initial state.
