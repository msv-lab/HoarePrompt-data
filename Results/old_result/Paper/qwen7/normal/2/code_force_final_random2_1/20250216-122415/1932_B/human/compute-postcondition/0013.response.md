Output State: **`results` is now a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus 1, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 5, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, `n` is converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 4, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 5. The values of other variables (`results`, `t`, `data`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
