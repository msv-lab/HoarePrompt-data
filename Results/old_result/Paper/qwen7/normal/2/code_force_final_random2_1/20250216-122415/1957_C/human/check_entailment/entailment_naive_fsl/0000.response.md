Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of remaining positions `m` is greater than 2. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in the `dp` array only handles the cases where `m` is 1 or 2, but fails to generalize for larger values of `m`. For example, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2
  1 2
  2 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The remaining positions after the moves are (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4). The number of remaining positions is 6, so `m = 6`.
  - The correct number of configurations is calculated as \(6!\) (factorial of 6) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

However, the program uses a hardcoded approach for `m > 2`, which is incorrect. The correct solution would involve calculating the factorial of `m` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for `m > 2`.

Here's a corrected version of the program that handles all cases correctly:

```python
def factorial_modulo(n, mod=10**9 + 7):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fact = (fact * i) % mod
    return fact

def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        elif m == 2:
            print(3)
        else:
            print(factorial_modulo(m) % (10**9 + 7))

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the factorial of `m` for `m > 2` using a loop, ensuring that all cases are handled correctly.
