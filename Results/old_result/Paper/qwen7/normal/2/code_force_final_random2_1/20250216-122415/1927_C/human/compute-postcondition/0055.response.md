Output State: **`results` now contains 'NO', 'NO'; `total_distinct` remains unchanged; `unique_a` is a set containing the elements of `a`; `unique_b` is now a set containing the elements of `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is now a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `both` is the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`; `results` now contains 'NO', 'NO'**.

Explanation: The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Since the initial state of `results` was `['NO', 'NO']`, after appending `'NO'`, `results` becomes `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`. The other variables (`total_distinct`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `both`, `only_a`, `only_b`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
