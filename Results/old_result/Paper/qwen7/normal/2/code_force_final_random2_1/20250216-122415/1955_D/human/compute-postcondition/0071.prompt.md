Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `E` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements that are present in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`; `D` remains unchanged; `cnt_aa` remains unchanged; `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_bb`, and `pairs_in_D` remain unchanged; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` else `fnd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `pairs_in_D` is either increased by 1 or decreased by 1 depending on the condition; `C[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` may be updated according to the condition; `aa` must have at least `n` elements, `m` must be less than `n`, and `n - m` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` and either `E[out_aa] > 0` or `E[out_aa] <= 0`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `pairs_in_D` is adjusted accordingly (either increased or decreased by 1). `C[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` may be updated according to the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
