Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `result` is '1000', `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `line` is the input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is `[1000, a[i-1] - T[i-1]]`**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `a` the value of `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`. Since `a` initially is `[1000]`, after appending, `a` becomes `[1000, a[0] - T[0]]`. Here, `a[0]` is `1000` and `T[0]` is the first element of the list `T`, which is an integer obtained from splitting the input `line`. Therefore, the new value of `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
