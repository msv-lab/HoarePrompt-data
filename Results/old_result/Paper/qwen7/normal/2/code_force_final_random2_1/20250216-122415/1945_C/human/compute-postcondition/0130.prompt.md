Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `final` is an empty list with an additional element 0 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` remains an empty list; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an integer divided by 2 to get `pk`; `s` is the input string; `sl` is a list containing all characters of the input string `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`; `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is set to 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((zero + 1) * 100 / (i + 2)), `zero` is increased by 1, `one` is increased by the number of non-'0' characters in `s`, `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 2)), and `lst` contains the element `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, the same values are maintained as before the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `zero` is 2, `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2, `i` is 3, `n` remains the same, `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of (2 * 100 / (3 + 1)), `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)), `lst` is [3]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `zero` is 3; `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 3; `i` is 5; `n` remains the same; `zero_perc` is 30; `one_perc` is 0; `lst` is [3, 5].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
