Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Other variables remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, and it adheres to the condition of being a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4. All other variables (`x` in this case) remain in their initial state as described in the precondition.
