Output State: **`b` is a list of length `n` that must have at least one element, `v` is the last element of the list `b`, `p` is `p * v`, `ans` is a list that now includes the value `p * v`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `p` (which is currently `p * v`) to the list `ans`. Since `v` is the last element of the list `b`, `p` is updated to `p * v`. The length of `b` and its elements remain unchanged. The list `ans` is initialized or updated to include the new value.
