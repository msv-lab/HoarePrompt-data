Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `range(t)`. The key variable here is `t`, as it determines how many times the loop will execute.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute `t` times if `t` is a positive integer. If `t` is zero or negative, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer. The initial state of `t` being an input integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to be a positive integer.

4. **Consider Other Variables**: The variables `start` and `end` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted unless they affect the loop's behavior in some way, which is not the case here.

Based on this reasoning, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `t` must be a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer, start is an integer, end is an integer such that start <= end**
