Output State: **`m` is 0, `a` is the initial value of `a` minus twice the number of iterations plus 2, `b` is the initial value of `b`, `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. Since `m` was initially 0, it gets updated to the value of the second input integer. However, the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, and the initial state of `m` (which is now reassigned) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the initial conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `s` remains as the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1`.
