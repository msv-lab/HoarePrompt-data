Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains only `b`. After executing `adj[b].append(a)`, `adj[b]` now contains both `b` and `a`, i.e., `[a]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
