Output State: **`no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `iterable` is one more than it was at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code sets `num` to 0. This directly updates the value of `num`. All other variables (`no`, `big`, `less`, and `iterable`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
