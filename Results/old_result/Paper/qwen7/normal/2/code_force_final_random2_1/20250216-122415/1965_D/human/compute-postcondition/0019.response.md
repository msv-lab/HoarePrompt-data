Postcondition: **`x` is the second element of the list `odds`, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd, `prev` is equal to the first element of the list `odds`, `idx` is decremented by 1. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is updated to `x`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both updated to \((x - prev) // 2\).**
