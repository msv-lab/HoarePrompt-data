Output State: **`t` is [], `a` is the original value of `t`, `op` is the result of performing `^=` operation with each `val >> i & 1`, `ai` is 0, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, and `op` is the final value after processing all elements in `a`.**

Explanation: The line `a, t = t, []` swaps the values of `t` and `a`. After the swap, `t` becomes an empty list `[]`, and `a` retains its original value which was the value of `t` before the assignment. All other variables (`op`, `ai`, `i`, `u`) remain unchanged.
