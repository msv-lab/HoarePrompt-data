Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts at 1 (as specified by the range function).
   - `b` is the second element of the list `info`, which is an integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `b` must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, and it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `b` must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.

So, the final state is:

**State: `t` is 1, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer equal to the second element of `info` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0**.
