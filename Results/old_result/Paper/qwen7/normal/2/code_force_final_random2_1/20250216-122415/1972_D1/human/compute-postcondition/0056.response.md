Output State: **`a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1`, `suma` is 0, and `t` is `T`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\). Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to \((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1 = (a - 2) // 4 + 1\). However, since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we keep it in the form given. All other variables remain unchanged.
