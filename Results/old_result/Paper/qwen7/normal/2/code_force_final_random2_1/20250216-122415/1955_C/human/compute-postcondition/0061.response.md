Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 2, `sunks` is 2, `a[l]` is 0, `k` is now k - 2 * a[r], `l` is increased by 1, and `a[r]` is less than `a[l]` and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop specified in the context, we assume it's part of a loop structure. The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but continues the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as before the `continue` statement was executed.
