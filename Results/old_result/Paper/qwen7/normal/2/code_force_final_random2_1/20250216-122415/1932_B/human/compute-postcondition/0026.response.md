Based on the initial state provided, `results` is a non-empty list. Since the list is non-empty, it contains at least one element. However, the specific content of the list is not given, so we cannot determine the exact value of any particular element in the list.

The print statement `print(result)` will print the first element of the `results` list because in Python, when you reference `result` without any index, it refers to the first element of the list if `result` is a single element from the list.

Given this reasoning:

Output: **[first element of results]**
