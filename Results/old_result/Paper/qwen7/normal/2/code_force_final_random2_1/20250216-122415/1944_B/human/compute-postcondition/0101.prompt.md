Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is `req`, all elements in `ans1` are duplicates of consecutive elements in `b` until `k` reaches 0 or the end of the list `b` is reached, `ans2` remains empty, the list `l` contains the first element of `b` and any elements of `b` that are not equal to their preceding or succeeding elements, unless `k` becomes 0 before processing all elements.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is -2, `c[i]` is equal to `c[0]`, and `ans2` contains the value `[c[0]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is -4, and `ans2` contains the elements `[c[2], c[2]]`. If `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, then `k` is set to -4, and `ans2` contains `[c[2], c[2]]`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `ans2` remain unchanged from the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is -4, and if `c[3]` equals `c[2]`, then `ans2` contains the element `c[3]` appended to it. If `c[3]` does not equal `c[2]`, `ans2` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
