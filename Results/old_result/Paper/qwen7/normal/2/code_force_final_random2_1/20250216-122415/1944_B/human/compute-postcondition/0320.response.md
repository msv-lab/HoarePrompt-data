Output State: **`k` is equal to `req`, `i` is 2, `n` is defined and greater than 1, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` and appends `c[2]`, and the value of `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` (which is `c[2]` since `i` is 2) to the list `ans2`. Initially, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]`. After appending `c[2]`, `ans2` now contains both `c[1]` and `c[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
