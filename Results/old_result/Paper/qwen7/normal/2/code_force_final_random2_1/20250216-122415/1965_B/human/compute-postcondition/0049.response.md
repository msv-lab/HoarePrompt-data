Output State: **`i` is 23, `idx` is 21.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over the list `nums` using `i` as the index. The loop will continue to increment `i` until it reaches the end of the list. Given that the initial value of `i` is 21, after the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will become 23 (since the list indices start from 0). The variable `idx` is only updated if `nums[i] > k`, and it is set to `i - 1`. Since the loop continues to increment `i` without further conditions to update `idx` after the first break, `idx` remains 21.
