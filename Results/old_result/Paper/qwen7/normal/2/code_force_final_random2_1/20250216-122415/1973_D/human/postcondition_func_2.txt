The function reads four integers from the standard input, splits them into a tuple, and returns it. The tuple contains integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and \( r \), where \( t \) ranges from 1 to 10^3, \( n \) and \( k \) satisfy \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), and \( r \) represents the smallest integer such that \( l \leq r \leq n \) and \( f(l, r) = x \), or \( n + 1 \) if no such \( r \) exists.
