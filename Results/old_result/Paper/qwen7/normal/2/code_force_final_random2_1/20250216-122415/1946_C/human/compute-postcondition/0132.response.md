Postcondition: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is either 50001 or 75001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is either 75001 or 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts. If the condition `numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x)` is true, then `L` becomes 75001. Otherwise, `L` remains 50001. Similarly, `R` changes to 75001 if the condition is true, and remains 100001 otherwise. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `x`, `leftover`) remain unchanged.
