Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function correctly reads the input values for `n` and `k`, and then reads the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
   - It reverses both lists, which seems unnecessary because the problem doesn't specify the order of processing, and it could be done without reversing.
   - The function calculates the cost to move Kirill to positions before the `k-th` position using the logic specified in the problem statement.
   - The logic inside the loop is correct in terms of calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to the desired position. It correctly handles the conditions where moving Kirill would result in a lower cost.
   - The final step of updating `resultado` with the minimum cost is also correctly implemented.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case, calling `func_1` for each one.
   - The loop runs `numero_testes` times, and `func_1` is called exactly `numero_testes` times, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
