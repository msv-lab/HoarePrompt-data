Output State: **`zero` is 3, `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2, `i` is 4, `n` remains the same, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)), `lst` is [3]**.

Explanation:
- `zero` is incremented by 1, so `zero` becomes 3.
- The value of `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2, but since `s` is not specified, we keep it as "increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2".
- `i` remains 4.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of (2 * 100 / (3 + 1)), which simplifies to the ceiling of 50, so `zero_perc` is 50.
- `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)), but since `o` and `n` are not specified, we keep it as calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)).
- `lst` remains [3].
