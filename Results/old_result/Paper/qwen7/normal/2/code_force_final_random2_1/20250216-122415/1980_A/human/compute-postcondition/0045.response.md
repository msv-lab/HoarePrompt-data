Output State: **`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is the value of `ans` before the addition plus the value of `m`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. Since `ans` was not initialized before this line, it is assumed to be 0 initially. Therefore, `ans` now holds the value of `m`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
