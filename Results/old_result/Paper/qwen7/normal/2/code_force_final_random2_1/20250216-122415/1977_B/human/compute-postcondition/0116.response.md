Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `s` is a list containing at least one '1' and an additional '1' has been appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since `s` initially contains at least one `'1'`, after appending another `'1'`, `s` will contain at least two `'1'`s. The variable `i` is incremented by 2, making it `i + 2`. The initial conditions for `i` and `s` are updated accordingly.
