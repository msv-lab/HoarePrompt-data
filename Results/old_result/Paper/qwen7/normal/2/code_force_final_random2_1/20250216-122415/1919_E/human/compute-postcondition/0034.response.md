Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is the next element in `results`.
- `t` is the total number of iterations (length of `results`).
- `n` is the integer from `data[3]`.
- `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration.
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.

The `print(res)` statement will print the next element in the `results` list. Since `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `res` will be the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the current iteration.

However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, `p`, or the specific implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `res`.

Therefore, the output will be the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the current iteration.

Output: **the return value of func_1(n, p) for the current iteration**
