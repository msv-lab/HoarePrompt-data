Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `y` will be equal to `n`, `b` will hold the maximum value found in the list `l` where `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was true, and `a` will hold the second maximum value among the first, third, and any value greater than both `a` and `b` encountered during the loop. The variable `c` will count how many elements in the list `l` are greater than both `a` and `b`. The variable `x` will be `n - 1` since it increments from `y + 1` until it reaches `n - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes:
- `y` will be `n`.
- `b` will be the highest value in the list `l` that satisfies `l[y] > l[y - 1]`.
- `a` will be the second highest value in the list `l` that is either the initial value of `a`, or a value greater than both `a` and `b`.
- `c` will be the count of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.
- `x` will be `n - 1`.
