Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic for determining the winner based on the optimal moves of Ron and Hermione. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the number of moves from the start node to the end of the tree and back, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```

In this case, the tree can be visualized as an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. If the stone starts at node 5, the optimal moves would be to move the stone to node 4, then to node 3, and so on. However, the program incorrectly calculates the distance to the end of the tree and back, leading to an incorrect determination of the winner.

To correctly implement the game logic, the program needs to simulate the moves and determine the winner based on the parity of the number of moves available from the starting node to the end of the tree and back. The current implementation does not properly simulate these moves and instead uses a simplified distance calculation, which is insufficient for determining the winner.
