Reasoning:
The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case, and calls the function `func_1` to determine the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of the coins. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of coins facing up ('U') and checks if this count is odd. According to the problem statement, if the number of coins facing up is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, she will not win (Bob will win).

Given the logic in the function `func_1`, the program correctly implements the solution for the problem. The function accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the number of coins facing up, which aligns with the rules provided.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
