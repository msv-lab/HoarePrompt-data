Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is -1, `tot` is the length of `num`.

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `i` until it encounters a non-zero digit or reaches the beginning of the string. After the loop completes, `i` will be -1 (since it starts from `len(num) - 1` and keeps decrementing), and `tot` will be equal to the length of `num` because the loop increments `tot` each time it encounters a '0' at the end of the string.
