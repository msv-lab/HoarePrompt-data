Output State: **`u` is False, `c` is the first return value from function `r()`, `d` is the second return value from function `r()`**.

Explanation: The code `c, d = r()` assigns the return values of the function `r()` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `r()` returns two values, `c` is assigned the first return value and `d` is assigned the second return value. The variable `u` remains unchanged and is still `False`. The initial values of `c` and `d` are not specified, so they are described as the return values from the function `r()`. The list `a` is not affected by this code.
