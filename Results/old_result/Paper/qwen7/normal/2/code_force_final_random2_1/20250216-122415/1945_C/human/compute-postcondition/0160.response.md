Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` and `mini` are undefined, `final` is a sorted list containing 0, and the length of `final` is 1; `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

The code `final.append(0)` adds the integer 0 to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending 0, it now contains the single element 0. The length of `final` is now 1. The other variables (`lst`, `pk`, `mini`, and `c1`) remain unchanged.
