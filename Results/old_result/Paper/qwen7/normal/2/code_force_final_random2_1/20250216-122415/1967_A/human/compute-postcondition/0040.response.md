Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n-2`, `r` is set to `a[n-1]` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is never met for any `i`, otherwise `r` is set to `a[i+1]` where the condition is first met. `rem` is 0, as it is reset to 0 whenever the loop breaks. `y` is `2` if the loop does not break, otherwise it is `n-1-i`. `k` is 0 if the loop breaks due to the condition being met, otherwise it is reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations where the condition is not met. The condition `k != 0` is true.**
