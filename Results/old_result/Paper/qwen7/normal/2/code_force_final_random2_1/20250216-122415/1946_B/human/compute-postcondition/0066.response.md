Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. This means the loop variable is `x`, and it iterates over the elements of the list `a`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `tmp` is 0
   - `t` is equal to `tmp`, so `t` is also 0
   - `x` is the next element in the list `a`

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the next element in the list `a`. Since `x` was the next element in the previous iteration, it has moved to the next element in the list.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `x`, as it is the loop variable. The other variables (`tmp` and `t`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`tmp` is 0, `t` is 0, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**
