Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty according to the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `length` and the string `expression`.

2. **Calling the Function**:
   - It calls the function `func_1(expression, length)` with the string and its length.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length` as arguments.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `expression`:
     - If the character is `'+'`, it increments the counter `count`.
   - After counting the number of `+` characters, it calculates `sub` as `length - count`.
   - Finally, it returns `abs(sub - count)`.

### Correctness Analysis

To determine if the function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty, let's consider the logic and the problem requirements:

1. **Array Representation**:
   - The string `expression` represents an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.

2. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The penalty of a single array `c` of length `m` is `p(c) = |c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_m| * m`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To minimize the penalty, the optimal strategy is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero whenever possible. This way, the penalty for each subarray will be zero.

4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function counts the number of `+` characters (`count`) and calculates `sub` as `length - count`.
   - It then returns `abs(sub - count)`.

### Issues in the Function

- The function does not actually perform any splitting of the array or calculate the penalties of the subarrays.
- Instead, it simply computes `abs(sub - count)`, which does not reflect the actual penalty calculation as per the problem statement.
- The function does not consider the optimal way to split the array to achieve the minimum penalty.

### Conclusion

Given that the function `func_1` does not implement the required logic to calculate the minimum penalty, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
