Output State: **`op` is 2, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma]`, `b` is explicitly sorted, `b` is sorted again which does not change its order.**

Explanation: The code `new_median = b[ma]` simply assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since `b` is already sorted and `ma` is defined as either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, the value of `new_median` remains unchanged from its previous state. All other variables remain in their original state.
