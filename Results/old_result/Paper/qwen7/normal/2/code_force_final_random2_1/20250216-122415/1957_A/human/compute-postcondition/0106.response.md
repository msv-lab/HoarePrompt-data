Output State: **`ln` is an input integer, the final value of `shapes` is determined by the number of elements in `pl` for which the condition `d[j] >= 3` is true.**

Explanation: The code `ln = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `ln`. It does not affect the list `pl` or the list `d`, nor does it change the determination of the final value of `shapes`. Therefore, the initial state regarding `shapes` remains unchanged.
