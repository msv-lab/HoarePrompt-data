Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i`, and `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the value of `sumo` by adding `int(a[i])` to its current value. The precondition states that `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` and `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i`, and now it is increased by `int(a[i])`.
