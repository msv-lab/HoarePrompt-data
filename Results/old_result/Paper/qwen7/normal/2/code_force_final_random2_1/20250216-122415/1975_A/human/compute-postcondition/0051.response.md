Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-2` are less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.

The print statement in question is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `check_all`.

Output: **YES**
