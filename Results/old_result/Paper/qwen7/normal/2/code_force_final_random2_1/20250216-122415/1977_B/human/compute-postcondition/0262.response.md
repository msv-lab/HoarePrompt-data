Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements. If `flag` is 0 and the 3rd element (index 2) of `s` is '1' and equals the 4th element (index 3), then the 3rd element of `s` is changed to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, the 3rd element of `s` is changed to '0'. If neither condition is met, the 3rd element of `s` remains unchanged.
