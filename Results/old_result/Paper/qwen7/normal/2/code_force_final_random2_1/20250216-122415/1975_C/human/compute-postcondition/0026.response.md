Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**: From the given state before the loop, we know that `i` is equal to `n-1` and `t` is equal to `t-1`. However, these variables (`t` and `i`) are not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop itself. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

3. **Adjust the state of `n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts from 1, `i` should be set to 1 initially.

5. **State of `max` and `a`**: The variable `max` is initialized to 0, and `a` is a list of integers. These variables are not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` must be set to 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**
