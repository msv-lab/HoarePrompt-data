You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

        print(result)
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a string containing the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces, where `a` is calculated based on the input values of `n` and the list `T`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (number of elements in the list `x` + 1), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a new list `a` based on the input values and prints a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `T`.

2. **Constructing the Array `a`:**
   - The array `a` is initialized with a single element `1000`.
   - For each subsequent element in the array, the program sets `a[i]` to be `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.

3. **Reversing the Array:**
   - After constructing the array, the program reverses it before printing.

### Problem Description Analysis

- **Constraints and Requirements:**
  - \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
  - \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

- **Example Verification:**
  - For the first test case, the input is:
    ```
    4
    2 4 1
    ```
  - The constructed array `a` should satisfy:
    - \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2\)
    - \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4\)
    - \(a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1\)

  - If we initialize \(a_1 = 1000\), then:
    - \(a_2 = 1000 - 2 = 998\)
    - \(a_3 = 998 - 4 = 994\)
    - \(a_4 = 994 - 1 = 993\)

  - Reversing this gives us \(a = [993, 994, 998, 1000]\).

  - Checking the conditions:
    - \(1000 \bmod 998 = 2\)
    - \(998 \bmod 994 = 4\)
    - \(994 \bmod 993 = 1\)

  - This satisfies the conditions, but the solution provided in the example is \(a = [3, 5, 4, 9]\). Let's verify this:
    - \(5 \bmod 3 = 2\)
    - \(4 \bmod 5 = 4\)
    - \(9 \bmod 4 = 1\)

  - This also satisfies the conditions.

### Conclusion

The given program constructs an array `a` such that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\). However, the construction logic \(a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]\) might not always produce valid results within the constraints \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\). Specifically, if \(T[i-1]\) is large compared to \(a[i-1]\), the value of \(a[i]\) can become negative or too small, violating the constraint.

Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce a valid solution for all inputs.
