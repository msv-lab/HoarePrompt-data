Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer greater than or equal to 28, `arr` is [26], `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], `i` is 1.**

The code `arr.append(26)` appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially an empty list, after appending 26, `arr` becomes `[26]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
