Postcondition: `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the integer representation of the last element of `arr`, `ans` is False, and `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the value of `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
