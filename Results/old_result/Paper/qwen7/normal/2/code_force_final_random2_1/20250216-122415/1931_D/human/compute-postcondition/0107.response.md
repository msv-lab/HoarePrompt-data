The only objects in the loop head are `case` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more cases in `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is an empty array, `beautiful_count` contains the total count of numbers that meet the specified conditions across all iterations, `freq` holds the count of numbers that have specific `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs as their remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, and `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must contain at least one more element.
