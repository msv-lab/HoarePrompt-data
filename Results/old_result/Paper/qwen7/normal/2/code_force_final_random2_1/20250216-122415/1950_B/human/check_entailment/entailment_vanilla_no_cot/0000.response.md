Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution only handles the specific cases for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` and does not generalize for any `n` within the given constraints. Additionally, the solution includes a condition that prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "is not in the range" in Spanish) when `n` is greater than 4, but this does not address the requirement to output a 2n × 2n checkerboard for all valid `n`. 

To correctly solve the problem, the program should generate the checkerboard pattern dynamically based on the value of `n`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(casos):
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(2 * n):
            for j in range(2 * n):
                if (i // n + j // n) % 2 == 0:
                    print('#', end='')
                else:
                    print('.', end='')
            print()
```

This corrected program will work for any `n` within the specified range and generate the correct 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern.
