Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 remains valid, and no other variables are affected.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
            max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `max` will be the minimum value between any two consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, and the value of `n` will remain unchanged.

This means that `max` will hold the smallest value found between any two adjacent elements in the list `a` when iterating from the second element to the last element. The variable `i` will have reached the end of the list, being one less than `n`, since the loop increments `i` from 1 up to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, `max` will hold the minimum value between any two consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `n` will remain as it was initially.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The final value of `max` will be the greatest value among all pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `n-1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` will still be the original input integer, `t` will be `t - 1`, and the list `a` will be updated with integers inputted by the user. The final `max` will be set to the highest minimum value found between any two consecutive elements in the list `a` during the loop's iterations.

This means that after the loop completes, `max` will hold the largest of the minimum values of all adjacent element pairs in the list `a`, starting from the first element up to the second-to-last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
