Output State: **All elements in `palka` have been processed, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`. The list `pl` contains all unique elements from `palka`.**

In this final state, the dictionary `d` will have each unique element from the original `palka` list as a key, with the corresponding value being the number of times that element appears in `palka`. The list `pl` will contain all distinct elements found in `palka`, without any duplicates.
