Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` will be the total number of queries (q), `a` will be the last input integer for the query `a`, `b` will be the last input integer for the query `b`, and `n` will be the number of elements in the array `l`. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `l` for each iteration of the loop. The variable `c` will be 0 as it is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. For each query, `s` will be calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, otherwise `s` will be `p[b - 1]`. If `s` is greater than or equal to `2 * (b - a + 1)`, the output will be 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This process will repeat for all `q` queries.
