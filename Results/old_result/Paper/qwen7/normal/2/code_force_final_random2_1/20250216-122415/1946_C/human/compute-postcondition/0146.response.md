Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on predefined variables t, n, k, adj, x, and R. It returns nothing (None).**

This means the function `func_1` does not accept any parameters through its definition. Instead, it uses predefined variables such as `t`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `x`, and `R`. The function's behavior is to process these predefined variables, which represent a tree structure and some initial conditions, but since there are no parameters passed to the function, the functionality described here focuses on the operation's context rather than input parameters.
