Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to calculate the year in which all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially, based on their periodicities. However, the given functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not implement this logic at all. Instead, they seem to be related to processing a string with `@` and `*` characters, which is unrelated to the problem description.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 3 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The first sign occurs every 2 years, so it will occur in years 2, 4, 6, etc.
  - The second sign occurs every 3 years, so it will occur in years 3, 6, 9, etc.
  - The third sign occurs every 4 years, so it will occur in years 4, 8, 12, etc.
  - The first sign occurs in year 2, so the second sign will start occurring from year 3. The second sign will occur in year 6, so the third sign will start occurring from year 7. The third sign will occur in year 12, so the next sign (if there were more) would start from year 13.
  - Therefore, the output should be 12.

However, the program will not produce this output because it is not designed to solve the problem described. Thus, the program is incorrect.
