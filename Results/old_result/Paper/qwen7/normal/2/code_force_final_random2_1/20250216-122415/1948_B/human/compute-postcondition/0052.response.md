Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i - 1]` is the first element of `nums`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of the previous value of `arr[i-1]` converted to an integer and followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to be the first element of `nums`. Since `nums` was previously defined to contain the digits of the previous value of `arr[i-1]` converted to an integer and followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` now holds the first element of `nums`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
