Postcondition: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or the maximum of -1 and the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, `i` is 2, `u` is not 0, and `v` is even (and not odd). Additionally, if `v` is non-zero, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `cnt`; otherwise, `v` is set to 0.
