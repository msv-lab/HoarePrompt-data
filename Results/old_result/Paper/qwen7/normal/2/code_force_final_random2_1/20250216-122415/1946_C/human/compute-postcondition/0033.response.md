Output State: **`numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`; `x` is now the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, and `R` is greater than `L` by more than 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. Since `L` and `R` are defined such that `R` is greater than `L` by more than 1, and `x` was previously assigned to `L` and `R`, the new value of `x` will be the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. The conditions regarding `numCuts`, `k`, and `leftover` remain unchanged.
