The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `combined`. This means the loop will continue as long as `combined` is not empty.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `k` is 0
- `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping
- `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`
- `combined` is now one item smaller
- `item` is the last element popped from `combined`
- `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`
- `max_profit` is set to `current_profit` if `current_profit > max_profit`

For the loop to execute one more time, `combined` must still be non-empty. Since `combined` is one item smaller at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be adjusted to ensure it is still non-empty for the next iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `combined` to ensure it remains non-empty.

State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, `combined` must contain at least one item, `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, and `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` is set to `current_profit` if `current_profit > max_profit`**
