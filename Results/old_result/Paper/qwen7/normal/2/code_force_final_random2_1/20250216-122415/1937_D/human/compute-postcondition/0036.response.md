Postcondition: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` remains the same, `s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `el` becomes the character at index `n-1` in `s1`. If `el` is not '>', `totalOne` remains the same, `s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, and `suffZero` remain unchanged, `i` decreases by 1, `el` becomes the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, and `ans[i]` is calculated based on the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` as specified in the else part.**
