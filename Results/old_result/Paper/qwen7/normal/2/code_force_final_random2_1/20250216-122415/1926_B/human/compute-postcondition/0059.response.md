Output State: **`a` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `b` is 'SQUARE', `s` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code snippet `b = 'SQUARE'` changes the value of `b` to 'SQUARE'. According to the initial state, if `b` contains exactly one '1', then `a` would be 'TRIANGLE'; otherwise, `a` would be 0. Since `b` is now 'SQUARE' (which does not contain any '1'), `a` remains 0. The values of `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
