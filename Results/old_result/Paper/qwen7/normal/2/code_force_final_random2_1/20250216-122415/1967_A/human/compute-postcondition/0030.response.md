Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[3] + k // (i + 1)` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `a[3] + k // 4`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
