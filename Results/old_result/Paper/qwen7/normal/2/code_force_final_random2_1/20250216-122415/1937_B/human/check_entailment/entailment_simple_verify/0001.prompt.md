You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. Additionally, two binary strings of length n are provided, representing the values of a_{11}a_{12}...a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}...a_{2n}.

    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is 2 iterations based on the given information), `t` remains within the range of 1 to \(10^4\), `n` is the integer input by the user, and `a` is a list that contains three strings representing integers, with each string being the input provided during each iteration of the loop.

If no such index exists, `s` will be the concatenation of the entire first sublist and the last element of the second sublist. `x` will be the index `i` where the condition was last met, or `n - 1` if the condition was never met.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the two binary strings representing the grid.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Path:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` and a variable `x` to store the index where the path changes direction.
   - It iterates through the columns from 1 to `n-1` to find the first position where the grasshopper can move down (`a[1][i] == '0'`) and right (`a[0][i+1] == '1'`).
   - If such a position is found, it constructs the path `s` by taking the prefix of `a[0]` up to that position and appending the suffix of `a[1]` starting from that position.
   - If no such position is found, it constructs the path `s` by taking the entire first row and the last element of the second row.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program initializes a counter `t` to 1.
   - It then checks if there are multiple paths that yield the same lexicographically smallest string by comparing prefixes of `a[0]` with `s`.
   - If a match is found, it updates `t` to reflect the number of matching paths.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It then prints the count of paths `t`.

### Correctness Check

#### Test Case 1:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  2
  00
  00
  4
  1101
  1100
  8
  00100111
  11101101
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  000
  2
  11000
  1
  001001101
  4
  ```

#### Analysis:
- For the first test case:
  - The grid is:
    ```
    00
    00
    ```
  - The lexicographically smallest path is `000`, and there are 2 paths (both going straight down).
- For the second test case:
  - The grid is:
    ```
    1101
    1100
    ```
  - The lexicographically smallest path is `11000`, and there is only 1 path (going down at the second column).
- For the third test case:
  - The grid is:
    ```
    00100111
    11101101
    ```
  - The lexicographically smallest path is `001001101`, and there are 4 paths (various combinations of right and down moves).

The program correctly identifies the lexicographically smallest path and counts the number of such paths for each test case.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the solution for the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
