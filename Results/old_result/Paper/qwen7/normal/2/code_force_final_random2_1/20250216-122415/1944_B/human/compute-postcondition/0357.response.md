Output State: **`k` is equal to -1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `len(l)` must be at least `n`, `ans2` now contains the elements `l[n + 1]` and the element appended from `l[i]`, `ans1` appends the element `l[n + 1]` to itself, and the loop breaks out of the iteration if `k` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is `n + 1`) of list `l` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is already set to `n + 1`, the value of `i` does not change. The other variables remain unchanged except for `ans2`, which now includes the previously contained element `l[n + 1]` and the newly appended element `l[i]`.
