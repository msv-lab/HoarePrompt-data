Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is either 0 or 2, and `b` is an integer. The expression `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is evaluated:

- If `t` is 0, then `t1 = 0 * 15 - b * 4 = -4b`.
- If `t` is 2, then `t1 = 2 * 15 - b * 4 = 30 - 4b`.

Since `b` is an integer, `-4b` and `30 - 4b` are both valid expressions for `t1`. The conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and `a` and `b` are still integers from the first and second input splits respectively. The condition that `t` is no longer an odd number is already satisfied since `t` was either 0 or 2, which are even numbers.
