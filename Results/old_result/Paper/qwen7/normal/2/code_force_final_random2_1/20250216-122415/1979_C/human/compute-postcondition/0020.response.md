Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `bets`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]`
   - `bets` must be greater than 1
   - `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (since `i` starts from 0).
   - The value of `bets` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, but it must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]`, `bets` must be greater than 1, `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]`**
