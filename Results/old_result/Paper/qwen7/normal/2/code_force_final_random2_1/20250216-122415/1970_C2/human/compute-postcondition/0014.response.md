Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers \((u, v)\), `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v, u]` and `nodes[v]` contains the value `[u, v]`, `u` is an integer obtained from the input, `v` is an integer obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The line `nodes[u].append(v)` appends `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Initially, `nodes[u]` contained `[v, u]`. After appending `v`, `nodes[u]` now contains `[v, u, v]`. Similarly, `nodes[v]` initially contained `[u]`. After appending `u`, `nodes[v]` now contains `[u, v]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
