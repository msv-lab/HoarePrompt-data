Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` in the range of `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `n + 1`.
   - However, since `i` is already equal to `n`, the loop cannot execute again because the condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The variable `i` cannot be adjusted further because it is already at its maximum value (`n`).
   - The variable `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
   - The variable `c` does not need adjustment because it is computed based on the values of `i` and `n` during the loop execution.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the end of the current iteration) remains the same.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` in the range of `n`**.
