Output State: **`totalOne` is now equal to the length of `pre` minus 2, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-4`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `totalOne -= 1` decreases the value of `totalOne` by 1. Since `totalOne` was initially equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, after executing this line, `totalOne` becomes equal to the length of `pre` minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
