Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is 29, `s[1]` is '0'**

The code `s[i] = '0'` changes the value of `s[1]` from whatever it was (either '1' or '0') to '0'. Since the initial condition specifies that if `s[1]` is '1', it remains '1', and otherwise, it is '0', the code effectively sets `s[1]` to '0'. All other variables (`flag`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
