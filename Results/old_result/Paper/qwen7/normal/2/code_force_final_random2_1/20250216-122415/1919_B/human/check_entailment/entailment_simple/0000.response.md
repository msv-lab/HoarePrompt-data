### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty is calculated based on the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the string `s` has an equal number of `+` and `-`, the optimal split would be every character into its own subarray, resulting in a penalty of 0.
   - If the string `s` has more `+` than `-`, the optimal strategy is to group all `+` together and all `-` together.
   - Conversely, if the string `s` has more `-` than `+`, the optimal strategy is to group all `-` together and all `+` together.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code counts the number of `+` characters in the string `expression`.
   - It calculates `sub` as the difference between the length of the string and the count of `+` characters.
   - It then returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`.

4. **Issues in the Code**:
   - The logic does not correctly handle the optimal splitting strategy. Specifically, it does not ensure that all `+` are grouped together and all `-` are grouped together.
   - The formula used (`abs(sub - count)`) does not reflect the actual penalty calculation as described in the problem statement.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To achieve the optimal penalty, the string should be split into two parts: one part with all `+` and another with all `-`.
   - The penalty for the `+` part is `count * count` because the sum is `count` and the length is `count`.
   - The penalty for the `-` part is `sub * sub` because the sum is `-sub` and the length is `sub`.
   - The total penalty is the sum of these two values.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the optimal solution to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
