Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `prev` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is the input string, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `i + 2`, `v2` is `i`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

Explanation: The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. However, since no specific output or variable is being modified by this call, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
