To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans`.

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary containing the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`.
   - For each key `x` in `cnt`, `ans` is incremented by `max(0, x - 1)`.

2. **Calculation of `ans`**:
   - `max(0, x - 1)` evaluates to `x - 1` if `x > 1` and `0` otherwise.
   - Therefore, `ans` will be the sum of `(x - 1)` for all keys `x` in `cnt` where `x > 1`.

Given this, `ans` will be the sum of `(x - 1)` for all unique integers `x` in the list `a` that are greater than 1.

3. **Output**:
   - The print statement will output the value of `ans`.

Output: **the sum of (x - 1) for all unique integers x in the list a where x > 1**
