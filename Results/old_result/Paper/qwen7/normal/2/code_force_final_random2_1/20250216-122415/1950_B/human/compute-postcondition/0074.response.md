Output State: **`c` is 2, `casos` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The initial values of `c` and `casos` remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` is still 2, and `casos` is still a positive integer greater than 0. The variable `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user.
