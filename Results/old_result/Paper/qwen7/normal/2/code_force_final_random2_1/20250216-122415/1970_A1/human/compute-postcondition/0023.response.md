Output State: **`balance` is either 3 or 1, `details` is a list containing two tuples \[(2, -1, char), (balance, -2, char)\], `s` must contain at least one character, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character in `s` that is either '(', or a character other than '('.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple to the `details` list. The new tuple contains the current value of `balance`, `-i` (which is `-2` since `i` is `2`), and the value of `char`. Since `balance` can be either `3` or `1`, the updated `details` list will contain the tuple \((balance, -2, char)\) as its second element. The other variables (`s`, `i`, and `char`) remain unchanged.
