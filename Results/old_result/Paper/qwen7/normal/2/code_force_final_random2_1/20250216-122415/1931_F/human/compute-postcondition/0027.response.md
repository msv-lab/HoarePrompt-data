Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is `m-2 + 3`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `p1` and `p2` to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions. Therefore, `p1` and `p2` are updated to 0, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
