Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an integer; `s` is a list of 30 elements with the first element changed to '-1'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the element at index `i` of the list `s` to '-1'. Given that the initial state of `i` is 1, the first element of the list `s` (which is `s[1]`) is updated to '-1'. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
