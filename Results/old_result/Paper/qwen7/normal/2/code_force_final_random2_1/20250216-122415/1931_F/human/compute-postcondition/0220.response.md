Output State: **`i` will be incremented by 1 to become `k+2`, `idx1` and `idx2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `n` remains greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement causes the immediate exit from the loop or conditional block, while the values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
