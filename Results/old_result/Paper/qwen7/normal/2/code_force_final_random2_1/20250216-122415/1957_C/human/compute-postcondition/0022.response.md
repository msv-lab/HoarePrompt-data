Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is 5 (since it was originally either 2 or 3 and then incremented by 2), `i` is 3, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The variable `num` was incremented by 2, changing its value from either 2 or 3 to 4 or 5. Since the exact initial value of `num` is not specified, we consider both possibilities, but the final value is explicitly stated as 5 after the increment. All other variables remain unchanged.
