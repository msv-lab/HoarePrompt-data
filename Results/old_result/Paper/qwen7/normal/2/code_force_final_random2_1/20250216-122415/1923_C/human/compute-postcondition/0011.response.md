Output State: **`c` is increased by the next element in `l` plus the current value of `x`, `p` is a list containing the updated value of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(c)` appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. The value of `c` remains unchanged by this operation, but it is now stored in `p`. The other variables (`l` and `x`) remain unaffected by this operation.
