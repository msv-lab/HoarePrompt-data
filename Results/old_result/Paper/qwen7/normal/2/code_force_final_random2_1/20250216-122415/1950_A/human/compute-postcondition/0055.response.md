Postcondition: `i` is 3, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'. If `y` is greater than `z`, then `res` is set to 'peak'; if `y` is less than `z`, then `res` is set to 'stair'; otherwise, `res` is set to 'none'. Additionally, `i` must be less than or equal to 1000.
