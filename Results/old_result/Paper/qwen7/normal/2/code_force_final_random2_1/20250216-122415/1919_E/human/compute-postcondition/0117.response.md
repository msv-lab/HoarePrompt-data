Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, an integer between 1 and 5000, and `p`, a list of `n` integers where each element's absolute value is less than or equal to `n`. It initializes a `dp` list and performs iterative updates based on specific rules. After completing these updates, it calculates `final_sum` as the last element of `p` plus an offset, and returns the value at `dp[final_sum]`. This returned value represents the cumulative sum of all positive values in the original `dp` list, distributed across its indices from 1 to \(2 * n\) through multiple iterations of the loop, modulo `MOD`.**
