Output State: **`final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. Since the initial state of `final` contains all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, after sorting, `final` will still contain these elements but now they are sorted. No other variables are affected by this operation.
