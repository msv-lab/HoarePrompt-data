Output State: **`freq[n]` is now `freq.get(n, 0) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency of the element `n` in the dictionary `freq`. It retrieves the current count of `n` from `freq` using `freq.get(n, 0)` (which returns the current count if `n` is already a key in `freq`, otherwise it returns 0), increments this count by 1, and assigns the new count back to `freq[n]`. The initial state of `n` being the next element in the list `arr` and the updated frequency of `n` in `freq` are the only changes made.
