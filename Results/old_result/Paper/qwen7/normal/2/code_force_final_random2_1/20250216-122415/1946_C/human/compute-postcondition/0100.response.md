Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 50002, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `k` is an integer read from stdin, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list.**

The code initializes an adjacency list `adj` with `n + 1` empty lists. This means that for each node from 0 to `n`, there is an empty list representing the edges connected to that node. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
