Functionality: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` within the range 1 to 4. For each value of `n`, it prints a specific pattern consisting of `#` and `.` characters. If `n` is 1, it prints two lines of `##`. If `n` is 2, it prints four lines with a specific pattern. If `n` is 3, it prints six lines with another specific pattern. If `n` is 4, it prints eight lines with yet another specific pattern. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the patterns to the console.
