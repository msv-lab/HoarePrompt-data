You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` input strings, each of length 5 consisting of characters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, it counts the number of 'A' characters and the number of non-'A' characters. If the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of non-'A' characters, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all strings, the function does not return anything.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each string, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters `l` (for 'A') and `h` (for 'B').
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, the program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If 'A' appears more frequently, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all given examples correctly. It can handle strings with varying numbers of 'A' and 'B', including edge cases like all 'A's or all 'B's.
5. **Distinct Strings**: The problem statement mentions that all strings are distinct, but this does not affect the correctness of the program as long as the logic works for any string of length 5.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all provided test cases accurately, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
