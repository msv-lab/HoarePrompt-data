Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is an integer from the input
   - `a` is the first integer input
   - `b` is the second integer input
   - `adj[b]` contains the value `[a]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after incrementing it by 1, `i` will be 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` must still be an integer from the input and must be greater than 1.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `adj[b]` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `adj[b]` contains the value `[a]***.
