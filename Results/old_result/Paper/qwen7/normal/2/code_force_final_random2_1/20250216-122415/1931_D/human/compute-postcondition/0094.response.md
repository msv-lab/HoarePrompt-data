Output State: **`a` is a non-empty array with at least one less element (excluding the first element), `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, and the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is incremented by 1; `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `required_mod_x` to `(x - mod_x) % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
