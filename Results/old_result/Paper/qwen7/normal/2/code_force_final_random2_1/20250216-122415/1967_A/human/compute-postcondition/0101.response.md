Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, n - 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 0, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is such that the loop can execute. This means `n` must be greater than 1 (because `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues while `i < n - 1`).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input**
