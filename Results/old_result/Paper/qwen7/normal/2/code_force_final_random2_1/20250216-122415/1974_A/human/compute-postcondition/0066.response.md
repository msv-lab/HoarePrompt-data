Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is equal to `b`.
   - If `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2.
   - Otherwise, `t` is updated to `(b // 2) + 1`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split.
   - `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Calculating `t1`:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Conditions for `t`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`.
   - Depending on whether `t2 % 15 == 0` is true or false, `t` is either `t + t2 // 15` or `t + (t2 // 15 + 1)`.

Given the initial state, let's assume specific values for `a` and `b` to illustrate the process. For simplicity, let's assume `a = 10` and `b = 8`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t = b = 8` (since `b` is the second word from the input split).
   - If `t` is even, it remains `8`.
   - So, `t = 8`.

2. **Calculate `t1`:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 8 * 15 - 8 * 4 = 120 - 32 = 88`.

3. **Check Condition for `t`:**
   - Since `t1 = 88` and `a = 10`, `t1 >= a` is true.
   - Therefore, `t` remains unchanged, so `t = 8`.

4. **Final Value of `t`:**
   - The final value of `t` is `8`.

### Output:
Output: **8**
