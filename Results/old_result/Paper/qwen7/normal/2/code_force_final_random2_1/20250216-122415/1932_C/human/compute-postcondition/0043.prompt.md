You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `b` is a list of length `n`, and it contains elements from `a` based on the instructions in `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of length `n` with at least one element remaining, `v` is the first element of the list `b`, `p` is the product of all elements in the list `b`, and `ans` is a list containing the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order.
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `b` will have at most one element left (since each element is processed once), `v` will be the first (and possibly last) remaining element of `b`, `p` will be the product of all elements in the original list `b`, and `ans` will be a list containing each element of `b` multiplied by all the elements that came after it in the original list, in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list containing the product of each element in the original list `b` with all the elements that came after it in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list where each element is the product of the corresponding element in `a` and all the elements that come after it in reverse order.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing the product of each element in the original list `b` with all the elements that came after it in reverse order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
