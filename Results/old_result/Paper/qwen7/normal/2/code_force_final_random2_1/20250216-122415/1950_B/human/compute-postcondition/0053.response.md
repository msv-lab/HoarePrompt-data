Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is explicitly given as 1.
- `casos` is a positive integer greater than 0, but its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement.
- `n` is an input integer that is either equal to 1 or not equal to 2. Since the value of `n` is assigned from `int(input())`, it could be either 1 or any other number except 2, but this does not affect the print statement.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('..##')
```

This statement will print the string `'..##'`.

Output: **..##**
