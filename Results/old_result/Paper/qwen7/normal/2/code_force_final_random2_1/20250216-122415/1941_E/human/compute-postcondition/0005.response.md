Output State: **`total_costs` is now a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, and `costs` remains a list of `n` elements.**

Explanation: The code appends to `total_costs` the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list. Since the length of `costs` is at least `k`, the sum is calculated for each segment of `k` elements in `costs`. The `rows` list and the `costs` list remain unchanged.
