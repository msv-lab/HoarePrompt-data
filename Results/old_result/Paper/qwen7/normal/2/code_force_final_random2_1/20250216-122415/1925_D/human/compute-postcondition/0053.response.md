Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `m`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `b` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `f` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `sum_f` is equal to `f` (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `m` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0**
