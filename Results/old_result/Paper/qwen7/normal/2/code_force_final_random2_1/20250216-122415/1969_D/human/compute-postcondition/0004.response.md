Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, t is the length of test_cases, heap is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_2()` calls the function `func_2()`, which returns two values. These values are assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
