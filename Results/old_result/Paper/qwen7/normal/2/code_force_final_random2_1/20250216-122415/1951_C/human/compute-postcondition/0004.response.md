Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `l` is a list of sorted integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `s` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l`). Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
