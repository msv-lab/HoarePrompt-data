Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and 1, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1` and is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd`. The other variables remain unchanged. Here, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1` and is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `zr` is greater than `ol`. `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]`. Therefore, `ans[i]` is now `zeroInd - oneInd`.
