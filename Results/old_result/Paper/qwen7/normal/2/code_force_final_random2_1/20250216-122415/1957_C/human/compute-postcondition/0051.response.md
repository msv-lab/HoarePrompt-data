Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2k`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num`. If `m == 0`, then `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m == 1`, then `m` is set to 1. Otherwise, the list `dp` will be updated such that `dp[i]` for every `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive will be calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `i` will be equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be non-zero is maintained, and now `t` is one less than its original value.
