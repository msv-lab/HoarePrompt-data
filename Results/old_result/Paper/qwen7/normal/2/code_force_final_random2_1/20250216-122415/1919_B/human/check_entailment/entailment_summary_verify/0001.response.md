### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided function `func_1` is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem.

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of `+` characters in the string and calculates the number of `-` characters as `length - count`.
   - It then returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters.

2. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into subarrays such that the penalty of each subarray is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy involves splitting the array into subarrays where the sum of each subarray is zero whenever possible. This ensures that the penalty for each subarray is zero, leading to the minimum total penalty.

4. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` does not attempt to split the array into subarrays or calculate the penalties of these subarrays.
   - It only computes a simple difference between the counts of `+` and `-` characters, which does not reflect the actual penalty calculation.

Since the function `func_1` does not implement the required logic to calculate the minimum penalty, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays.
