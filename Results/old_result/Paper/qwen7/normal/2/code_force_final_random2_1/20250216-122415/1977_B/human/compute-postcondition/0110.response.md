Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < 30`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` must be less than 30.
   - `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0'.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < 30`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - Given that `i` was less than 30 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will still satisfy the condition `i < 30` unless `i` was already 29.

5. **Update the State**:
   - If `i` was 29 at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing it by 1 would make it 30, which no longer satisfies the condition `i < 30`. Hence, the loop would terminate.
   - If `i` was less than 29, incrementing it by 1 will still keep it less than 30.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we assume it was less than 29 (as it needs to execute one more time).

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `s` remains unchanged as the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `s`.

Given that `i` was less than 30 and assuming it was less than 29, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `i + 1` (which is less than 30), and `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0'**.
