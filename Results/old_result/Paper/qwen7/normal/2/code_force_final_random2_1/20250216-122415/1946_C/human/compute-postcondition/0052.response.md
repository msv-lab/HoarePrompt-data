Output State: **`L` is equal to `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, and `t` must be greater than 1.**

The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, and splits them into a list which is then unpacked into `n` and `k`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the values of `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `x`, `z`, and `t` remain unchanged, while `n` and `k` are assigned the respective integers from the input.
