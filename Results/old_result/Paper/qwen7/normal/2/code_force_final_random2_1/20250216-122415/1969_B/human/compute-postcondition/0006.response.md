Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for c in s:`. The objects involved here are `c` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `c` is the variable used to iterate over each element in the list `s`.
   - `s` is the list of integers.

3. **Understand the initial state given**:
   - `ans` is 0 (not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `cnt` is [0, 0] (not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s` (not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (not directly relevant to the loop head).

4. **Adjust the states of the objects in the loop head**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `s` must contain at least one element. This ensures that there is something for `c` to iterate over.
   - The variable `c` will take on the value of each element in the list `s` during each iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `s` must be a non-empty list (i.e., it must contain at least one element).
- `c` will take on the value of each element in the list `s` during each iteration.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty list, `c` is the first element in the list `s`**
