Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in the program does not accurately calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The program attempts to count the number of zeros and ones and calculates a value based on these counts, but this does not correspond to the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts to sort the string.
2. **Logic for Cyclic Shifts**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts of substrings. The program does not implement the logic to find the optimal cyclic shifts.
3. **Misinterpretation of the Problem**: The program seems to be trying to count something related to the distribution of zeros and ones, but it does not address the core requirement of minimizing the cost of cyclic shifts.

Given the problem statement, the solution should involve identifying the breakpoints where the string changes from '0' to '1' and calculating the cost of cyclic shifts to move these segments to their correct positions. The provided code does not achieve this.

Correctness: **False**
