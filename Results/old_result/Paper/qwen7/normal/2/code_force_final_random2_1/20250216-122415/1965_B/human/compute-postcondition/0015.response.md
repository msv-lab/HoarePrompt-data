Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is 0
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)
   - `i` is 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The other variables (`idx`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 2**
