Output State: `i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2()` + 1.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `cnt` becomes 0 (since it is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs and starts at 1). The value of `l` will be `func_2() + 1` because `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1` after each iteration, but it does not change further once `cnt` reaches 0. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
