Output State: **`v` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `n-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `v`, `n`, `k`, or `i`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
