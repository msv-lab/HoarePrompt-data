Output State: **`zero` remains unchanged, `one` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (previous_i + 2)), `one_perc` remains unchanged, `lst` remains unchanged, `i` is `previous_i + 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is updated to `previous_i + 1` before the given line of code is executed. The code calculates `zero_perc` as the ceiling of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`, which translates to `zero * 100 / (previous_i + 2)` since `i` is now `previous_i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
