Output State: **`max_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `t` is the length of `test_cases`, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and an element from `bonuses`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list called `combined` by zipping together `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. This means that `combined` will be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains one element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
