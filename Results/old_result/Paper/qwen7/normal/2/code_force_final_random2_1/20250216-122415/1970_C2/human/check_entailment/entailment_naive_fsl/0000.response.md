Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to check if a node has any active neighbors, but it does not simulate the game moves or determine the winner based on optimal play. Instead, it checks if a node is part of a structure that guarantees a win for Ron, which is not the correct approach for determining the winner of the game.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game rounds and determine the winner based on the optimal moves of both players. The current implementation does not handle the game logic, and thus it will not produce the correct output for any input.
