Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `char` and `password`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the `password` string.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `char` is the first character of `password`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the second character of `password`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `password` remains the same as it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `char` will now be the second character of `password`.

5. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - If `char` was a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password`.
   - If `char` was a letter, `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password`.
   - Since `char` is now the second character, we need to check if it is a digit or a letter and update the respective lists accordingly.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`password` is a string of length between 0 and 19 (inclusive), consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the second character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password`. Otherwise, `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password`.**
