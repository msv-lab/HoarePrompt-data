Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of `a`, with the last element of `bigList` being the same as the last element of `smallList`.**

Explanation: The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from `bigList`. Since `smallList` was initially a list of all but one of the subarray sums of `a`, with the last element of `bigList` being the same as the last element of `smallList`, after removing the last element from `bigList`, `smallList` still holds true to its definition, meaning it contains all but one of the subarray sums of `a`, and the last element of `bigList` (now second last) is still the same as the last element of `smallList`.
