Output State: **`factor` is the second prime factor of `n`, `primes` is a list containing the prime factors of `n`, `nn` is 1, `factors` contains the complete prime factorization of `n` with the exponent of `nn` incremented by 1, the generator yields `factor`, `factor` is yielded.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor` causes the value of `factor` to be yielded from the generator. Since `factor` is the second prime factor of `n`, the value of `factor` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`primes`, `nn`, `factors`) also remain unchanged. The generator yields the value of `factor`.
