Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `len(l)` must be at least `n + 2`, `ans2` contains the elements `l[n + 1]` and the element from `l[i]`, `ans1` appends the element `l[n + 1]` to itself and contains the element `l[n + 1]` and the element from `l[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is `n + 2`) of list `l` to `ans1`. Since `ans1` already contained the element `l[n + 1]`, now it will contain `l[n + 1]` and the element from `l[i]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
