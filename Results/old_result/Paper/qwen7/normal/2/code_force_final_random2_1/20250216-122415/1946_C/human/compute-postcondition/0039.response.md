Postcondition: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1). If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2 and `R` is greater than `L` by more than 1. Otherwise, `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2 and `R` is equal to `x`.
