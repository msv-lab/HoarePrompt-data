Output State: **`no` is now ['a'], `less` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `a` is an input integer, its specific value is not known, but it is added to the list `no`. All other variables remain unchanged.
