Output State: **`count` is either 1 or 2, `expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the second character in the string `expression`**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` was either 0 or 1 initially, it will now be either 1 or 2. The values of `expression` and `char` remain unchanged.
