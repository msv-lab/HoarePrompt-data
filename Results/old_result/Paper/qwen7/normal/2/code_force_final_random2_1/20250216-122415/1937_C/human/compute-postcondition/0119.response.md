Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `v2` is 1**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to `v2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid. Therefore, the updated state includes the new variable `v2` which is set to 1.
