#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, c and d are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 ≤ l[i] ≤ 10^9 for all i.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: Output State: `k` is equal to `n`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is equal to `n-1`, `li` is a list containing `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `h` will be `n-1`, indicating it has gone through all values from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` will contain `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, the final list `li` will be `[a + n * c, a + (n-1) * c + d, a + (n-2) * c + 2d, ..., a + d * (n-1)]`.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    #State: `k` is equal to `n`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is equal to `n-1`, `li` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, each calculated as `a + n * c, a + (n-1) * c + d, a + (n-2) * c + 2d, ..., a + d * (n-1)`. The list `li` is not equal to `l`.
    return 'no'
    #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), two integers `c` and `d` (1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6), and a list `l` of n^2 integers (1 ≤ l[i] ≤ 10^9 for all i). It generates a new list `li` based on the minimum value in `l`, a constant `a`, and the parameters `c` and `d`. Both `l` and `li` are then sorted. If the sorted lists `l` and `li` are identical, the function returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.
