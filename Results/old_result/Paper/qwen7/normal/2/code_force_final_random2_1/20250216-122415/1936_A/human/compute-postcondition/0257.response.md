Output State: **`mak` is 3, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
