Output State: **`s1` is an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string of length `m`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000; `s2` is the string 'i'; `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, which is `{chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the `alphabet` variable as a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The set comprehension `{chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}` creates a set with characters from 'a' to the `k`-th character in the alphabet. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
