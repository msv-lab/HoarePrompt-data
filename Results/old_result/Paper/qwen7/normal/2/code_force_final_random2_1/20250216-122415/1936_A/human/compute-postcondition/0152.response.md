Output State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is the length of `pans` + `n`, `mak` is equal to 0, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the initial input, and `s` is the final input string.**

Explanation: The line `mak = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `mak`. This updates the value of `mak` from its previous value (which was equal to `i` in the initial state) to 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
