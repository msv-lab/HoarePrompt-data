You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 30
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')
        flag = 0
        for i in range(0, 29):
            if flag and s[i] == '0':
                s[i] = '1'
                flag = 0
            if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):
                s[i] = '-1'
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        print(length)
        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by \( t \) pairs of positive integers \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) < 2^30). For each \( x \), it constructs a list \( s \) of length 30 based on the binary representation of \( x \). It then modifies \( s \) according to specific rules involving adjacent bits and updates the length of the list accordingly. Finally, it prints the length of the modified list \( s \) and the list itself.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a binary representation of `x` using a list `s`.
   - It iterates over bits from 0 to 29 (since \(2^{30}\) is the upper limit).
   - If the bit at position `i` is set (i.e., `x & (2^i)`), it appends `'1'` to `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints:**
   - The program then adjusts the binary representation to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements.
   - It uses a flag to track whether a change has been made in the previous iteration.
   - If a `1` is found followed by another `1`, it changes one of them to `-1` and sets the flag.
   - If a `1` is found followed by a `0` and the flag is set, it changes the `1` to `0`.
   - Special handling is done for the last bit if necessary.

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the adjusted array is printed.
   - The array `s` is printed, with each element converted to an integer for clarity.

### Verification:

1. **Binary Representation:**
   - The initial construction of the binary representation is correct and ensures that the sum matches `x`.

2. **Constraint Handling:**
   - The logic to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements is correct. It handles transitions between `1` and `0` appropriately and ensures the final array meets the constraints.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The special handling for the last bit and the flag management ensures that the constraints are met even in edge cases like when the entire binary representation is `1`s.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the required logic to generate an array that satisfies the given constraints and matches the input integer `x`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
