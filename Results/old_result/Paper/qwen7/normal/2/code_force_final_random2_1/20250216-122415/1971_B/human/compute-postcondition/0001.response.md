State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). The value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.
