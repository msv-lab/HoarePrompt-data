Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is greater than 0, and `heap` contains the value of `combined.pop()` if `combined` is not empty. If `combined` is empty, `k` remains greater than 0 with `heap` unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is greater than 1, and `heap` contains the value of `combined.pop()` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `heap` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is greater than 0, and `heap` now contains the value of `combined.pop()` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `heap` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
