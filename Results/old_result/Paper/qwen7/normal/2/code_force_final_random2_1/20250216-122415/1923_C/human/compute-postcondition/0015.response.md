Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `c` will be the sum of all elements in `l`, `p` will be a list containing each cumulative sum of `c` for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `c` will hold the total sum of all integers in the list `l`. Additionally, the list `p` will contain a series of values representing the cumulative sum of `c` after each iteration of the loop.
