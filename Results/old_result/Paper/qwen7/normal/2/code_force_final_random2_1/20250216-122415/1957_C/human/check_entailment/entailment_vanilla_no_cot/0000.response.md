Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of possible final configurations for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Setup**: For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
3. **Tracking Mirrored Moves**: It tracks whether the moves were mirrored (`c == r`) or not. If the moves were not mirrored, it counts them as two separate moves; otherwise, it counts them as one.
4. **Calculating Remaining Moves**: It calculates the number of remaining moves `m` which is `n - num`, where `num` is the count of non-mirrored moves.
5. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: It uses dynamic programming to compute the number of possible configurations for the remaining moves. The base cases are defined correctly, and the recurrence relation is used to build up the solution.
6. **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required by the problem statement.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the provided solution is correct and should produce the expected results for the given test cases.
