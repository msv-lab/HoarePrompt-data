Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is `n - 1` where `n` must be at least 5, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`, `c` is 0, and the element at index `x` in list `l` is either greater than both `a` and `b` and the difference between the element at index `x` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between the element at index `x` and `b`, or the element at index `x` is now equal to the previous value of `b` and is less than or equal to `a` and greater than `b`.
