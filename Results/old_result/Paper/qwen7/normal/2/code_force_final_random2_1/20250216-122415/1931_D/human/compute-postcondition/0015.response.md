Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `num` is the first element of `a`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is present in the set `freq`.**

This means that the `beautiful_count` variable has been incremented by the value found in the `freq` set at the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
