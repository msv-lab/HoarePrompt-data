Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `num` is an integer, `i` is 0, `c` is the last integer read from input, `r` is the last integer read from input, `m` is `n - num`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element `dp[i]` (for i from 1 to m) is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for all i from 3 to m.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `t` becomes 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `n`, `k`, `num`, `c`, `r`, and `m` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The list `dp` is fully populated up to the length `m + 1` with values calculated according to the given formula.
