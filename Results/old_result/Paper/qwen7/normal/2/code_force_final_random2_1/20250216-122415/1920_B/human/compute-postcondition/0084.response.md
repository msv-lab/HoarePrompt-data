Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`, `ans` is a list with one element which is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`, it means `sums` already holds this value before the append operation. After executing this line, `ans` becomes a list containing this value. The values of `i`, `k`, and the expression defining `sums` remain unchanged.
