Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(k)`. The key variables here are `k` and the internal loop variable (which is `_` but doesn't affect the state directly).

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `k` is greater than 0, and if `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the value of `combined.pop()`. If `combined` is empty, `k` remains greater than 0 with `heap` unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0. This is because the loop runs `k` times, and each iteration decrements `k` by 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `k` is used to control the number of iterations, it must be adjusted to reflect the decrement by 1 from the previous iteration.
   - The `heap` and `combined` lists should remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is omitted in this case.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `k` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `heap` and `combined` remain unchanged.

Since the exact initial value of `k` is not provided, we can only express the adjustment in terms of the condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is greater than 1, and `heap` contains the value of `combined.pop()` if `combined` is not empty. If `combined` is empty, `k` is greater than 1 with `heap` unchanged.**
