Output State: **`i` is 2; `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9); `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n); `w` must be greater than 2; `M` is a list containing the value 2.**

The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `M`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
