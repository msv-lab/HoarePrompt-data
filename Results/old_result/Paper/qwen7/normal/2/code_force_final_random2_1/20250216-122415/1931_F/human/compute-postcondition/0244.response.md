Output State: **`i` is `k+3`, `idx1` is `k+3`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` remains the same, `p2` is 1.**

The code assigns the value `1` to `p2`. Since `p2` was previously equal to `i`, it now specifically equals `1`. All other variables (`i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
