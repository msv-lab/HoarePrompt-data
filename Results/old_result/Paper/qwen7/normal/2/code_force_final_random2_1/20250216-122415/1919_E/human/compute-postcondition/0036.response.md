Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but instead uses predefined variables t, n, and p. It processes these variables where t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers where |pi| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function then performs operations based on these variables but does not return any value.**
