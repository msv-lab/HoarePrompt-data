Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated according to the following rules:
- If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`.
- If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`.
`ans` contains the value of `sums` after the update.
