Output State: **`res` is '<', `max_index` is `i`**

Explanation: The initial state sets `res` to the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, which is given as '<'. The code snippet then assigns the value of `i` to `max_index`. Therefore, `res` remains unchanged as '<', and `max_index` is updated to `i`.
