Output State: **`new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 filled with zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, and `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. Since `j` is either 0 or 1, `j - 1` will be -1 when `j` is 0, and 0 when `j` is 1. However, since `new_dp` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `2 * n + 1`, `new_dp[-1]` is effectively `new_dp[2 * n]` which is 0. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `new_dp[j - 1]`, which is now `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
