To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `h` is the integer part of the input split by `:`.
   - `m` is the integer part of the input split by `:`.

2. **Conditions for `day` and `h`:**
   - If `h` is 0, `day` is set to 'AM' and `h` is set to 12.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is set to 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `day` remains 'AM'.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```

Given these conditions, let's consider a few scenarios to determine the exact values of `h` and `m`:

- Suppose the input time is "10:30 AM". Here, `h` would be 10 and `m` would be 30. Since `h` is less than or equal to 12, `day` remains 'AM'.
- Suppose the input time is "3:45 PM". Here, `h` would be 15 and `m` would be 45. Since `h` is greater than 12, `day` is set to 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12, making `h` 3.
- Suppose the input time is "12:15 PM". Here, `h` would be 12 and `m` would be 15. Since `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
- Suppose the input time is "0:25 AM". Here, `h` would be 0 and `m` would be 25. Since `h` is 0, `day` is set to 'AM' and `h` is set to 12.

In all cases, the format `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` ensures that `h` and `m` are formatted as two-digit strings, and `day` is the correctly determined value ('AM' or 'PM').

Therefore, the output will be a string in the format `hh:mm day`, where `hh` and `mm` are the formatted hour and minute parts of the input time, and `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}**
