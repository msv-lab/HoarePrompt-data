The function reads the number of nodes \( n \) and an integer \( t \) from standard input, followed by pairs of nodes \( u \) and \( v \) representing edges in a tree with exactly two leaves. It constructs a deque representing the tree edges. Then, it reads a starting node \( start \) and calculates the minimum distances from \( start \) to the root in both directions. Depending on whether these distances are odd or even, it prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
