Output State: `i` is `w`, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and `M` is a list containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `w`. During each iteration, it checks if `q` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `i` to the list `M`. Similarly, if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `q // i` to the list `M`. After executing the loop, `i` will be equal to `w`, and `M` will contain all divisors of `q` that meet the specified condition.
