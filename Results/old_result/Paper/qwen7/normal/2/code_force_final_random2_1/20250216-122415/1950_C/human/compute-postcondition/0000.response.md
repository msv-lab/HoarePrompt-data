Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is 'AM'**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. This does not affect the value of `t`, which remains an integer between 1 and 1440. Therefore, the output state includes both the unchanged value of `t` and the new value of `day`.
