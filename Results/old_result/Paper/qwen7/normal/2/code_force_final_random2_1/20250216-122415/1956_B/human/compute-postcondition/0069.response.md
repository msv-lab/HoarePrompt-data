Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies handling multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here, only the parameters and their constraints are outlined.
