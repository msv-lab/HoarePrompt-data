Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is reassigned to `current_profit`, combined must contain at least one item less than before, `removed_item` is now equal to the last element popped from `combined`, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `current_profit` by subtracting `removed_item[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
