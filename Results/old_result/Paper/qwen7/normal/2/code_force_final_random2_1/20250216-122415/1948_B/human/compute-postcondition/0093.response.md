Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list comprehension that converts the last element of `arr` (accessed as `arr[i - 1]`) to a string, iterates over each character in that string (converted to an integer), and adds those integers to the list. It then appends the current element of `arr` (accessed as `arr[i]`) to the list. Given that `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` would be `arr[-1]` (the last element of `arr`), and `arr[i]` is `arr[0]`. Therefore, `nums` contains the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the first element of `arr`.
