Output State: **`idx` is -1, `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) plus \((1 << 20)\), \((1 << 21)\), and \((1 << 22)\), `i` is equal to 21.**

Explanation: The line `idx = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `idx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `nums` is updated to include the additional elements \((1 << 20)\), \((1 << 21)\), and \((1 << 22)\).
