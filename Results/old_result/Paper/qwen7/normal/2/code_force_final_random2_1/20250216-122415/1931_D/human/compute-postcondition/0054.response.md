Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for case in test_cases`. The variables involved in the loop head are `case` and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `results`: This is a list containing one element which is the final value of `beautiful_count`.
   - `a`: This is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).
   - `beautiful_count`: This reflects the total count of pairs \((required\_mod\_x, required\_mod\_y)\) found in the frequency dictionary `freq` during the loop's execution.
   - `mod_x`: This is the remainder when the last `num` in `a` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y`: This is the remainder when the last `num` in `a` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x`: This is \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
   - `required_mod_y`: This is equal to `mod_y`.
   - `freq`: This is a frequency dictionary updated to count the occurrences of each \((mod_x, mod_y)\) pair encountered during the loop's execution.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `test_cases`, the variable `case` will change to the next element in `test_cases`.
   - The other variables (`results`, `a`, `beautiful_count`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, and `freq`) remain unchanged from the previous iteration because they are not directly affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the variable `case` to the next element in `test_cases`.

**State:**
- `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `beautiful_count`.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).
- `beautiful_count` reflects the total count of pairs \((required\_mod\_x, required\_mod\_y)\) found in the frequency dictionary `freq` during the loop's execution.
- `mod_x` is the remainder when the last `num` in `a` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder when the last `num` in `a` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x` is \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
- `freq` is updated to count the occurrences of each \((mod_x, mod_y)\) pair encountered during the loop's execution.
- `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `beautiful_count`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\), `beautiful_count` reflects the total count of pairs \((required\_mod\_x, required\_mod\_y)\) found in the frequency dictionary `freq` during the loop's execution, `mod_x` is the remainder when the last `num` in `a` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when the last `num` in `a` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is \((x - mod_x) \% x\), `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq` is updated to count the occurrences of each \((mod_x, mod_y)\) pair encountered during the loop's execution, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`**.
