The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), along with an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it sorts the array \( a \) in descending order, calculates a series of sums based on specific conditions involving \( x \) and \( k \), and stores these sums in a list \( ans \). Finally, it prints the maximum value from this list \( ans \).
