Postcondition: `t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split and now an integer, `t` is equal to `b`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is equal to `b`. If `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `(b // 2) + 1`.
