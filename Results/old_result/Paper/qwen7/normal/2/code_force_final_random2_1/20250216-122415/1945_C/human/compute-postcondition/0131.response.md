Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in lst:`. The objects involved here are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `lst` is given as `[3, 5, n - 1]`.
   - `ele` will take each value from `lst` one by one during the loop execution.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `lst`.
   - At the start of the loop, `ele` will be set to the first element of `lst`, which is `3`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `ele` being the first element of `lst`, we need to ensure that `lst` is initialized as `[3, 5, n - 1]` and `ele` is set to the first element of `lst`.
   - The other variables (`zero`, `one`, `i`, `n`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `mini`, `t`, `final`, and `c1`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `lst` should be `[3, 5, n - 1]`.
- `ele` should be `3`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` is [3, 5, n - 1], `ele` is 3**
