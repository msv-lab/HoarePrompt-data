Output State: **`combined` now contains all elements except the last one, `item` is the last element of `combined`.**

Explanation: The code `item = combined.pop()` removes the last element from the list `combined` and assigns it to the variable `item`. After executing this line, `combined` will contain all its original elements except the last one, and `item` will hold the value of the last element that was removed.
