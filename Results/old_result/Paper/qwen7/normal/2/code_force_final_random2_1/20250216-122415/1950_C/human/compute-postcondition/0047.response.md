Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the integer part of the input split by `:`, `m` is the integer part of the input split by `:`**.

Explanation: The code changes the value of `day` to 'PM', while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `h`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
