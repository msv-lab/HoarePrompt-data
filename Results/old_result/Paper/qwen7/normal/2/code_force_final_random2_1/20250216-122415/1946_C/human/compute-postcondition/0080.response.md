Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `L` is 1
   - `R` is 100001
   - `x` is 50001
   - `numCuts` is 0
   - `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`

3. **Determine if the loop can execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to continue, `R - L` must be greater than 1.
   - Currently, `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`, which is indeed greater than 1.

Since the loop condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

**State:**
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001
- `x` is 50001
- `numCuts` is 0
- `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`

**Final Answer:**
State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`**
