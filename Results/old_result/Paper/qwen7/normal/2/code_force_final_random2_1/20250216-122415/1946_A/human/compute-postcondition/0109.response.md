Based on the initial state provided:

- `op` is explicitly set to 3.
- `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string.
- `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3.
- `ma` is the index of `b` increased by 1.
- `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]`.
- `median` is reassigned to `b[ma]`.
- `b` remains sorted (same as after being sorted).
- `i` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
- `num2` and `num` remain as input values.

The `print(op)` statement will print the value of `op`, which is explicitly set to 3.

Output: **3**
