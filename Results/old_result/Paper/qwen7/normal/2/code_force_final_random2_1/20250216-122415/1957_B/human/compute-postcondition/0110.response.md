Postcondition: **`l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is either a list with length `n` or an empty list, `ans` is a list containing either three or two elements depending on the value of `n`, `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), and `i` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3. If `n == 1`, `arr` has length `n` and `ans` contains either three or two elements depending on `n`. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` contains two elements which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is either 1, 2, 4, or 8 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`.**
