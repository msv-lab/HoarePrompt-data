Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`. For each `n` within the range 1 to 4, it prints a specific pattern. If `n` is 1, it prints two lines of double hashes. If `n` is 2, it prints four lines with alternating double hashes and dots. If `n` is 3, it prints six lines with a more complex alternating pattern. If `n` is 4, it prints eight lines with an even more intricate pattern. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value; it only outputs the patterns based on the input values.**
