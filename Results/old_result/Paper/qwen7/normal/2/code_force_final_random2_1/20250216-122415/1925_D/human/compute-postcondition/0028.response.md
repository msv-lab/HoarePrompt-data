Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f` plus `f`.**

The code `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by `f`. Since `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` now holds the sum of its previous value and `f`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
