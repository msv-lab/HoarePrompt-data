Output State: **`a` is a non-empty array (at least one element); `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. This means that `required_mod_y` now holds the same value as `mod_y`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
