Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, and `mid` is updated to (low + high) // 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to be the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The other variables (`max_profit`, `low`, `high`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
