Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`. This means that if `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can continue.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Given that `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 3 (since `2 < n - 1` implies `n > 3`).

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

7. **List the remaining variables and their states**: The other variables (`a`, `b`, and `adj[b]`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3**
