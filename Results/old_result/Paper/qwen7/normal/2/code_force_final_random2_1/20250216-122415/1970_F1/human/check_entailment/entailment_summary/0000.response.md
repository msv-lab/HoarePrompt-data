Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to simulate a Quidditch game and determine the score based on the movements and actions of players and the Quaffle.
2. The program correctly initializes the field, players, and goals based on the input.
3. The program processes each move or action according to the rules specified in the problem description.
4. The function `func_1` is used to update the position of a player based on the direction of movement. This function is correctly implemented to add the movement vector to the current position.
5. The program correctly updates the scores when a player scores a goal and prints the appropriate messages.
6. The final score is printed at the end of the game.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1` is correctly defined and used to update player positions. The logic for handling player movements, catching the Quaffle, and scoring goals appears to be consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
