You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is greater than the highest prime factor of `n` + 1; `nn` is 1; `factors` contains the complete prime factorization of `n`, where each key is a prime factor and its corresponding value is the exponent of that prime factor in the factorization; `n` must be a positive integer greater than 1 and can be any positive integer that is a product of primes.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will have exceeded the highest prime factor of `n` by at least 1, `nn` will have been reduced to 1 through successive divisions by its prime factors, and the `factors` dictionary will contain the full prime factorization of `n`.
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: `i` is greater than the highest prime factor of `n` + 1; `nn` is 1; `factors` contains the complete prime factorization of `n` with the exponent of `nn` incremented by 1; `n` must be a positive integer greater than 1 and can be any positive integer that is a product of primes.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: The loop has executed all iterations, meaning `factor` is the last prime factor of `n`. The list `primes` contains all prime factors of `n` with their respective exponents incremented by 1 in the list `factors`. The variable `nn` remains 1, and the generator has yielded all prime factors of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer greater than 1, and returns a string indicating whether n is "prime" or "not prime" based on its divisibility by numbers less than itself.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
