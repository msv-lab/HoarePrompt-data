Output State: **`combined` is now a list without its last element; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `removed_item` is the smallest element pushed into the heap; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the following rules: if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is reduced by the second value of `item`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first value of `item`.**

Explanation: The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs two operations:
1. It pushes the `item` onto the heap.
2. It pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `removed_item`.

The `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list. After the operation, `combined` is updated to exclude this last element. The `removed_item` is the smallest element that was pushed into the heap and then popped out. The `current_profit` is adjusted based on the rules specified, using the values from `item`.
