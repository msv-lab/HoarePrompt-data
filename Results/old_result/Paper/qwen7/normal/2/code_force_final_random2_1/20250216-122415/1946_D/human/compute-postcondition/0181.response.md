Output State: **`cnt` is equal to 1, `a` must contain at least one element, `val` is the first element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` xor (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise ANDed with 1)**.

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, starting from an implied initial value of 0 (since it was not specified otherwise). All other variables (`a`, `val`, and `op`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `cnt` becomes 1, while `a`, `val`, and `op` retain their original states.
