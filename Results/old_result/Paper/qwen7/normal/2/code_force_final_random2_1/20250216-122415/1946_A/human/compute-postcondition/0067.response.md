Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `new_median <= median`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `op` is 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string.
   - `b` is the sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3.
   - `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2.
   - `new_median` is `b[ma]`.
   - `median` is `b[ma]`.
   - `b` is explicitly sorted.
   - `b` is sorted again which does not change its order.

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on `new_median` and `median`.
   - Since `new_median` and `median` are both equal to `b[ma]`, the loop condition simplifies to `b[ma] <= b[ma]`, which is always false unless `b[ma]` changes.

4. **Identify Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `new_median` must become greater than `median` in the next iteration.
   - This means `b[ma]` must be adjusted such that `b[ma] > b[ma]` becomes true.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `b` is sorted and each element is increased by 3, the only way to change `b[ma]` is to modify the elements in `b` or `ma`.
   - However, since `b` is explicitly sorted and then sorted again (which does not change its order), the only way to change `b[ma]` is to increase the value of `b[ma]`.

Given the above reasoning, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `b[ma]` to be greater than its current value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`op` is 2, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`, `median` is `b[ma]`, `b` is explicitly sorted, `b` is sorted again which does not change its order.**
