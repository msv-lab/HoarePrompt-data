Postcondition: `y` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, the element at index `x` of list `l` is either equal to `a` or `b`. If the element at index `x` of list `l` minus `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `x` of list `l` minus `b`, then `a` is equal to the element at index `x` of list `l`. Otherwise, the element at index `x` of list `l` is equal to `b`, and `b` is less than or equal to `a` and greater than `b`.
