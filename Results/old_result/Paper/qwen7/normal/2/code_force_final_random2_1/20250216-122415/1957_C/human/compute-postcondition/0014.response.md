Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `c` and the second integer to `r`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its initial value of 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
