Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 remains valid, and no other variables are affected.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, and it must be within the specified range. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
