Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 1, and `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` (which is 1) to the end of the list.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` that contains elements from the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 1) to the end of the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, and `i` remain unchanged.
