Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `len(a)` must be greater than 1, we know that `a` is a list with at least two elements. The `print(a[i], end='')` statement will print the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

Since `i` is 1, the code will access the second element of the list `a` (because list indices start from 0).

Output: **[second element of a]**
