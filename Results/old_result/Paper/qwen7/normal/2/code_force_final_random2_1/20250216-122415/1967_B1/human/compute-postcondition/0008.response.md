Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer converted from input, `m` is an integer converted from input, `ans` is equal to `n` + 1 + (n + 3) // 9, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given that `b` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(n + 3) // 9`. Therefore, `ans` is now equal to its original value (`n + 1`) plus `(n + 3) // 9`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `min(n, m)` must be at least 2 still holds.
