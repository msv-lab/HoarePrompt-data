Output State: **`freq[n]` is increased by 1, `n` is the next element in the list `arr` and `freq[n]` is now `freq.get(n, 0) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency of `n` in the dictionary `freq`. Initially, `freq[n]` is increased by 1. The updated value of `freq[n]` is calculated as the current value (which was previously increased by 1) plus 1, which is equivalent to `freq.get(n, 0) + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same as the next element in the list `arr`.
