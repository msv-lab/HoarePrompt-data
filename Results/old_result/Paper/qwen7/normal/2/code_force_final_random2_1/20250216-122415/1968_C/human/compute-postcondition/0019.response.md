Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `result` is a string containing the string representations of all elements of `a` separated by spaces, and `t` must remain non-zero**.

This means that the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, but it is still required to be non-zero. The value of `result` remains unchanged as it was initially defined as a string containing the string representations of all elements of `a` separated by spaces.
