Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in p`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition given is that `i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is updated to the value of `ans` before the addition plus the value of `m`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 'A'. For the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in the string `p`. Since `p` is 'ABCDEF', the next character after 'A' is 'B'.
   - **Variable `p`**: The string `p` remains unchanged as it is the iterable in the loop. Therefore, `p` still is 'ABCDEF'.
   - **Variable `ans`**: The value of `ans` is updated based on the previous iteration but does not change within the loop itself. We don't need to adjust `ans` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `p`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEF'**
