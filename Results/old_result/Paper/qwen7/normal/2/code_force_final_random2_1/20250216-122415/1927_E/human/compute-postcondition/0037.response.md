Output State: `i` is 1, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`, `len(permutation)` is at least 4 + 2*k.

**Explanation:**
- The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of `permutation`.
- After each iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` increases by `k`, and `curr_v` increases by 1.
- Given that the loop executed 3 times, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be incremented by `k` three times, making it `3 * k` more than its initial value.
- Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 1 and increments by `k` each time, after 3 iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `1 + 3 * k`.
- However, since the loop exits when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` equals the length of `permutation`, we can say `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is exactly `len(permutation)`.
- Initially, `curr_v` was set to `len(permutation) + 1`. After 3 iterations, `curr_v` will be `len(permutation) + 1 + 3`, which simplifies to `len(permutation) + 4 - 1` (since the loop increments `curr_v` 3 times).
- Therefore, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 3 + 1` or `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations is as described.
