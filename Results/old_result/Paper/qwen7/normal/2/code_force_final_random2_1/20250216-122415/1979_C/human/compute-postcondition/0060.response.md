Output State: **`sumo` is increased by int(a[1]) + int(a[2]) + int(a[3]), `i` is 3, `bets` is a positive integer, `a[1]` is equal to `prod // a[1]`, `a[3]` is equal to `prod // a[3]`**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the value of `int(a[i])`. Given that `i` is 3, it means `sumo` is incremented by `int(a[3])`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
