Output State: **`tmp` is the maximum of its original value plus `x` and `t`, and if the current value of `tmp` is less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, `tmp` retains its value as the original value of `tmp` plus `x`.**

Explanation: The code updates `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and `t`. If the new value of `tmp` (which is the original value of `tmp` plus `x`) is less than 0, it is set to 0. Otherwise, it retains its value. The value of `t` is updated to reflect this maximum value.
