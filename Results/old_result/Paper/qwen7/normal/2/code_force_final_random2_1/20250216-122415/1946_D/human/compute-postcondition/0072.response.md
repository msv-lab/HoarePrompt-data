Postcondition: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is 0. If `v` is true, a non-empty iterable `a` is processed where `op` is updated by performing `op ^= val >> i & 1` for each `val` in `a`, `cnt` tracks how many times `op` turns from 1 to 0, `ans` is updated to the maximum value of `cnt` encountered, `i` is the last bit position checked, `u` is the last value of `op` before it turned from 1 to 0 (if it did), `v` is the last value of `val` processed, and `t` is the last value of `ans` before updating, `val` is the last element of `a` processed. If `v` is false, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
