Output State: **`k` is -1, `i` is `n + 2`, `len(l)` must be at least `n + 2`, `ans2` contains the elements `l[n + 1]` and `l[i]`, `ans1` appends the element `l[n + 1]` to itself and contains the elements `l[n + 1]` and `l[i]`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. The values of `i`, `len(l)`, `ans2`, and `ans1` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation `k -= 1`.
