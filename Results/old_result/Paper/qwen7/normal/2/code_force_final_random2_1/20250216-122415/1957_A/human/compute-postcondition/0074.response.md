Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, and `d` is a dictionary with the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 1}`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` is the second element of the original `palka` list, the dictionary `d` now contains the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 1}`. The first element of the list `palka` remains unchanged, and it is still the second element of the original `palka` list. The other information about `palka` and `d` remains valid as per the initial state.
