You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `x` is an integer, `i` is equal to `isqrt(x) + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` such that `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the maximum value of i or x // i for all divisors i of x such that n is less than or equal to x // i or i)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of positive integers \( x \) and \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^8 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq x \)). For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum value between \( i \) and \( x // i \) for all divisors \( i \) of \( x \) such that \( n \) is less than or equal to either \( x // i \) or \( i \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1` is defined but not used within the main loop. This is an issue because the function should be called with the test case details.
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters `x` and `n`, which are the difficulty of the problem and the number of sub-problems, respectively.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program calculates the maximum balance by iterating through possible divisors of `x`.

3. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The program uses a nested loop to find pairs of divisors `(i, x // i)` such that the number of sub-problems `n` is less than or equal to either `i` or `x // i`.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates the answer with `i`.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates the answer with `x // i`.
   - The program then prints the maximum balance found.

### Issues Identified:
- The function `func_1` is defined but never called within the main loop where the test cases are processed.
- The logic inside `func_1` seems to be correct for finding the maximum balance, but the function should be called appropriately.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the program, we need to call `func_1` within the main loop.

```python
from math import isqrt

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(x, n))

def func_1(x, n):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:
After making the necessary corrections, the program should work correctly according to the problem statement.

**Correctness:** **True**
