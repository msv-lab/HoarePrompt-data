Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for sz in a:`. The variables involved here are `sz` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. For the loop to start executing, `a` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `sz` will take on the values from the list `a` during each iteration. However, since we don't know the exact value of `sz` until the loop starts, we cannot directly adjust its state.
   - The list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty.

4. **Consider Other Given States**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer (this doesn't affect the loop's execution directly).
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is 1 (this doesn't affect the loop's execution directly).

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of the list `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
