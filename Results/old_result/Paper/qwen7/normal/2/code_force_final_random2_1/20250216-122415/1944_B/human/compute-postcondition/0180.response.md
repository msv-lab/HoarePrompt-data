Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i + 1], b[i + 1]]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `l` contains the element `b[i + 1]` appended to it if `b[i + 1]` is not equal to `b[i + 2]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
