Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' if any of the input strings contained exactly one '1'. Otherwise, `a` is 0.
- `b` is 'SQUARE'.
- `s` holds the last input string processed by the loop.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is `n`.
- The current value of `a` is not 0.

Since the current value of `a` is not 0, it means that one of the input strings contained exactly one '1'. Therefore, `a` must be 'TRIANGLE'.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
