Output State: **`combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, `max_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `t` is the length of `test_cases`, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `current_profit` is 0.**

The code sorts the `combined` list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
