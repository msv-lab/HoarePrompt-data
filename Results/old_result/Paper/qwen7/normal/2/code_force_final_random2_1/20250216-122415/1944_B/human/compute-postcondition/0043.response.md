Postcondition: `k` is an integer. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to `k - 2`, `b[i]` is added to the list `ans1`, and `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged (and does not equal 0), `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, and either `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` and the list `l` includes the element `b[i]`, or there is no additional change to the list `l`.
