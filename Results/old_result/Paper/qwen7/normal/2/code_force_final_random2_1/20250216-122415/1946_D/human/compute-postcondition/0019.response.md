Output State: **`op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> i & 1`; `ai` is `ai ^ val`.**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR (`^`) operation between `ai` and `val`. The initial state mentions that `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> i & 1`, which means `op` was previously updated using a similar XOR operation. However, since the exact value of `op` is not given, we only update `ai` to reflect the new value after the XOR operation with `val`.
