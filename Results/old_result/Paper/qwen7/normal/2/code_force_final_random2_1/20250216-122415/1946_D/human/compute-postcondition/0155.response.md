Output State: **`ai` is `ai ^ (val ^ val)`, `i` is 3, `op` is `op ^ (val >> 3 & 1)`, `t` is a list containing one element which is `ai ^ (val ^ val)`**

Explanation: 
- The line `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`.
- The values of `ai`, `i`, and `op` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- After appending, `t` becomes a list with one element, which is the current value of `ai`. The expression `ai ^ (val ^ val)` simplifies to `ai ^ 0` because `val ^ val` results in 0, and any number XORed with 0 remains unchanged. Thus, `t` contains `ai`.
