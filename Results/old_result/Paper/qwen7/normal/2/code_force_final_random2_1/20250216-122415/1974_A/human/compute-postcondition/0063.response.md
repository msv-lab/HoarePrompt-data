Output State: **`t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is equal to `b`, if `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2, otherwise, `t` is updated to `(b // 2) + 1`, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is `t + (t2 // 15 + 1)`**.

This means that the value of `t` is updated to its original value plus the integer division of `t2` by 15 plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
