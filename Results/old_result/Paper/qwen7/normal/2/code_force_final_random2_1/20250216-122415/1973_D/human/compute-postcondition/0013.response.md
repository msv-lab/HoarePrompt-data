Output State: **`v` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to `v`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `v` now holds the value of `n-1`, while `n` must still be at least 1, `k` remains the return value of `func_3()`, and `i` is still `n-1`.
