Postcondition: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1; `i` is either `n-2` or `n-3`; `idx1` and `idx2` are both `n-2`; `val` is either an empty list or a list containing either `['a1']` or a single tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `a1` is in `val` at index `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`; `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `n-2`, making `l` equal to `l2` if `idx1 < idx2`.**
