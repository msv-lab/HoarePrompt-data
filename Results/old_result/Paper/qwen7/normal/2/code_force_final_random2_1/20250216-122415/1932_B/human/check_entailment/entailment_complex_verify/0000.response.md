### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires calculating the year in which all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially based on their periodicities. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities to determine when all signs will align.

2. **Given Functions**:
   - `func_1` is designed to process a string consisting of `@` and `*` characters. It does not relate to the periodicities of the signs or any calculation involving LCM.
   - `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` but does not perform any calculations related to the periodicities of the signs.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
     - Input:
       ```
       1
       3
       2 3 4
       ```
     - Expected Output: 12 (as explained in the original assessment).
     - Actual Output: The program will not produce the expected output because it does not correctly compute the LCM of the periodicities.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that `func_1` and `func_2` are not solving the problem as described. They are processing strings with `@` and `*` characters, which is irrelevant to the problem.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The given program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
