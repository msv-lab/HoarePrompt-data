Output State: **`mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. This means that `required_mod_y` now holds the same value as `mod_y`. The values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
