Output State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**.

In this output state, the variable `i` remains unchanged as `j + 1`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `ans` is now a list that includes its previous elements plus one new element which is the updated value of `sums`. The value of `sums` is specifically `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
