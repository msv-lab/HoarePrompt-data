Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a specific value based on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `t`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `t`, `a`, and `b`. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific value for each test case based on their relationships, though the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information.
