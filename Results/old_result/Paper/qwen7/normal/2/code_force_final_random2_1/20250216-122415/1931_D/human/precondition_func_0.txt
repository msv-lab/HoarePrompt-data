t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; test_cases is a list of triples (n, x, y, a), where n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, x and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
