Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `val` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the iterable `a`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty iterable.
   - `op` is updated by the expression `op ^= val >> i & 1`, where `val` is shifted right by `i` bits, masked with 1, and then XORed with `op`.
   - If `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `a`, the next value of `val` will be the next element in the iterable `a`.
   - The variable `op` remains unchanged from the previous iteration because it is updated inside the loop body, but not directly assigned a new value outside the loop.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `val`, which will be the next element in the iterable `a`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` remains a non-empty iterable (since it still has elements left).
   - `op` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `val` changes to the next element in `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a non-empty iterable, `op` is updated by performing `op ^= val >> i & 1`, `val` is the next element in the iterable `a`**
