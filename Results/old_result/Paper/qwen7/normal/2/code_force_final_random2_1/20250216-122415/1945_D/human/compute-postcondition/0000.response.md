Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `numero_testes` ≤ 10^4, and we read an integer from input which is assigned to `numero_testes`.**

The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `numero_testes`. This means that the value of `numero_testes` is now updated to the integer input, while the other conditions and preconditions remain unchanged.
