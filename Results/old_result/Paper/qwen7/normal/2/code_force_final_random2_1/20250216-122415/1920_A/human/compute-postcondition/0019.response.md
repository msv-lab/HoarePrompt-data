Output State: **`innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `x` is not equal to 2.**

The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `a` is an input integer, `no` now contains this integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
