Output State: **`i` is `k+3`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, and the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not evaluated further.
