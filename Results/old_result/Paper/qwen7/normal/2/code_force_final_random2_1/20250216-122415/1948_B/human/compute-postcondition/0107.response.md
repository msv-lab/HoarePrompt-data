Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is `m - 2`, `arr` is a list with `arr[i - 1]` updated to `nums[0]`, `ans` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to `nums[0]`. Given that `i` is defined as `m - 2`, `arr[i - 1]` becomes `arr[m - 3]`. The values of `m`, `i`, `arr`, `ans`, and the condition about `nums` not being sorted remain unchanged as per the initial state.
