Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`; `k` is a positive integer; `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.**

This means that the initial conditions of `n` and `k` being positive integers with `n` greater than or equal to `k` remain unchanged. The new list `costs` is created with two elements: the first element is the result of `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.
