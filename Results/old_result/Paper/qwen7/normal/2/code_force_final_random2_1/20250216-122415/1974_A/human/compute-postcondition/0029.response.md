Based on the initial state provided:

- `t1` is either 0 or 30.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.
- `a` is an integer from the first input split.
- `b` is an integer from the second input split.

We need to determine the value of `t` based on the conditions given.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Check**: The code checks if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1 < a`, then:
     - `t2 = a - t1`
     - `t` is determined as follows:
       - If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t = t2 // 15`.
       - Otherwise, `t = (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.

2. **Possible Values of `t1`**:
   - `t1` can be either 0 or 30.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: `t1 = 0`**:
     - If `a <= 0`, then `t1` remains 0, and `t` would be 0.
     - If `a > 0`, then `t2 = a - 0 = a`, and:
       - If `a` is divisible by 15, then `t = a // 15`.
       - Otherwise, `t = (a // 15) + 1`.
   - **Case 2: `t1 = 30`**:
     - If `a <= 30`, then `t1` remains 30, and `t` would be 0.
     - If `a > 30`, then `t2 = a - 30`, and:
       - If `a - 30` is divisible by 15, then `t = (a - 30) // 15`.
       - Otherwise, `t = ((a - 30) // 15) + 1`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, let's consider a specific example where `a` is provided. For simplicity, let's assume `a = 45`.

- **If `t1 = 0`**:
  - `t2 = 45 - 0 = 45`.
  - Since 45 is divisible by 15, `t = 45 // 15 = 3`.

- **If `t1 = 30`**:
  - `t2 = 45 - 30 = 15`.
  - Since 15 is divisible by 15, `t = 15 // 15 = 1`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not specified, we can generalize the result based on the possible values of `t1` and `a`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `t` depends on the value of `a` relative to `t1`. Given the conditions, `t` can be any non-negative integer depending on the divisibility of `a - t1` by 15.

Output: **t (where t is determined based on the value of a - t1 being divisible by 15 or not)**
