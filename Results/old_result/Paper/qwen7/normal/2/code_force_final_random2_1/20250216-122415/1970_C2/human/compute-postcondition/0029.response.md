Output State: **`nodes` must contain at least one key, and `key` will be the next key in `nodes`; `leaves` now contains the key that was appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the `key` to the `leaves` list. Since `nodes` must contain at least one key and `key` is the next key in `nodes`, after executing the line `leaves.append(key)`, `leaves` will include the `key`. The precondition that `nodes` must contain at least one key remains unchanged.
