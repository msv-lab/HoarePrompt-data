Postcondition: **`c` is 1, `casos` must be a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that is either equal to 1 or not equal to 2, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since the conditions and assignments do not change within the if-else block. The if and else parts do not alter the values of `c`, `casos`, or `n` beyond what is already stated in the precondition.
