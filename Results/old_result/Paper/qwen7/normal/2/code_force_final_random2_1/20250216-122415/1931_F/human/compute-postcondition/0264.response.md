Output State: **`idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list, and if `idx1` is `-1`, then `idx2` is not `-1`.**

Explanation: The code sets `idx2` to `n - 2`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `idx2` is now `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition regarding `idx1` and `idx2` also remains valid.
