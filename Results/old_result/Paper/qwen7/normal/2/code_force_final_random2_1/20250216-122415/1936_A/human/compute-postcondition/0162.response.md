Output State: **`i` is equal to `mak + 1`; `mak` is now equal to `i`; `len(pans)` must be greater than `mak + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `mak + 1`) to the variable `mak`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition `len(pans) > mak + 1` still holds true.
