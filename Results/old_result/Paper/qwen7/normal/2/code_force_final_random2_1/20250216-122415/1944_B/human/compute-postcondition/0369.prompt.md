Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. Additionally, an array a of length 2n is given, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    if b[0] != b[1]:
        l.append(b[0])
    if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    else:
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        k -= 2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
            l.append(b[i])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
        k -= 1
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is -2 * (len(l) - 1), `ans1` is a list that includes all elements from `l`, and `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `k` is -2 * (number of consecutive pairs found), `ans1` contains all elements of list `l`, and `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive identical elements found in list `l`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `l`, indicating that the loop has processed every element in the list. The variable `k` will be -2 times the number of consecutive pairs found in the list, as per the given rule. The list `ans1` will contain all elements of the original list `l` in the order they appeared. Similarly, the list `ans2` will contain all pairs of consecutive identical elements found in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is equal to `req - 2 * (n - 1)`, `i` is equal to `n + len(l) - 1`, `len(l)` must be at least `n`, `ans2` contains the elements from `l[n]` to `l[len(l) - 1]` if they are equal to their preceding elements, and `ans1` contains the same elements as `ans2` since `ans1` and `ans2` append the same elements from `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
