Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 2 or 1 or -1, `idx2` is 2 or 1 or -1, `p1` is 1 or 0, `p2` is 1 or 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the execution has exited the loop or if statement. All other variables retain their previous states.
