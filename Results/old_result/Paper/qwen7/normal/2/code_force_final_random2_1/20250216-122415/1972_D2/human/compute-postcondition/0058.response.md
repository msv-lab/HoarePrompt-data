Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` and `y` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. The initial conditions and the calculation for `cnt` remain unchanged because the code does not affect `cnt`. Therefore, `cnt` is still increased by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` and `y` is incremented by 1.
