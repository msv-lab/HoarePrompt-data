Output State: **`c` is increased by the next element in `l` plus the current value of `x`, `l` must have at least two elements, `p` contains the value of the new `c`.**

Explanation: The code `c += x` increases the value of `c` by the value of `x`. Since `p` contained the value of `c` before this operation, it now contains the updated value of `c`. The precondition that `l` must have at least two elements remains unchanged, and the next element in `l` was used to update `c` but is not directly referenced in the final state.
