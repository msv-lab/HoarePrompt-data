Output State: **`t` is 0, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by taking input from the user, splitting the input into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer. The original values of `t` and `bets` remain unchanged.
