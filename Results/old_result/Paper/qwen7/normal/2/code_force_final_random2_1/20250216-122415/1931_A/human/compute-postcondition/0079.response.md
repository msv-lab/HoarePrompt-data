Output State: **`j` is either 0 or 1; `lex` is between 27 and 78 (inclusive); `arr` is a list containing the elements 1, 26, and 26.**

Explanation: The code appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains either 1 or 26. After appending 26, `arr` will contain both 1 and 26, making it a list with the elements 1, 26, and 26. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
