Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>'**.

Explanation: The code `totalOne = len(pre)` calculates the length of the list `pre` and assigns it to the variable `totalOne`. This does not change the values of `s1` or `pre`. Therefore, `s1` remains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `pre` remains a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>'. The value of `totalOne` is now the length of `pre`.
