Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree is represented by a deque where the first element is `v` and now includes `u` at the left end.**

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(u)` appends the value of `u` to the left end of the deque `tree`. Initially, the first element of the deque `tree` is `v`. After appending `u` to the left, `u` becomes the new first element of the deque, while `v` remains the second element. All other conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
