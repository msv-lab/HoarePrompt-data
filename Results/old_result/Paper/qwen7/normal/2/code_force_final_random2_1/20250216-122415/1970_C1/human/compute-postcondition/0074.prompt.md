Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree is represented by an empty deque `tree`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    if empty:
        tree.append(u)
        tree.append(v)
        empty = False
    elif v == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(u)
    elif v == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(u)
    elif u == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(v)
    elif u == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the deque `tree` now contains either `u` followed by `v` or `v` as its first element, depending on whether `u` equals `tree[0]`. If `u` equals `tree[0]`, `u` is added to the left end of `tree`, otherwise `u` is appended to the right end of `tree`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `tree` is either a list or a deque with one or two elements. If `empty` is `False`, then `tree` is a list containing the elements `u` and `v`. If `empty` is `True`, then `tree` is a list or deque with one element, and if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `u` is appended to the left of `tree`; otherwise, `tree` becomes a list or deque with one element `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` and `v` are the values from the input split into integers, and `tree` is either a deque or a list with the elements `u` and `v` appended to it. If `empty` is `True`, `u` is appended to the left of `v` if `v` is the last element of `tree`, otherwise `tree` ends up with `v` followed by `u`. If `empty` is `False`, `tree` is a list or deque with one more element than before, which is the rightmost element of `tree` plus `v`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
