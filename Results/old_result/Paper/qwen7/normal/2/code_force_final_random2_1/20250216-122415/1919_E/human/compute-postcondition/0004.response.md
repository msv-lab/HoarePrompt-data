Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| ≤ `n` and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace.**

The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial states.
