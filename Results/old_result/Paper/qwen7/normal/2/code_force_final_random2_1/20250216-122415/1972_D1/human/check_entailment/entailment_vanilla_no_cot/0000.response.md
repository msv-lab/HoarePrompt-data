Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as stated:

1. **Incorrect Inner Loop Boundaries**: The inner loop in the original code snippet has `range(4, b+1)`, but the problem statement specifies that `1 \leq b \leq 2 \cdot 10^6`. This suggests that the loop should be `range(1, b+1)` instead.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Valid Pairs**: The logic inside the loops is not correctly implementing the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`. The current implementation does not properly check this condition.

3. **Formula Used in the Solution**: The formula used in the current solution (`x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`) does not seem to be derived from the problem's constraints and does not correctly count the valid pairs.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to implement an algorithm that properly checks the condition for each pair `(a, b)` within the given ranges. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

This solution iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks if they satisfy the given condition. Given the constraints, this approach might still be inefficient for very large values of `n` and `m`, but it is a correct implementation of the required logic.
