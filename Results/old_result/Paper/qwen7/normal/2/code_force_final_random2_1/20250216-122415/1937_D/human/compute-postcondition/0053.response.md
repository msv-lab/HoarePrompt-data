Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `zeroInd` as the sum of the last two elements of the list `suffZero`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
