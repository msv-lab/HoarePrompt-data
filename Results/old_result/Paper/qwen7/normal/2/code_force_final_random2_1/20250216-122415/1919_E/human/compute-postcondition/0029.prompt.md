You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Output State: The `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` is the final value after the loop completes all its iterations, and `n` is the integer value obtained from `data[3]`. The variable `t` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is an integer greater than or equal to 3 since we know it has already executed at least 3 times. The `t` value will be the sum of all `t` values from each iteration, meaning if the loop iterates `k` times, `t` will be `k`. The `n` value remains the same as it is derived from `data[3]` and does not change within the loop. The `p` list will be updated to the last list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers after the loop completes. The `data` list remains unchanged as no modifications are made to it within the loop. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, with the latest result being the most recent addition to the list.

In summary, the `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, `t` will be the total number of iterations, `n` will be the integer from `data[3]`, `p` will be the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` will remain unchanged, and `results` will be a list of results from each iteration of the loop.
```
for res in results:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
