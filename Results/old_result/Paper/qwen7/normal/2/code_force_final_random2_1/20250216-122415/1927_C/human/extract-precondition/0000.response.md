Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, m, k) representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. Arrays a and b are represented as lists of integers, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), with k being even. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.**
