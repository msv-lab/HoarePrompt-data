You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Annotated Code:

    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':

        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `b` is a list of length `n`, and it contains elements from `a` based on the instructions in `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1

    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of length `n` with at least one element remaining, `v` is the first element of the list `b`, `p` is the product of all elements in the list `b`, and `ans` is a list containing the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order.
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `b` will have at most one element left (since each element is processed once), `v` will be the first (and possibly last) remaining element of `b`, `p` will be the product of all elements in the original list `b`, and `ans` will be a list containing each element of `b` multiplied by all the elements that came after it in the original list, in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list containing the product of each element in the original list `b` with all the elements that came after it in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the instructions in `s`. Then, it calculates the product of all elements in `b` and stores these products in reverse order in a new list `ans`. Finally, it returns the list `ans` containing the product of each element in `b` with all the elements that came after it in reverse order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `a` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to handle the logic of processing the commands.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and processes each command:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element (`a[l]`) to the list `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element (`a[r]`) to the list `b` and decrements `r`.
   - After processing all commands, it calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and appends these products to the list `ans`.

3. **Product Calculation**:
   - The product is calculated in reverse order, which means the last element processed will be the first in the list `ans`.
   - The product is taken modulo `m` at each step, but this is not explicitly shown in the code. The code only appends the product without taking the modulo.

4. **Reversing the List**:
   - The final list `ans` is returned in reverse order using `reversed(ans)`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Command Processing**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly process the commands. Instead of removing elements from the array `a` as specified, it simply appends the leftmost or rightmost element to the list `b`. This means the array `a` is not being modified during the command processing.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - The product calculation should be performed on the actual array `a` as it changes with each command. However, the current implementation calculates the product on the list `b`, which is not updated correctly.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is missing in the product calculation. The problem requires taking the remainder of the product when divided by `m` at each step.

### Correct Implementation

To fix these issues, the function `func_1` should:
1. Process the commands by removing elements from the array `a` as specified.
2. Calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` and take the modulo at each step.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        product = 1
        for j in range(i + 1):
            product = (product * a[j]) % m
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
        ans.append(product)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
