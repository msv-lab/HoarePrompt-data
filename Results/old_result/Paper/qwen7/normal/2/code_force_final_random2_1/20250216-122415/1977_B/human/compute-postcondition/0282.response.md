Output State: **`i` is 2; `length` is 30; `s[2]` is '0'**

The code `s[i] = '0'` updates the element at index `i` in the list `s` to `'0'`. Given that `i` is 2, the second element in the list `s` (considering list indexing starts at 0) is now `'0'`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `length` also remains unchanged.
