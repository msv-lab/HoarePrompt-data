Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`.**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mak` now holds the value `i` which is `n-1`, while `i` itself remains `n-1`. The conditions for `n` being greater than 0 and `s` being the input string '>' are still valid. The list `pans` also remains unchanged.
