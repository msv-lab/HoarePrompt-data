The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), followed by \( k \) pairs of integers representing coordinates \( (r_i, c_i) \). It calculates the number of coordinates where \( c_i \) equals \( r_i \) and adds 2 for all other coordinates. It then computes \( m \) as \( n - \text{num} \), where \( \text{num} \) is the total count calculated earlier. Based on the value of \( m \), it either prints 0, 1, or a specific value derived using dynamic programming, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
