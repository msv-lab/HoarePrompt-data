Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `k` must be 1.
   - `cnt` must be non-zero.
   - `l` must be less than 2.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - Here, `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied that `v` must be a value that allows the multiplication with `i` to make sense in this context. Since no other constraints are given for `v`, we will assume `v` is a value that does not conflict with the conditions provided.

Given the constraints:
- `l` must be less than 2. The only integer less than 2 is 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `v` is not specified, but since `i * v` should be a valid expression, let's assume `v` is 1 (a common default value if not specified).

Therefore, the expression `i * v` would be `2 * 1 = 2`.

So, the print statement will output:
```
'? 1 2'
```

Output: **'? 1 2'**
