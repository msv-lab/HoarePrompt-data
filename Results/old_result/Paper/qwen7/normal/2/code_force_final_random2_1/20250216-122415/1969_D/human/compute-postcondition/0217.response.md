Output State: **`combined` has at least one element less than before; `heap` now contains the new last element of `combined` which replaced `item`; `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of the last element of `combined` before popping; `item` is the last element of `combined` before popping; `removed_item` is the last element of `combined` before popping, and `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `current_profit` by subtracting the first element of the last element of `combined` before popping (`removed_item[0]`). All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
