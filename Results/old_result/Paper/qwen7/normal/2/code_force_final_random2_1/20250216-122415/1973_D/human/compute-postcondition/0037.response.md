Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `k` must be 1.
   - `cnt` must be non-zero. This means `cnt` is not zero, but the exact value is not specified.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. The function `func_2()` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know `l` is one more than the result of `func_2()`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - We need to determine the value of `v`. Since `v` is not defined in the initial state, it is not clear what `v` is. If `v` is supposed to be a predefined value, it should be mentioned. For now, let's assume `v` is a variable that needs to be defined elsewhere in the code.

Given the information, we can only precisely describe `i` and `l`:
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`, where `func_2()` is an undefined function.

Since `v` is not defined, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the output will include `i * v`, which is `1 * v = v`.

Output: **'? [func_2() + 1] v' (where func_2() is an undefined function and v is an undefined variable)**
