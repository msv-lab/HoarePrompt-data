Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State Analysis
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `totalOne` is determined based on the character at index `n-1` in `s1`.
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of integers where each integer `i + 1` is added to the list if the character at index `i` in `s1` is '>'.
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element.
- `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise it remains as a list containing 0.
- `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`.
- `i` is `n-4` if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is `n-3`.
- `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne` if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.

### Loop Head Variables
The loop head variables are:
- `i`

### Adjusting States
Since the loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `-1`, the value of `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, we need to update `i` to reflect this change.

### Updated State
- `totalOne` remains unchanged because it is determined by the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, which does not change within the loop.
- `s1` remains unchanged because it is an input string and does not change within the loop.
- `pre` remains unchanged because it is built up during the loop but not modified in the loop itself.
- `preOne` remains unchanged for the same reason as `pre`.
- `suffZero` remains unchanged for the same reason as `pre` and `preOne`.
- `ans` remains unchanged because it is initialized to zeros and updated inside the loop, but not outside.
- `i` decreases by 1.
- `el` remains unchanged because it is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, which does not change within the loop.
- `ol` remains unchanged for the same reason as `totalOne`.
- `zr` remains unchanged because it is derived from `suffZero` and does not change within the loop.

### Final State
At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n-5` if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it will be `n-4`.

State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 2 if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1. `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list of integers where each integer `i + 1` is added to the list if the character at index `i` in `s1` is '>'. `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element. `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise it remains as a list containing 0. `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`. `i` is `n-5` if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is `n-4`. `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`. `ol` is `totalOne` if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`. `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**
