Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t sets of data. Each set includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. For each set, it calls `func_1(path)` to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the given periodicities and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the LCM for each set.**
