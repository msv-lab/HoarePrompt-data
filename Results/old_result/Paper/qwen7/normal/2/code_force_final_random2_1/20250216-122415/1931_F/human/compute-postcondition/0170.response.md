Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` will hold the history of all pairs (`a3`, `l3`) from each iteration, `a1` is the first element of the input split into integers, and `l1` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split into integers.**

The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes the input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a1` and the rest to the list `l1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `val` remain unchanged from the precondition.
