Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.**

The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, or `start`. The values of `n` and `t` are updated to the integer inputs from the user, but the code snippet provided does not reflect these updates in the given state. Therefore, the precondition for `n` and `t` remains unchanged in the output state, and `edges` is explicitly set to an empty list.
