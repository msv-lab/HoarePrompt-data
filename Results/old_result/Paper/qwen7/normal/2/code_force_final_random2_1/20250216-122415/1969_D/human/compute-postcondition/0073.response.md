Output State: **`combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `removed_item` is the item pushed into the heap; `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.**

This means that the `current_profit` has been reduced by the value of the first element in `removed_item`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
