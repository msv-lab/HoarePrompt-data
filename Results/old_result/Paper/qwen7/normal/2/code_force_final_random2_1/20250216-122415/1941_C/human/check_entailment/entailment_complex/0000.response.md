Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` is designed to remove the substrings "map" and "pie" from the string `s` and count the number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
- The function correctly handles the special case where `s` is exactly "mapie" by returning 1.
- For other cases, the function iterates through the string and removes all occurrences of "map" and "pie" by updating the string `s` and incrementing the counter `ans`.
- The logic for removing "map" and "pie" is correct. It uses the `find` method to locate the substrings and then constructs a new string by excluding these substrings, effectively removing them.
- The function correctly returns the total number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Given the provided annotated program and the explanation, the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
