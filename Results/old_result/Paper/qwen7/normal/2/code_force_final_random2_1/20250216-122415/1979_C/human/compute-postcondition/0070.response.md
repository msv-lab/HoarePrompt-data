Output State: **`i` is 2; `bets` is a positive integer greater than 1; `ans` is 'a[0]' + str(a[1]) + ' '**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the value of `ans` by appending `str(a[i])` (which is `str(a[1])` since `i` is 1) followed by a space to the current value of `ans`. Initially, `ans` is `'a[0]'`, so after the operation, `ans` becomes `'a[0]' + str(a[1]) + ' '`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `bets` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
