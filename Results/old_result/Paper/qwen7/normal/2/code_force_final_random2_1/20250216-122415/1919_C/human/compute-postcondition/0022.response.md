Postcondition: `n` must be at least 1, `y` is 3, the current value of `l[2]` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and the current value of `l[1]` remains unchanged. If `l[3]` is greater than `l[2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, no additional changes are made.
