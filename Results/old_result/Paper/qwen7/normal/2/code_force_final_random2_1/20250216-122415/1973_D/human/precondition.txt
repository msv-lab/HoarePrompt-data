None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, based on the problem description, the function should handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers n and k, and potentially a series of queries involving integers l and x. The function should also handle the reading of the hidden array elements and the calculation of the function f(l, r).
