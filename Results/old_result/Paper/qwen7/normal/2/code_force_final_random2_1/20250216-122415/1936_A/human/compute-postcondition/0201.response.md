Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is not explicitly given its value in the initial state.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially `n-1`, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `i`, i.e., `n > n-1` (which is always true), but more importantly, `i` should be incremented to `n-2` or lower to start the loop.
   - The initial value of `i` (`n-1`) means the loop won't execute at all unless `i` is decremented to a value less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the other variables**:
   - `mak2` and `mak` are both set to `n-1`. These values don't directly affect the loop execution, so they can remain unchanged.
   - `num_iterations` and `prev_num_iterations` are not relevant to the loop execution itself.
   - `pans` being an empty list doesn't affect the loop execution either.

Given this analysis, the key adjustment needed is to ensure `i` is decremented to a value less than `n` to allow the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is `n-2` or lower, and `n` must be greater than `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mak2` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-2`, `pans` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than `i`**
