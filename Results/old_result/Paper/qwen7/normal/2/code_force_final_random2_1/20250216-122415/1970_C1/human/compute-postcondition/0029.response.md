Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree is represented by a deque `tree` with either `v` appended to it (if `u` is not equal to `tree[-1]`) or `v` appended to it and `u` equal to `tree[-1]` (if `u` is equal to `tree[-1]`). Additionally, `u` is not equal to `tree[0]`, and the deque `tree` contains `v`.
