Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 1, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end of the list, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the next element, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a` from index 0 to the last index are less than or equal to the next element, in either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
