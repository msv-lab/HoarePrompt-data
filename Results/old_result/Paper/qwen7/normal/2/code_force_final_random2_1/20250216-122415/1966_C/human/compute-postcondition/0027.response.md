Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `tc` is used in the loop header `for tc in range(t)`.
   - There are no other variables directly modified within the loop body mentioned.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each value of `tc` from `0` to `t-1`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `tc` is less than `t`.

3. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `mexsize` is incremented each time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`.
   - The final value of `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in `a`.
   - If the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, `mexsize` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `mexsize` will be less than or equal to `maxsize`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `tc` is the loop variable, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, if `tc` was previously less than `t`, it will now be equal to the previous value of `tc` + 1.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `tc` will be incremented by 1.
- The rest of the variables (`a`, `mexsize`, `maxsize`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the loop header.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` will be incremented each time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`, the final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in `a`, if the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, `mexsize` remains as the smallest positive integer not present in `a`, otherwise `mexsize` will be less than or equal to `maxsize`, `tc` is equal to the previous value of `tc` + 1**
