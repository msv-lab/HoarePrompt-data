Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a sequence \(a\) of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - All integers from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. The provided code attempts to solve this by:
   - Generating a list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
   - Finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\).
   - Constructing the sequence using specific values derived from \(k\) and the largest power of 2 found.
   - Ensuring the constructed sequence meets the required conditions.

3. Let's analyze the construction process:
   - If \(k\) is a power of 2, say \(2^m\), the sequence includes \(2^0, 2^1, \ldots, 2^{m-1}, k, k+1, k + 2^0, k + 2^1, \ldots, k + 2^{m-1}\).
   - This ensures that all numbers from 1 to \(k-1\) and \(k+1\) to \(2k-1\) can be formed as subsequences.
   - The sequence length is 21, which is within the allowed limit of 25.

4. The code correctly handles the construction and printing of the sequence for each test case:
   - It iterates over each test case, constructs the sequence, and prints its length and elements.

5. The logic ensures that the constructed sequence meets the problem requirements:
   - No subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - All numbers from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\) can be formed as subsequences.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem.
