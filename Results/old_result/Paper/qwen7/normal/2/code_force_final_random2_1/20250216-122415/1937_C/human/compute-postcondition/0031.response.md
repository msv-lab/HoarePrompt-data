Output State: **`min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` and the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, `i` is `n`, `n` remains the same**.

Explanation: The variable `res` is assigned the value returned by the function call `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`. This changes the value of `min_indices` to include the new value of `res`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
