Output State: **`no` is an empty list, `less` is [2], `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer with the current value being 2, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 1**.

Explanation: The code `less.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `less`. Given that `a` is an input integer and its current value is 2, the list `less` becomes `[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
