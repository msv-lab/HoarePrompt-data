Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `num` which is taken from the array `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty array with at least one element (excluding the first element).
   - `mod_y` is equal to `required_mod_y`, which is equal to `mod_y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand what happens in each iteration**:
   - In each iteration, `num` takes the next element from the array `a`.
   - Since `a` is a non-empty array with at least one element (excluding the first element), it means there are still elements left in the array to be processed.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - After processing an element from `a`, the array `a` will have one less element.
   - `mod_y` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `required_mod_x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is already incremented by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that one element has been processed from `a`, making it one element shorter.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a non-empty array with at least one less element (excluding the first element), `mod_y` is equal to `required_mod_y`, which is equal to `mod_y`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, and the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is incremented by 1.**
