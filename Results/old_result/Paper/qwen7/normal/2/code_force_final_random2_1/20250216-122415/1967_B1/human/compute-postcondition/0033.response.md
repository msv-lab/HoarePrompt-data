Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is equal to `ans`.
   - `m` satisfies `min(n, m) >= 2`.
   - `b` is 2.
   - `ans` is increased by `(n + b) // (b * b)`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `b = 2` and increments `b` until `b` is greater than `min(n, m)`.
   - Since `b` is initially 2, the loop will continue as long as `b <= min(n, m)`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `b` is currently 2.
   - We need to determine if the loop should continue based on the value of `min(n, m)`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `b` is 2, the loop will continue if `2 <= min(n, m)`.
   - If `min(n, m) > 2`, the loop will continue.
   - If `min(n, m) == 2`, the loop will continue but `b` will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.

6. **New States:**
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is equal to `ans` and `ans` is not directly modified in the loop.
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop.
   - `b` will be incremented to 3 if the loop continues.
   - `ans` will be updated in the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans` without the loop body.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `b` and `min(n, m)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is equal to `ans`, `m` must satisfy `min(n, m) >= 2`, `b` is 3, and `ans` is increased by `(n + b) // (b * b)` if the loop continues.**
