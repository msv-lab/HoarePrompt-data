Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element, and the size of `a` is equal to `mexsize + 1`, `mexsize` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The initial state is that `a` must contain at least one element and its size is equal to `mexsize`. The code `mexsize = mexsize + 1` increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Therefore, the new size of `a` is now equal to `mexsize + 1`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
