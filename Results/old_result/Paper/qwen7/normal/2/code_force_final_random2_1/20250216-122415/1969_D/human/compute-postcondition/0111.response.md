Postcondition: `k` is 0, `heap` contains elements popped from `combined` during the loop's iterations if `combined` was not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` and is greater than `max_profit`. The values of `max_profit`, `test_cases`, `t`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged.
