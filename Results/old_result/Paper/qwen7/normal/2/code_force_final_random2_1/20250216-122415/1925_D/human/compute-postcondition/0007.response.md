Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`.**

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Since `f` is an integer obtained from the input split, the new value of `sum_f` is the previous value of `sum_f` plus `f`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
