Output State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` are equal to `a2`, the elements at index `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. Since `i` is initially 0, `idx1` is also 0. All other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `i`, the conditions about lists `l1` and `l2`) remain unchanged.
