Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as specified in the problem description. It checks whether the password meets the criteria of having all digits sorted in non-decreasing order, all letters sorted in non-decreasing order, and ensures that no digit comes after a letter. The function `func_1` performs these validations accurately, and the main program processes each test case appropriately.
