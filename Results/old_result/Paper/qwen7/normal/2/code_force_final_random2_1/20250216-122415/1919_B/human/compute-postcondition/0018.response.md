Functionality: **The function accepts a string `expression` consisting of "+" and "-" characters and an integer `length`. It counts the number of "+" characters in the string, calculates the number of "-" characters as the difference between `length` and the count of "+", and returns the absolute value of the difference between these two counts.**
