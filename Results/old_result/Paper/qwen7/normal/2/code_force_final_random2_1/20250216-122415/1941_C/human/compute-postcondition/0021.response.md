The only variable in the loop head is the variable `s`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop continues as long as `s.find('pie') != -1`, meaning the substring 'pie' is found in `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains the substring 'pi'. For the loop to be executed one more time, the substring 'pie' must be found in `s`. This means that the substring 'pi' must be part of a larger string that includes 'pie'.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `s` contains the substring 'pie' for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`ans` is 5; `s` must contain the substring 'pie'**
