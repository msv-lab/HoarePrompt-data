Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is increased by 1.**

The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Since `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, these conditions and assignments remain unchanged. The only change is that `num` is increased by 1.
