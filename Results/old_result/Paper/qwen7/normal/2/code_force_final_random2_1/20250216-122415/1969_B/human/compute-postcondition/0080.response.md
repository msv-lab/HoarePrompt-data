Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `c` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the state changes**: 
   - `c` is the next character in `s`.
   - `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.
   - `ans` is updated based on the conditions given.

4. **Analyze the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `s` must still contain characters (i.e., `s` should not be empty).
   - `c` will be the next character in `s`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - Since `s` is not empty at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be non-empty at the start of the next iteration.
   - `c` will be the next character in `s`.

6. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - `cnt[c]` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `ans` will depend on the values of `cnt[1]` and `cnt[0]` before the increment, but these values will change with the increment of `cnt[c]`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `s` and `c`.

**State:**
- `s` is not empty.
- `c` is the next character in `s`.

Since `cnt` and `ans` are updated within the loop body, their values will change during the execution of the loop, but they do not need to be explicitly mentioned in the loop head state.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`s` is not empty, `c` is the next character in `s`**
