Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `num` is an integer between \(k\) and \(2k\).
- `i` is \(k-1\).
- `c` is the first integer from the input split.
- `r` is the second integer from the input split.
- `m` is `n - num`, and currently, the value of `m` is 0.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(0)
```

This statement will print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
