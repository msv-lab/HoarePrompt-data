Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[0] + a[1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression `(i + 1)` evaluates to 2. Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
