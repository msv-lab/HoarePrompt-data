Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in the Counter object D, `aa` is a list of strings from the input split by spaces, `n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0, `nabors` is decremented by 1, `bb` is a list of strings from the new input split by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the count of each string in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the count of each string in `bb`, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2, `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; if `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is set to 0, otherwise `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2; `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; if `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 3, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is set to -1, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, otherwise `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2; `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; `in_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[:n - m]`; `E[out_aa]` is reduced by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `pairs_in_D` is reduced by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `C[in_aa] > 0`; otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
