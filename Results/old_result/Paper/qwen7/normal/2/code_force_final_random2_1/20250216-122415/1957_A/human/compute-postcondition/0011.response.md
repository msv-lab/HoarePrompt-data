Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. It returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4.**

Note: The `freq` dictionary is not directly provided as a parameter but is implied to be derived from the `arr` list, although the exact process of creating `freq` is not specified in the given information.
