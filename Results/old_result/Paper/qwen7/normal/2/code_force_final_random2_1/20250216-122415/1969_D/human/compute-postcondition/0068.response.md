Output State: **`combined` is now a list with one less item than before, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of the last item that was removed from `combined`, and `item` is the last item (a tuple) that was removed from `combined`.**

This means that the `current_profit` has been reduced by the value of the second element (index 1) of the last item that was removed from the `combined` list, while the `combined` list now has one less item, and `item` holds the tuple that was the last item removed.
