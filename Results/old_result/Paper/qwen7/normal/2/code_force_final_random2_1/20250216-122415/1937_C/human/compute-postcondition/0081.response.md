Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `prev` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is the input string, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `i + 2`, `v2` is `i`**

Explanation: The code `v2 = i` updates the value of `v2` to be equal to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
