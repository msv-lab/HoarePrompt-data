Output State: **`index` is 8 + 2n, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result, `p` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(n, p)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(n, p)` to the variable `result`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables from the initial state, with `result` being updated to the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
