You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and s_i ∈ {0, 1}.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `ans` will be the total count of zeros in the list `s` plus the count of ones multiplied by the initial number of zeros minus the count of ones encountered so far, `n` will be the length of the list `s`, `zeroes` will be the count of zeros in the list `s` after processing all elements, and `cnt` will contain the final counts of zeros and ones in the list `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires transforming a binary string into a sorted (non-descending) order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these operations, where the cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the shifted substring.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string (`zeroes`).
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and calculates the answer (`ans`) based on certain conditions.

3. **Key Issues Identified**:
   - The code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost of sorting the string via cyclic shifts.
   - The logic inside the loop does not accurately reflect the cost calculation for cyclic shifts.
   - The approach used in the code does not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Expected Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to identify the breakpoints in the string where the sequence changes from 0s to 1s.
   - For each breakpoint, the cost to sort the string can be calculated as the sum of the lengths of the segments between these breakpoints.
   - The total cost would be the sum of the lengths of these segments minus the length of the string plus one (since the entire string can be considered as one segment).

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Identify the indices where the string changes from 0 to 1.
   - Calculate the cost as the sum of the lengths of these segments.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as per the given requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
