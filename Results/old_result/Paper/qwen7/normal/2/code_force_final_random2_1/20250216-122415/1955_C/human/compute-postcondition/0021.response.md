Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is either 0 or 1, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[l]`, and `k` is reduced by 2 times the value of `a[l]`**.

In this output state, the value of `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[l]` from its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
