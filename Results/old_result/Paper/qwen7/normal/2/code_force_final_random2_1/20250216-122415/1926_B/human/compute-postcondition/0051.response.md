Output State: **`a` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` must be at least 1, and the count of '1' in `b` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = 'SQUARE'` changes the value of `b` to the string `'SQUARE'`. All other variables (`a`, `i`, `j`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions regarding `n` and the count of '1' in `b` also remain valid.
