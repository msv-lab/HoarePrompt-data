Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `k + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 (since `range(k + 1)` generates values from 0 to `k` inclusive).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 0, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 initially.

5. **Adjust the state of `k`**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < k + 1`. Therefore, `k` must be a non-negative integer (since if `k` were negative, the loop would never execute).

6. **Other variables**: The other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being 0 and `k` being a non-negative integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be a non-negative integer**
