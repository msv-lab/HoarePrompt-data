Output State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list plus the sum of the last `k` elements, `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, `costs` remains a list of `n` elements, `i` is `len(costs) - k`.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of the sublist of `costs` from index `i` to `i + k` (inclusive) to `total_costs`. After this operation, `i` is updated to `len(costs) - k`, which means the next iteration would start from the last element of `costs` and move backwards by `k` elements. The other variables (`rows` and `costs`) remain unchanged.
