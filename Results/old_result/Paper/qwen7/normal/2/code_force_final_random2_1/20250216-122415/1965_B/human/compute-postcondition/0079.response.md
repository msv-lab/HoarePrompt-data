Output State: **`i` is 20, `idx` is 19, `n` is an input integer (unchanged), `k` is an input integer (unchanged), `nums` is a list containing elements `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048577, k + nums[idx] + 1]`**

Explanation: The code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 19, `1 << idx` equals `1 << 19`, which is 524288. After removing 524288 from the list, the list `nums` now contains the elements `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048577, k + nums[idx] + 1]`, with 524288 removed. The other variables remain unchanged.
