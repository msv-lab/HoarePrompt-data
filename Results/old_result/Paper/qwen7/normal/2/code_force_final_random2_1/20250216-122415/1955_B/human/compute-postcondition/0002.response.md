Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `k` and the range `range(0, n)`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `k`**: Since the loop starts with `k = 0` and increments by 1 each time, the initial value of `k` should be set to 0.
3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The value of `n` must be within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `k` and `n`.

**State:**
- `k` is 0
- `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive**
