Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j in range(m)`. This means the loop variable is `j`, and the condition for the loop to continue is that `j < m`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split.
   - `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`. Therefore, `j` should be incremented to 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `sum_f` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `j` should be updated to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is 1**
