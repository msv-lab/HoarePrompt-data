Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads values for n, m, k, and a list of integers a. It then sorts the list a and calculates a cumulative value c based on the formula `sum(min(m, k) * (a[j] + t) for j in range(n))`. The function prints the final value of c for each test case and does not return any value.**
