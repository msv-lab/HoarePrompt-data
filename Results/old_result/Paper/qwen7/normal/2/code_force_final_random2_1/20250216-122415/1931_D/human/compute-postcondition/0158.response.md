Output State: **The program returns a list named 'results' which contains the total count of beautiful pairs (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) found across all iterations of the loop.**

This means that after processing all test cases and iterating through the list `a`, the program has compiled a list of counts of beautiful pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` for each number in the list according to the defined conditions. The list `results` holds these counts from all iterations, and this list is returned as the final output.
