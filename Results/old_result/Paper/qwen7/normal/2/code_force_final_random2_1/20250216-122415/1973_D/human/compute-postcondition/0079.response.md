Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is 1
   - `k` must be 1
   - `cnt` is greater than 0 - 1 (which simplifies to `cnt > -1`, meaning `cnt` is at least 1)
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 1

3. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `cnt` and `l`.

4. **Determine Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `cnt` and `l < n + 1` must be true.
   - Since `n` is 1, the condition `l < n + 1` simplifies to `l < 2`.
   - `cnt` must be greater than 0, which means `cnt` must be at least 1.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `cnt` must remain at least 1.
   - `l` must be less than 2.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `cnt` remains at least 1 and `l` is less than 2.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 2 (unchanged as it is not part of the loop head)
- `n` is 1 (unchanged as it is not part of the loop head)
- `k` must be 1 (unchanged as it is not part of the loop head)
- `cnt` must be at least 1
- `l` must be less than 2

**Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` must be at least 1, `l` must be less than 2**
