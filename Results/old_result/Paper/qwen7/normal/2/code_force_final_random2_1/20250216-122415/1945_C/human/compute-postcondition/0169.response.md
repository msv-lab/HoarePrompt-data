Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` and `mini` are undefined, `final` is a sorted list containing either an element `n` or the element 0, and the length of `final` is 1; `c1` is either greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
