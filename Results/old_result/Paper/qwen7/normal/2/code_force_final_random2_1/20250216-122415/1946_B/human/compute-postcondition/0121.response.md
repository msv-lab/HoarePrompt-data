Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is \(((s + t) \% MOD + MOD) \% MOD\), `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`, `t` is `2 * t`**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is multiplied by 2, so `t` becomes `2 * t`. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial or given values.
