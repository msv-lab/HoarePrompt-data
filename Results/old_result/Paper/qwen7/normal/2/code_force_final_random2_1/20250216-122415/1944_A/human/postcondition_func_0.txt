The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(n\) and \(k\). It reads the number of test cases \(t\) (where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it checks if \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\). If the conditions are met, it prints \(n\) if \(n - k \leq 1\), otherwise it prints 1. If the conditions are not met, it does not process the test case and moves to the next one. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each valid test case.
