Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer, `arr` is either [1, 1] or [26, 1] depending on whether `lex` is less than 28, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `arr`. Since the initial value of `arr` is either `[1]` or `[26]`, after appending `1`, it becomes either `[1, 1]` or `[26, 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, since the code is a single line and does not involve any conditional statements, the value of `i` is incremented by 1 from 1 to 2.
