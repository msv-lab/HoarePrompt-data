Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `pl`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `pl` and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `shapes` is 1 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop condition).
   - `pl` must have at least one element.
   - The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `pl` must have at least one element, for the loop to continue, `pl` must still have at least one element.
   - The current value of `d[j]` being greater than or equal to 3 means that `j` is valid for the current iteration. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented, and the new value of `d[j]` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

5. **Determine the New State**:
   - `shapes` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `pl` must still have at least one element.
   - `j` will be incremented, so it will be the next element in `pl`.
   - The new value of `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`shapes` is 1, `pl` must have at least one element, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, where `j` is the next element in `pl`**.
