Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order where each integer is between 1 and 100, and `b` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100. Depending on the conditions, the function returns either a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, or it returns the list `b`.**
