Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `lex = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `lex`. The values of the other variables (`j`, `arr`, `info`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The new value of `lex` is an integer obtained from user input, which is within the range of -25 to 26 as per the initial state.
