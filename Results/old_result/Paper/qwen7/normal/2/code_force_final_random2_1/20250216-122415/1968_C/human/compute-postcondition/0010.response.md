Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a` contains two elements where `a[0]` is `a[0] - T[0]` and `a[1]` is `a[0] - T[0] - T[1]`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `a` contains an element which is equal to `a[0] - T[0]`. After executing `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])`, the value of `i - 1` is 1, so `a[1]` is updated to `a[0] - T[1]`. Since `a[0]` is already `a[0] - T[0]`, `a[1]` becomes `(a[0] - T[0]) - T[1]`, which simplifies to `a[0] - T[0] - T[1]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
