Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` starts at 1 (as specified by the range function `range(1, b + 1)`).
   - `b` is the second element of the list `info`, which is an integer.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `b` must be at least 1. If `b` is less than 1, the loop will not run at all.
   - The initial value of `i` is already set to 1, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `b` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` is 1, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - The initial value of `t` is 1, but this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - The initial value of `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, but this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - The initial value of `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, but this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - The initial value of `a` is the first element of `info`, but this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - The initial value of `suma` is 0, but this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `b` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`b` must be at least 1**
