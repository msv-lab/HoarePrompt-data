Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]` + ... + the integer value of `a[bets-1]`, `bets` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `bets`, and `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]` + ... + the integer value of `a[bets-1]`, `bets` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `bets`, and `ans` is the string containing the values of `a[i]` concatenated with a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 0, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]` + ... + the integer value of `a[bets-1]`, `bets` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `bets`, and `ans` is the string containing the values of `a[i]` concatenated with a space, and `ans` has an additional space added to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `sumo` is increased by the sum of the integer values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[1]`, `ans` is the string containing the values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` concatenated with two spaces, and `ans` is updated by adding the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
