Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, and in either case (whether `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2` or not), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[l]`, `a[r]` is reduced by `a[l]`; if `a[r]` equals 0, `sunks` is 1, and `sunks` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1, and we continue the loop.
