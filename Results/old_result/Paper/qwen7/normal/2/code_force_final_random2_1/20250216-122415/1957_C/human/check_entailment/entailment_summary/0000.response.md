Reasoning:

1. The program correctly processes multiple test cases, reading the values of \( n \) and \( k \) for each case.
2. It then reads \( k \) pairs of coordinates \((r_i, c_i)\) and counts how many times \( c_i \) equals \( r_i \) (which means the rook cannot be mirrored) and how many times they are different (which means the rook can be mirrored).
3. The variable `num` is calculated as the sum of these counts.
4. \( m \) is computed as \( n - \text{num} \), which represents the number of remaining positions where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.
5. The program handles the special cases where \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \) directly.
6. For larger values of \( m \), it uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations. The base cases are set up correctly, and the recurrence relation is used to compute the number of configurations for larger values of \( m \).

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the correct logic to solve the problem. The dynamic programming part seems to handle the combinatorial aspect of placing rooks in a non-attacking manner, considering the constraints and the mirroring rule.

Correctness: **True**
