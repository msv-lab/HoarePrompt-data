State: **`i` is 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `i <= 1000`.
2. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= 1000` must be true.
3. Right before the loop, `i` is 1.
4. Since `1 <= 1000` is true, no adjustment to `i` is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to proceed with its first iteration.
