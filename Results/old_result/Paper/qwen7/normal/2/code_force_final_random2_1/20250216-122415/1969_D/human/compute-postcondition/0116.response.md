The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `combined`. For the loop to execute the first time, `combined` must contain at least one element.

Given the postconditions provided, `combined` could potentially be empty right before the loop starts. Therefore, we need to ensure that `combined` is not empty for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains elements popped from `combined` during the loop's iterations if `combined` was not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, and `combined` must not be empty.**
