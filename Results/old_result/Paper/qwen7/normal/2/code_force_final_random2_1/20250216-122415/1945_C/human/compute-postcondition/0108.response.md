Output State: **`zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 2)), `zero` is increased by 1, `one` is increased by the number of non-'0' characters in `s`, `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 2)), and `lst` contains the element `i + 1`.**

Explanation: 
- The line `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `zero` and `one` are updated accordingly.
- The calculation for `zero_perc` now uses `i + 2` instead of `i + 1` because `i` has been incremented.
- The calculation for `one_perc` now uses `n - i - 2` instead of `n - i - 1` because `i` has been incremented.
- All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state, except for the updated values of `zero`, `lst`, and the recalculated `zero_perc` and `one_perc`.
