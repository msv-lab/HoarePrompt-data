### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
- Convert `s` into an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
- Calculate the minimum possible penalty by splitting `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the penalty is minimized.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Counting '+' Characters:**
   ```python
   count = 0
   for char in expression:
       if char == '+':
           count += 1
   ```
   This loop correctly counts the number of `+` characters in the string `expression`.

2. **Calculating `sub`:**
   ```python
   sub = length - count
   ```
   Here, `sub` is calculated as the difference between the total length of the string and the count of `+` characters.

3. **Returning the Result:**
   ```python
   return abs(sub - count)
   ```
   The function returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`.

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before the function call and explains the logic within the function.
- However, the logic within the function does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the function does not account for the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
- The function will count 3 `+` characters and 7 `-` characters.
- `count = 3`
- `sub = 10 - 3 = 7`
- The function returns `abs(7 - 3) = 4`

However, the optimal split is:
```
([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])
```
This results in a penalty of `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays. The provided example demonstrates that the function returns an incorrect result.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect as it does not handle the problem correctly and does not find the minimum possible penalty.
