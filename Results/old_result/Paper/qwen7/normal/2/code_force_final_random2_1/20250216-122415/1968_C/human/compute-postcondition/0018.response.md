The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is true (non-zero), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is non-zero, so no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

However, since `t` is non-zero at the end of the previous iteration, we don't need to change anything about `t` to allow the loop to proceed. The key point here is to ensure that `t` remains non-zero for the next iteration.

State: **`result` is a string containing the string representations of all elements of `a` separated by spaces, and `t` must remain non-zero**
