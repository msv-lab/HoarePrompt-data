Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and it is the input integer from the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the input operation. The values of `n` and `x` are not affected by this line of code.
