Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to `len(pans)`.
   - `i` must be within the range `[1, n)`, where `n` is an input integer and `n > 0`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is the length of the list `pans`.
- Since `i` must be within the range `[1, n)`, it means `i` is a positive integer between 1 and `n-1`.

However, the code snippet does not define the variable `mak`. Given no additional information about `mak`, we cannot determine its specific value. Therefore, `mak` will be printed as is, without any further description.

Based on this analysis, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **'? mak mak i i' (where `i` is the length of the list `pans` and `mak` is an undefined variable)**
