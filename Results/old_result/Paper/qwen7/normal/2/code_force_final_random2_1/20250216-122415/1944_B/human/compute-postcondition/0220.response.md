Output State: **All elements of `l` have been processed, and `k` is either -2 * (number of consecutive pairs found) or 0. `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive identical elements found in `c`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning every index in `c` has been checked. The variable `k` will be `-2 * (number of consecutive pairs found)` if there were any such pairs, otherwise it will be 0. The list `ans2` will contain all the pairs of consecutive identical elements found in `c` during the loop's execution.
