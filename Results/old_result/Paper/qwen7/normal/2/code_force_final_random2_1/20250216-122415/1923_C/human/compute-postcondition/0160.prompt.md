Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, each test case contains n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    c = 0
    for x in l:
        c += x
        p.append(c)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        s = p[b - 1]
        if a - 2 >= 0:
            s -= p[a - 2]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` will be 0, `a` will be the initial value of `a` minus twice the number of iterations, `b` will be the initial value of `b`, and `s` will be the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1`. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of `c` for each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `m` being set to 1, `a` and `b` representing the most recent inputs, and `s` calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop body.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, otherwise `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]` and `s` is decreased by `p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0` after the loop has executed all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
