Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b
    if t % 2 == 0:
        t = t // 2
    else:
        t = t // 2 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t` is either `t2 // 15` if `t2` is divisible by 15, or `(a - t1) // 15 + 1` if `t2` is not divisible by 15.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`, and `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `t2 = a - t1` and `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is equal to `b`, if `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2, otherwise, `t` is updated to `(b // 2) + 1`, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split, `n` must be greater than 1. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`, and depending on whether `t2 % 15 == 0` is true or false, `t` is either `t + t2 // 15` or `t + (t2 // 15 + 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
