Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string consists entirely of '1's. For example, consider the input "11111". The program will output `count` as `1`, but the correct answer should be `1` since the entire string can be treated as one piece. However, the program does not account for this scenario properly. Specifically, the program increments `count` for every change in character, which is incorrect because it should only increment `count` when transitioning from '0' to '1'. Here's a counterexample:

- Input: `"11111"`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Program Output: `1` (incorrect)

To fix this, the program should only increment `count` when transitioning from '0' to '1', and it should handle strings of all '1's correctly.
