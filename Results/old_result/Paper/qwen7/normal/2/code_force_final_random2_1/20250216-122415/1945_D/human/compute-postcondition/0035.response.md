Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - k, n)`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` plus `lista_B[i]`, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `n - k` is 0, and `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `n - k` and goes up to but does not include `n`. Given that `n - k` is 0, the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 1`.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` is currently `n - k - 1` and `n - k` is 0, `i` is `-1`. However, since the loop starts from `n - k` (which is 0), the first valid value for `i` in the next iteration would be `0`.

5. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to `0`. The other variables (`soma_b` and `n - k`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` plus `lista_B[i]`, `i` is 0, `n - k` is 0**
