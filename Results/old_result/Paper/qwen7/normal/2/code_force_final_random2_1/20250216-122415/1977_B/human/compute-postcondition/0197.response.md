Based on the initial state provided:

- `flag` is 0
- `i` is 30
- `n` is 29
- `s[1]` is '0'
- `s[29]` is '1'
- `s[30]` is '0'
- The length of the string `s` is greater than 30

The `print(*s)` statement will unpack the string `s` and print its characters separated by spaces.

Given the values of specific indices in the string `s`:
- `s[1]` is '0'
- `s[29]` is '1'
- `s[30]` is '0'

And knowing that the length of `s` is greater than 30, the string `s` must contain these characters at least up to index 30. Since no other specific values are provided for other indices, we can infer that the rest of the string might contain any characters, but the exact content beyond the specified indices is not necessary for the answer.

Therefore, the output will be the characters from the string `s`, starting from index 1 up to index 30, with a space between each character.

Output: **0 1 0**
