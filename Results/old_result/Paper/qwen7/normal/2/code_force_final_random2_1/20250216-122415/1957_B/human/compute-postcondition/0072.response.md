Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing two elements \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - \text{sum(ans)}\), `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), and the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Given that `ans` initially contains one element \((1 << i) - 1\), the new value appended to `ans` is \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
