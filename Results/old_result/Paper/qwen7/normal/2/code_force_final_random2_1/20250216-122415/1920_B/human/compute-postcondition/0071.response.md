Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` contains `[sums]`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is already defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, it adds this value to the list `ans`. The variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
