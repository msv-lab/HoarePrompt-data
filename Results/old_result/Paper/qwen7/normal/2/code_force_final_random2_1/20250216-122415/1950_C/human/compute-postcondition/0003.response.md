Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

The code splits the input into two integers, `h` and `m`, which are then assigned to the variables `h` and `m`. The values of `t`, `day`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
