Output State: **`max_index` is undefined, `min_index` is the last element in `min_indices`.**

Explanation: The function `func_2(max_index, min_index)` is called with `max_index` and `min_index` as arguments. However, the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet, so no changes are made to the variables within the given context. The `min_index` remains unchanged as it was the last element in `min_indices`, and `max_index` is not initialized or modified before the function call, hence it is undefined.
