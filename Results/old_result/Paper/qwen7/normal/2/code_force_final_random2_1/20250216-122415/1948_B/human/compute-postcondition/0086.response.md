Output State: **`ans` is False, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the current state of `nums` is not sorted. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply exits the context where it was placed, which could be a loop or an if statement. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
