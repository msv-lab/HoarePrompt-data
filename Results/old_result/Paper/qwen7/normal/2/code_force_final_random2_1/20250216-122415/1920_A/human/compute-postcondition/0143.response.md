Output State: **`no` is a list, `num` is 0, `big` is a list containing `a`, `less` is a list containing either `a` (if `x` is 1) or `a` (if `x` is 2), `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `a` is an input integer, the updated state includes `big` now containing `a`.
