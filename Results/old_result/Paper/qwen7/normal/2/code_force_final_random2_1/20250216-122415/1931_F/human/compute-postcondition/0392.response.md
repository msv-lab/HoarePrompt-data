Output State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 1, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx2` is updated to 1 while the other variables retain their initial states.
