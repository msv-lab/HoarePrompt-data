Output State: **`k` is an integer; `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`; `ans1` now contains the element `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, the value added to `ans1` is the same as `b[i - 1]`. The values of `k` and the relationship between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
