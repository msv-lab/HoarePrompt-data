Output State: **`h` is 0 + `n // i`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is updated by adding the value of `curr`, which is `n // i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
