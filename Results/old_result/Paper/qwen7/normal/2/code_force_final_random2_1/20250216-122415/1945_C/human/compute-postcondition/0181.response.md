Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, starting from 0.
   - `n-1` is the upper limit of the loop, meaning the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n-2`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n-1`.
   - Given that `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `n-1` is at least 1 (i.e., `n` is at least 2).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n-1` being at least 1, `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` will start at 0.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` should be set to 0.

The final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
**`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0**.

So, the answer is:
**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0**.
