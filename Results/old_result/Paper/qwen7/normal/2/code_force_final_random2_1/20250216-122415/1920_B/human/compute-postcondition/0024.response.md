Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was previously equal to `sums`, after appending, `ans` becomes a list containing that single value. The values of `i`, `k`, and `sums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
