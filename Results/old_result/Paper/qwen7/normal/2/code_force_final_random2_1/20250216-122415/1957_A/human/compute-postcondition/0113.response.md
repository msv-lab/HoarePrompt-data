Output State: **`palka` has at least one element, `d` is a dictionary, and the value associated with key `i` in `d` is 1.**

The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The precondition that `palka` must have at least one element remains unchanged, and the value associated with key `i` in `d` changes from `None` to `1`.
