Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`, no changes were made to the variables by the `sys.stdout.flush()` command.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console immediately. However, this command does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `mak`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `pans` remain unchanged.
