Postcondition: `val` must contain at least one tuple. `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that excludes `a3` from `l`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to such a list comprehension, the program does not perform any additional operations related to breaking out of loops or if statements.
