Output State: **`i` is `bets`, `ans` is the value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[bets]` followed by a space**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the string representation of `a[bets]` (where `bets` is the current value of `i`) followed by a space. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially `bets`. Therefore, `i` is still `bets`, and `ans` now includes the string representation of `a[bets]` appended to its previous value, followed by a space.
