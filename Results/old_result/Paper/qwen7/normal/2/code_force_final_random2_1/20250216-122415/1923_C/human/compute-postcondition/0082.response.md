Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer decreased by 1.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `s` is equal to the value of `p[b - 1]` decreased by the value of `p[a - 2]`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 1.
- Either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1 or `s` is less than `2 * (b - a + 1)`.

The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given this, the print statement will simply output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
