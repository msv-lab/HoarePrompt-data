Output State: **`i` is `bets`; `ans` is the value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[bets]` followed by a space**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the variable `ans` by appending the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is currently `bets`) followed by a space. The variable `i` remains unchanged with its current value `bets`.
