Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `h`. The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 0.
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive.
   - `h` is 1.
   - `li` is a list containing the value `a + 0 * c + 1 * d`, which simplifies to `a + d`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `h < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `h` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `h` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop but not a variable that changes within the loop.
   - The list `li` does not change within the loop based on the given information.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `h` to 2.

**State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 2, `li` is a list containing the value `a + d`**.
