Output State: **`max_profit` is 0, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `profit_next` by calling the function `func_1` with `mid + 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` as arguments. The values of `max_profit`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `profit_mid` remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
