Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Triangle Identification**: The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes it's a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to determine a triangle because a triangle can span multiple rows, and not every row can have exactly one '1'.

2. **Square Identification**: The program checks if every row contains more than one '1'. If so, it assumes it's a square. This is also not sufficient because a square can be misidentified if the '1's are not evenly spaced.

To correctly identify the shapes, we need to:
- Check for the pattern of '1's in the rows and columns to confirm the shape.
- Ensure that the '1's follow the specific patterns of a triangle or a square.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = []
        for _ in range(n):
            grid.append(list(map(int, input().strip())))
        
        # Function to check if the grid forms a triangle
        def is_triangle():
            for i in range(n):
                ones = [j for j in range(n) if grid[i][j] == 1]
                if len(ones) == 1:
                    col = ones[0]
                    for k in range(i + 1, n):
                        if sum(grid[k][col - (k - i):col + (k - i) + 1]) != 2 * (k - i + 1) - 1:
                            return False
                    return True
            return False
        
        # Function to check if the grid forms a square
        def is_square():
            for i in range(n):
                ones = [j for j in range(n) if grid[i][j] == 1]
                if len(ones) > 1:
                    k = min(ones) + 1
                    for j in range(k, n):
                        if sum(grid[i][j - k:j + k]) != 2 * k - 1:
                            return False
                    return True
            return False
        
        if is_triangle():
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif is_square():
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")

func()
```

This corrected version checks for the specific patterns required to identify a triangle or a square accurately.
