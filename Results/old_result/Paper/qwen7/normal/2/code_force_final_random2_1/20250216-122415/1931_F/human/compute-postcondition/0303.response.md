Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input using `input()`. The `map(int, ...)` function converts each element in the split string into an integer. The first integer is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are collected into a list `l3`. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
