Output State: **`tree` contains all the edges of the tree in the order they were added, `start` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `start = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `start`. The deque `tree` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, the state of `tree` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
