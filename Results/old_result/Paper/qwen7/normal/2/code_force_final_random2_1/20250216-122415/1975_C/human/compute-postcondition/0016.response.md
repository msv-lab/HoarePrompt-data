Output State: **`i` is 3; `max` is the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`; `n` must be the same as before.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `max` to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `max` is now the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as per the initial state.
