You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` and another integer `n`, followed by `2n` integers representing numbers on a whiteboard. It then sorts these numbers in ascending order and calculates the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs from the sorted list. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`numCases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`numInteger`) and the list of integers (`numbers`).

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`.

3. **Scoring Mechanism:**
   - A loop runs until the list of numbers is empty.
   - In each iteration, the smallest two numbers are popped from the list, their minimum is added to the score (`suma`), and they are removed from the list.

4. **Output:**
   - The total score (`suma`) is printed for each test case.

### Reasoning

#### Correctness of Sorting:
- Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are processed first, which is crucial for maximizing the score because we always want to pair the smallest available numbers to minimize the subtraction.

#### Popping Elements:
- The program correctly pops the first two elements from the sorted list in each iteration, ensuring that the smallest elements are paired together.

#### Calculation of Score:
- By always pairing the smallest available numbers, the program ensures that the sum of the minimums is maximized.

#### Handling All Test Cases:
- The program processes all test cases as specified, reading the number of test cases and handling each one individually.

### Example Walkthrough

Given the example provided in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1`, `2 3`
   - Sorted list: `[2, 3]`
   - First iteration: `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `suma = 2`
   - Output: `2`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2`, `1 1 2 1`
   - Sorted list: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
   - First iteration: `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `suma = 1`
   - Second iteration: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `suma = 2`
   - Output: `2`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Sorted list: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Iterations: `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `suma = 1` (repeated 3 times)
   - Output: `3`

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. It handles all test cases as specified and produces the correct output.
