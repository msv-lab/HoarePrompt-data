Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks and then reads a list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Data Structure Initialization:**
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is initialized to store unique stick lengths.

3. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program iterates over the stick lengths in `palka`.
   - For each stick length, it updates the count in the dictionary `d` and adds the length to the list `pl` if it hasn't been added before.

4. **Calculating Maximum Polygons:**
   - The program initializes a counter `shapes` to zero.
   - It then iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length, if the count in `d` is at least 3, it increments the `shapes` counter.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `shapes` for each test case.

### Correctness Check

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1`, `1`, `1`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Only one stick, so no polygon can be formed.
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2`, `1`, `1`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Two sticks, but not enough to form a polygon.
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `6`, `2`, `2`, `3`, `3`, `3`, `3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Four sticks of length 3 can form one square.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `9`, `4`, `2`, `2`, `2`, `2`, `4`, `2`, `4`, `4`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Eight sticks of length 2 can form two pentagons (each side 2), and four sticks of length 4 can form one square.
   - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided examples, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks.

**Correctness: **True**
