### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.
   - If `m == 1`, it prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Screenshot Comparison:**
   - The function reads the first two screenshots and compares the lists `l1` and `l2` after removing the author from each list.
   - If these lists are not equal, it prints 'no' and skips further checks. This part is correct.

3. **Index Calculation and List Insertion:**
   - The function calculates indices `idx1` and `idx2` where the author of the second screenshot appears in the first list and vice versa.
   - Based on these indices, it decides which list to modify and inserts the author at the calculated index.
   - The logic for calculating `idx1` and `idx2` is flawed. It assumes that the indices will always be found in a straightforward manner, which may not be true. Specifically, the function does not handle cases where the author of the second screenshot might appear multiple times in the first list, or where the author of the first screenshot might appear multiple times in the second list.

4. **Handling Multiple Screenshots:**
   - The function iterates over the remaining screenshots and checks if they match the modified list after removing the author.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints 'no'.
   - If all screenshots match, it prints 'yes'.
   - The handling of multiple screenshots is also problematic. The function assumes that the order of insertions is fixed, which is not necessarily true. The function should check if the modified list can be transformed into the original list through a series of insertions, not just a fixed sequence of insertions.

### Issues Identified:
- **Index Handling:** The logic for calculating `idx1` and `idx2` is flawed. It assumes that the indices will always be found in a straightforward manner, which may not be true.
- **List Modification:** The insertion logic is overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.
- **Edge Cases:** The function does not handle all possible edge cases, such as when the lists are already sorted or when the indices are not found.
- **General Logic:** The function assumes a fixed sequence of insertions, which is not necessarily correct. The function should check if the modified list can be transformed into the original list through a series of insertions, not just a fixed sequence of insertions.

### Correctness:
Given the identified issues, the function does not handle all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
