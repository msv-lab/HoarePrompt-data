Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of list `l`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was (assuming it was initially set to `i`, which is 2) to `k-1`. However, since `k` was not explicitly defined before the operation and no other changes were made to `ans1` or `ans2`, their values remain unchanged. The only updated variable is `i`, which is now 1.
