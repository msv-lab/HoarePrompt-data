Output State: **`x` is `y + 1`, `x` must be less than `n`, `l[x]` is equal to `b`, `l[x]` is greater than `b` is no longer valid**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of `l[x]`. Since `l[x]` was previously less than `a` and greater than `b`, after the assignment, `l[x]` is now equal to `b`. The condition that `l[x]` is greater than `b` is no longer valid because `l[x]` is now equal to `b`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
