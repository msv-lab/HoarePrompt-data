Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` generates a string `s` by repeating the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` exactly `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to construct the shortest string `s` that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. One efficient way to do this is to use the de Bruijn sequence concept, but for simplicity, we can generate the required string by ensuring that each character appears in a way that all combinations are covered.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import collections
from collections import Counter
from collections import defaultdict
import math
from math import log

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    # Generate the lexicographically smallest string that contains all subsequences of length n
    s = ""
    for char in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"[:k]:
        s += char * (n // k + (1 if len(s) < n else 0))
    print(s)
```

This program ensures that the generated string `s` is the lexicographically smallest and contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
