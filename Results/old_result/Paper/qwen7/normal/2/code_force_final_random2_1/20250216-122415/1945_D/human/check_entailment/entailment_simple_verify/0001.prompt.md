You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. We need to consider the costs associated with swapping positions with people in front of him.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Costs**: 
   - Swapping with the person at position `j` (where `j < i`) costs `a_j`.
   - For each person between `j` and `i`, it costs `b_k`.

2. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost while ensuring Kirill ends up in one of the first `m` positions.

### Given Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1()`

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - Reads lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` and reverses them.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Iterates from `0` to `n - k - 1`:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it updates `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - Iterates from `n - k` to `n - 1`:
     - Updates the result with the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
     - Adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.

5. **Output**:
   - Prints the minimum cost.

#### Function `func_2()`

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.

2. **Loop Over Test Cases**:
   - Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Correctness Check

1. **Reversing Lists**:
   - Reversing the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` is unnecessary because the problem does not specify any specific order for processing elements.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic for updating `pref` and `soma_b` seems to be incorrect. It should consider the cumulative cost of swaps and the cost of moving Kirill to the desired position.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The result calculation part seems to be missing the cumulative cost of swaps correctly.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain a cumulative cost of swaps and ensure we update the minimum cost appropriately.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the cost array
    cost = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        cost[i] = cost[i + 1] + lista_B[i]
    
    # Initialize the minimum cost
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost
    for i in range(n - k + 1, n + 1):
        current_cost = cost[i] + min(cost[j] + lista_A[j] for j in range(i - k, i))
        min_cost = min(min_cost, current_cost)
    
    print(min_cost)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Call the main function
func_2()
```

### Conclusion

The given program has logical errors and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
