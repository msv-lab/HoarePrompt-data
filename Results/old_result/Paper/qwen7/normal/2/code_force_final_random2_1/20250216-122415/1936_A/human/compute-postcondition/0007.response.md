Output State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, the input received is less than 0**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 and the fact that the input received is less than 0 are still valid preconditions.
