Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`; `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`; `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`; `_` is still 0; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `s` is the input string; `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`; `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`; `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution; `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `lst` must not be empty, and there exists at least one `elem` in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; `final` contains one additional element `elem` where |`pk` - `elem`| = `mini`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `lst` must not be empty, and there exists at least one `elem` in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; `final` contains three additional elements where one is `elem` and the other two are also elements in `lst` such that their absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `lst` must not be empty, and there exists at least one `elem` in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; `final` now contains at least one element which is equal to `elem`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
