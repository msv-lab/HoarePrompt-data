Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in the provided function does not align with the rules of the game. Specifically, the function attempts to count the number of cards that appear exactly once or twice (which would be `// 3`), but this is not relevant to the game's scoring mechanism.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The function does not implement the optimal strategy for maximizing the score. Given that Nene always tries to maximize her score while minimizing yours, the function should simulate the game and account for Nene's optimal moves.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: The current implementation counts occurrences of each element in the list and divides by 3, which is irrelevant to the game's scoring. This does not reflect the strategic decision-making required by the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. Hereâ€™s a conceptual approach:

- Simulate the game turn-by-turn.
- For each of your moves, calculate the best possible outcome considering Nene's optimal responses.
- Keep track of the points scored by both players.

This requires a more complex algorithm, likely involving dynamic programming or a similar strategy to account for the optimal moves of both players.
