Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`; `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns; `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun; `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price; `low` is 0; `high` is `mid` - 1; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is less than or equal to `profit_mid`.**

Explanation: The variable `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The values of `low`, `mid`, and `profit_mid` are still valid and unchanged from their previous states.
