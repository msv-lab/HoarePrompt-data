To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

Given the current state:
- `x` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 4
- `m` is greater than or equal to 6
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is 1

Let's evaluate the loop conditions with these values:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting the values: `(2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
   - Since `n` is greater than or equal to 4, this condition can be satisfied.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting the values: `(2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
   - Since `m` is greater than or equal to 6, this condition can be satisfied.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must still be true after the next iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that:
- `(x + y) * x <= n` remains true
- `(x + y) * y <= m` remains true

Since `x` and `y` are constants (2), the expressions `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` will always evaluate to 8. Thus, the conditions depend on `n` and `m` remaining such that they are greater than or equal to 8 and 8 respectively.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 8
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 8

State: **`x` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 8, `m` must be greater than or equal to 8, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 1**
