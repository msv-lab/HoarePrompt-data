Postcondition: `no` must contain at least one element; `i` is the next element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum of the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum of the `big` list, then `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1. If the condition is not met, `num` remains unchanged.
