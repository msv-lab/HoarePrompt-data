Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `a`. Given the postcondition, we know that `a` must have at least one element at the start of each iteration.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop condition is based on the presence of elements in `a`, `a` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - The variable `j` represents the current element being processed in the loop. However, since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to adjust `j` explicitly. Instead, we focus on ensuring `a` has at least one element.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `a` still has at least one element, and the conditions regarding `l` and `h` (which were updated within the loop body) remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

**State: **`a` must have at least one element, `l` is increased by 1 if `j` equals 'A', and `h` is increased by 1 if `j` does not equal 'A'**
