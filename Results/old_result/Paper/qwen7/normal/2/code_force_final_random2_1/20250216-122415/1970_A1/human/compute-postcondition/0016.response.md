Output State: **`balance` is either 2 or 0, `details` is a list containing two tuples \[(2, -1, char), (balance, -1, char)\], `s` must contain at least one character, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character in `s` that is either '(', or a character other than '('**

Explanation:
- Initially, `details` is a list containing one tuple \((balance, -1, char)\).
- After executing `details.append((balance, -i, char))`, the new tuple \((balance, -i, char)\) is added to the list.
- Since `balance` is either 2 or 0, and `i` is 1, the appended tuple is \((balance, -1, char)\).
- Therefore, `details` now contains two tuples: \((2, -1, char)\) and \((balance, -1, char)\).
