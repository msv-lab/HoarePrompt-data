Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is either -1 or within the range [-27, 51]; `arr` is a list containing the elements 26, 26, 1.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. Since `lex` was originally either 0 or within the range [-26, 52], subtracting 1 from it results in a new value that is either -1 or within the range [-27, 51]. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
