Output State: **`ai` is 0, `i` is 2, `op` is `op ^ (val >> 2 & 1)` for each element in `a`, `t` is [], and `val` is the last element in the list `a` which is now an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `a, t = t, []` swaps the values of `a` and `t`. Initially, `t` is a list containing all unique values of `ai ^ val` for each iteration where `op` was False, and `val` is the last element in the list `a`. After the swap, `t` becomes an empty list, and `a` retains its previous state, which is the list `t` before the swap. The other variables (`ai`, `i`, and `op`) remain unchanged.
