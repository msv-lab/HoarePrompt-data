Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains [26], `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` was an empty list. After appending `26`, `arr` now contains `[26]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
