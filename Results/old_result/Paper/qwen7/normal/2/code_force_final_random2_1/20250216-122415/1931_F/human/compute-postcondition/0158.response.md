Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `a3` and `l3`, which are extracted from the tuples in the list `val`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are tuples in the list `val` from which `a3` and `l3` can be extracted.

3. **Determine the state changes**: At the end of the previous iteration, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the same tuple. The loop will continue if `l3` is equal to a list comprehension that excludes `a3` from `l`.

4. **Check the postcondition**: The postcondition states that `val` must contain at least one tuple. Since we are moving to the next iteration, `val` still contains at least one tuple.

5. **Adjust the states**: For the loop to execute one more time, `a3` will be the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` will be the second element of that tuple. The list `val` remains unchanged as it still contains at least one tuple.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `val` still contains at least one tuple.
- `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`.
- `l3` is the second element of that tuple.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`val` must contain at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of that tuple.**
