Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree is represented by a deque `tree` with `v` appended to it. Additionally, `u` is not equal to `tree[0]`, `u` is equal to `tree[-1]`, and the deque `tree` now contains `v`.**

This means that the deque `tree` has been updated to include the value `v` at the end, while all other conditions and values remain unchanged.
