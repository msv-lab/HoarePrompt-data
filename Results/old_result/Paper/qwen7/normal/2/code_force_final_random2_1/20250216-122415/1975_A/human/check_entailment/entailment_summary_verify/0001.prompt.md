You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of the list), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. For each test case, it checks if the list \( a \) is non-decreasing. If the list is non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if the list can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing. If such a split exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variable \( t \) is set to 0, indicating the end of processing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Checking if Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The program checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position where the sequence breaks (`a[i-1] > a[i]`).
   - It then splits the array into two parts: `x` (the prefix ending at `i-1`) and `y` (the suffix starting from `i`).
   - It checks if the entire array can be made non-decreasing by ensuring:
     - All elements in `x` are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `y` (`check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`).
     - The array `y` itself is sorted in non-decreasing order (`new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'.
   - If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is correct.
- The program handles all edge cases properly, such as when the array is already sorted or when no valid split exists.
- The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
