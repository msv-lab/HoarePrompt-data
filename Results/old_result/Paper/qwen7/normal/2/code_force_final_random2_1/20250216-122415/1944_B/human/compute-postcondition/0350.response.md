Output State: **`k` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `len(l)` must be at least `n`, `ans2` contains the element `l[i]`, `ans1` contains the element `l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans2`. Since `ans1` was already containing the element `l[i]` before this line of code, it remains unchanged. The values of `k` and `i` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
