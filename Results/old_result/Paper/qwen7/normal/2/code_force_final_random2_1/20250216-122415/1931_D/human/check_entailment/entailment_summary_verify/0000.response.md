### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`.
   - For each test case in `test_cases`, it processes the array `a` and counts the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
   - The logic for calculating `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is incorrect. Instead of finding the required modular values, it should directly check the conditions \(a_i + a_j \mod x = 0\) and \(a_i - a_j \mod y = 0\).

2. **Modular Operations**:
   - The current implementation uses modulo operations to find the required modular values, which is not appropriate. For example, `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` is not necessary and leads to incorrect results.
   - The correct approach would be to directly check if there exists another index `j` such that \(a_i + a_j \mod x = 0\) and \(a_i - a_j \mod y = 0\).

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program increments `beautiful_count` based on the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs, but it does not correctly check the conditions for beautiful pairs.
   - The correct approach would involve iterating through the array and checking the conditions for each pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) directly.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs, we need to:
1. Iterate through the array and for each element `a_i`, find another element `a_j` such that:
   - \(a_i + a_j \mod x = 0\)
   - \(a_i - a_j \mod y = 0\)
2. Count the number of such pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if (a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0 and (a[i] - a[j]) % y == 0:
                    beautiful_count += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

This corrected version directly checks the conditions for each pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) and counts the beautiful pairs.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
