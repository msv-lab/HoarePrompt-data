Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers \((u, v)\), `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v, u]` and `nodes[v]` contains the value `[u]`.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[u]` contained `[v]` and `nodes[v]` contained `[u]`. After executing the code, `nodes[v]` will contain `[u, u]` because the value of `u` is appended to the existing list. All other variables remain unchanged.
