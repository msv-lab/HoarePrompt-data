Postcondition: `x` is 2, `y` is 3, and both must ensure that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is set to 1. If the gcd of `x` and `y` is not 1, no changes are made to `cnt`, and the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` must still be satisfied.
