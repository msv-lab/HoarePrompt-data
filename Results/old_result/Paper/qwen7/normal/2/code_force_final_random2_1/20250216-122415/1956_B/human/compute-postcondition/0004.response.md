Output State: **`elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string stored in `line`, and `line` is the fourth line in the original list.**

Explanation: The code `elements = line.split()` splits the string stored in `line` into a list of strings based on whitespace. Since `line` is specified to be the fourth line in the original list, the value of `line` remains unchanged, and `elements` now holds the list of strings resulting from the split operation.
