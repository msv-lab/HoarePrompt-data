Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop iterates over a sequence of tuples `(n, m, k, a, b)` from the list `cases`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables:**
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `(n, m, k)` and two lists `a` and `b`.

3. **Analyze the conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute if there are tuples in the `cases` list.
   - Each tuple in `cases` must contain valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b` must be defined.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - Since the loop will execute based on the tuples in `cases`, we need to ensure that `cases` is not empty.
   - We also need to ensure that the first tuple in `cases` has valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, and that the lists `a` and `b` are defined.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `cases` must contain at least one tuple.
- The first tuple in `cases` must have valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k` (i.e., \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot \min(n, m)\)).
- The lists `a` and `b` corresponding to the first tuple must be defined.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, the first tuple in `cases` has valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b` corresponding to the first tuple are defined.**
