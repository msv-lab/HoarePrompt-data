Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `dp[4]` is -float('inf'), `dp[3]` is the maximum of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` plus 1 (if `path[4] != '*'`), `dp[3]` remains unchanged, `dp[2]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code sets `dp[i]` to `-float('inf')`. Since `i` is 4, `dp[4]` is now `-float('inf')`. The conditions for `dp[4]` when `path[4] == '*'` and when `path[4] != '*'` remain unchanged because they depend on the value of `path[4]`, which is not altered by this code. Therefore, `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` remain as they were before.
