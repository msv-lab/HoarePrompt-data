Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n - k` is a positive integer, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is updated by adding `lista_A[i]` to its current value.**

Explanation: The line `soma_b = 0` sets `soma_b` to 0, overriding its previous value which was the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i`. The other variables (`i`, `n - k`, and `pref`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.
