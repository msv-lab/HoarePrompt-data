Output State: **`op` is 0, `ma` is `num2` // 2, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, and `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num2` divided by 2 (integer division) to `ma`. This changes the value of `ma` but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `ma` while keeping the rest of the variables unchanged.
