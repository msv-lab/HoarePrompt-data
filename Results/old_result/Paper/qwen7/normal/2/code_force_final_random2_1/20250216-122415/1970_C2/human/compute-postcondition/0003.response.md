Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `nodes` with default values as empty lists. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `start`, or `empty`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
