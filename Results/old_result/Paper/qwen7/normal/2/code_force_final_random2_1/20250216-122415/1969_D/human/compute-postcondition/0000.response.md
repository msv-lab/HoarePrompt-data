Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains two elements: the first element is the value of `n` and the second element is the value of `k` for each test case; `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `prices` and `bonuses` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.**

Explanation: The code `test_cases = func_1()` calls a function `func_1()`, which presumably processes the test cases and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and is not modified by the given code snippet. The lists `prices` and `bonuses` also remain unchanged since they are not involved in the operation of the given line of code.
