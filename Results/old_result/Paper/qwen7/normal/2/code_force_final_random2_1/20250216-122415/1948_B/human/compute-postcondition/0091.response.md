Postcondition: `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is less than or equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. If `nums` is sorted, `ans` remains unchanged.
