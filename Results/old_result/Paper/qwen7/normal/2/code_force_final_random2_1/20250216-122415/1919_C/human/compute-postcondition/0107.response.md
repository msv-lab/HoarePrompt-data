Output State: **`y` is 3, `b` is the element at index 3 of list `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `y` and `b`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged.
