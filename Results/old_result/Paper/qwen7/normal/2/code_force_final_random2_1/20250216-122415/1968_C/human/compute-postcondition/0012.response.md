Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `a` contains three elements where `a[0]` is `a[0] - T[0]`, `a[1]` is `a[0] - T[0] - T[1]`, and `a[2]` is `a[1] - T[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`. The new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[2]`, and the value of `a[2]` is `a[1] - T[1]`. So, the new element appended to `a` is `(a[0] - T[0] - T[1]) - T[1]`, which simplifies to `a[0] - T[0] - 2 * T[1]`. Thus, the updated list `a` now contains three elements as specified.
