Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `l1` is updated with the split input values.
   - `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1.
   - `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`.
   - `arr` is a list with length `n`.
   - `ans` is a list containing two elements \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - \text{sum(ans)}\).
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).
   - The input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer, and `k` is an integer.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the values of the elements in `ans`:
- The first element of `ans` is \((1 << i) - 1\).
  - If `i` is 0, then \((1 << 0) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\).
  - If `i` is 1, then \((1 << 1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\).

- The second element of `ans` is \(k - \text{sum(ans)}\):
  - If the first element of `ans` is 0, then the second element is \(k - 0 = k\).
  - If the first element of `ans` is 1, then the second element is \(k - 1\).

Since `k` is an integer, let's denote it as `k`.

Therefore, the list `ans` will have two elements:
- If `i` is 0, `ans` will be `[0, k]`.
- If `i` is 1, `ans` will be `[1, k - 1]`.

The `print(*ans)` statement will unpack and print these elements separated by spaces.

Output: **[0 k] or [1 k-1]** (where `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`)
