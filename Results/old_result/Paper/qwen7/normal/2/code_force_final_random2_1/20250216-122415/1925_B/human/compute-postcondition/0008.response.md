Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, `n` is greater than `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
