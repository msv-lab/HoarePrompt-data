Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 30, `n` is 29, `s` is an empty list, `s[1]` is undefined, `s[29]` is undefined, `s[30]` is undefined, the length of the string `s` is 0, `nalla` is 31, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `s = []` changes the value of `s` from a string containing specific characters to an empty list. All the elements of the original string `s` (specifically `s[1]`, `s[29]`, and `s[30]`) are no longer defined since they belong to the string context before. The length of the string `s` is now 0 because it is an empty list.
