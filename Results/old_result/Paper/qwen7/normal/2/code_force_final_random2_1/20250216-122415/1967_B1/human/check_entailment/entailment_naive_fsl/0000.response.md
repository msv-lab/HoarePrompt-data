Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates `ans` as `n` and then adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. This calculation does not accurately reflect the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To illustrate, consider the test case `n = 10` and `m = 8`:
- The expected output is `14`, but the program's output is incorrect.

Let's manually verify a few pairs that should satisfy the condition:
- For `a = 1` and `b = 1`: `1 + 1 = 2` and `2` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(1, 1) = 1`.
- For `a = 2` and `b = 1`: `2 + 1 = 3` and `3` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(2, 1) = 1`.
- For `a = 2` and `b = 2`: `2 + 2 = 4` and `4` is a multiple of `2 * gcd(2, 2) = 2`.

However, the program's logic does not account for these valid pairs correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
