Output State: **`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 10, `hmp` is {'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 1}**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 11, and `hmp` is {'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 1}. The code updates `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]`. Since `hmp['A']` does not exist in the dictionary, it defaults to 0 (as per the given conditions). Given `m` is not specified, we assume `m` is the value that would make the condition `hmp[i] < m` true, which is 1 in this case. Thus, `ans += 1 - 0 = 1`, making `ans` equal to 11 - 1 = 10. The other variables remain unchanged.
