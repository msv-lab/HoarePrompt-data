Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified criteria. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each case individually.
2. **Character Separation**: For each password, it separates the characters into two lists: one for digits and one for letters.
3. **Sorting**: Both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. **Validation**:
   - It checks if the digits list is in non-decreasing order.
   - It ensures that the last digit is not greater than the first letter (if any).
5. **Reconstruction and Comparison**: It reconstructs the password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters and compares it with the original password. If they match, the password is considered strong.

Given the provided code and the detailed explanation, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required validation logic.

Correctness: **True**
