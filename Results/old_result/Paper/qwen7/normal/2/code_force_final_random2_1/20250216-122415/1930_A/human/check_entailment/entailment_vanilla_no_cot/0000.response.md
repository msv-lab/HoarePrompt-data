Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the score. Specifically, the issue lies in how pairs are chosen and added to the score. The current implementation simply pops the first two elements from the sorted list and adds their minimum value to the score, which does not guarantee the maximum possible score.

To achieve the maximum score, we should always pair the smallest available number with the next smallest number. This ensures that the sum of the minimum values is maximized at each step. However, the current code does not ensure this optimal pairing strategy.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        while numbers:
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts the list of numbers and then iteratively pops the first two elements to form pairs, ensuring that the smallest numbers are paired together, thus maximizing the score.
