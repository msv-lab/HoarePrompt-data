Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(3)`. The variables involved here are `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the given state, `j` is currently set to 3.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for j in range(3)` will execute as long as `j` is less than 3. However, since `j` is already 3, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute**: To make the loop execute, `j` needs to be less than 3. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to a value that is less than 3.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is less than 3. Since `j` is currently 3, we need to change it to a value like 0, 1, or 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 6, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is '', `j` must be less than 3**
