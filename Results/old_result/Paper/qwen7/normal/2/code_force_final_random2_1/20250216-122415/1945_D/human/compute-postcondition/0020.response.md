Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `n - k` is a positive integer, `soma_b` is the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i`, and `pref` is updated if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` when `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `soma_b` by adding the value of `lista_B[i]` to it. Since `i` can be either 1 or 2, `soma_b` now includes the element at index `i` of `lista_B`. The other variables (`n - k`, `soma_b`, and `pref`) are updated as described.
