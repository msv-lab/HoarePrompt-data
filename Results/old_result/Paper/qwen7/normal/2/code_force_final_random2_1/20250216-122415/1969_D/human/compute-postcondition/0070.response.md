Postcondition: `combined` is a list with one less item than before, `item` is the last item (a tuple) that was removed from `combined`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`.
