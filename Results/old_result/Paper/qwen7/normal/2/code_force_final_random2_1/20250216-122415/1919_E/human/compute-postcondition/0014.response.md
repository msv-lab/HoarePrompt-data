Output State: **`index` is 4 + n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( |p_i| \leq n \) and sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` plus the new result, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
