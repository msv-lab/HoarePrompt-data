Output: **! -1**

Explanation:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is 1.
- `k` must be 1.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is the result of `func_2()` plus 1. Since `func_2()` is not defined in the initial state, it remains as `func_2() + 1`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `! -1` followed by a newline character, with `flush=True` ensuring the output is flushed immediately. Therefore, the output is exactly `! -1`.
