Output State: **`zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), `zero` is increased by 1 for each '0' in `s`, and `one` is increased by 1 for each non-'0' character in `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `zero_perc` using the formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. This means that `zero` is the count of '0's encountered so far in the string `s`, and `i` is the index of the current character in the string. The value of `one` is the count of non-'0' characters. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid, but it does not affect the calculation of `zero_perc`. The counts of `zero` and `one` are updated according to the characters in `s`.
