Output State: **`k` is `-4 * (len(l) - 1)`, `ans1` is a list containing the element `b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, and `l` has its last element appended with the first element of `b`, unless `b[0]` is equal to `b[1]`, in which case no changes are made to `l`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[n - 1]` to `ans1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `k` is still `-4 * (len(l) - 1)`, and the conditions for `ans2`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `l` remain the same as described in the initial state.
