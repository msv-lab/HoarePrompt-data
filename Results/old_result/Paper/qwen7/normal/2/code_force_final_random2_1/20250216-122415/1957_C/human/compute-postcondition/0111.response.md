Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `c` is the first integer from the input split by space, `r` is the second integer from the input split by space, and `num` is `c + 2` if `c` equals `r`, or `num + 3` if `c` does not equal `r`.**

Explanation: The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` was initially `c + 1`, so now it becomes `c + 2`. If `c` does not equal `r`, then `num` was initially `num + 2`, so now it becomes `num + 3`. The values of `i`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged.
