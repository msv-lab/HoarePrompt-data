Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(0, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `n`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `k` is 0.
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive.
   - `h` is 3 (or any value from 0 to `n-1`).
   - `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts with `k = 0`.
   - For each iteration, `k` increases by 1.
   - The loop continues as long as `k < n`.

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `k` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, if the loop is to execute one more time, `k` must be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be between 2 and 500 inclusive.
   - `h` will be the last value it was set to, which can be any value from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `li` will still contain `n` elements, starting from `a` and increasing by `d` for each subsequent element.

Given these points, let's update the states accordingly:

- `k` will be 1 because the loop will execute one more time.
- `n` remains the same and must still be between 2 and 500 inclusive.
- `h` will be the last value it was set to, which can be any value from 0 to `n-1`.
- `li` will still contain `n` elements, starting from `a` and increasing by `d` for each subsequent element.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `k` is 1, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 3 (or any value from 0 to `n-1`), `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.**
Code of the loop:
for h in range(0, n):
    li.append(a + k * c + d * h)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `h` is 1, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `k` is 1, `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and `li` has appended the value `a + k * c + d * h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `h` is 2, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `k` is 1, `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * 2`, `a + c + 2d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `li` is a list with one element equal to `a + k * c + 3 * d`, `h` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
