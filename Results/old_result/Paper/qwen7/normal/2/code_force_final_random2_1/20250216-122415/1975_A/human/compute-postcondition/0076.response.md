Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 2, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, `new_all` is calculated as `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]), `new` is equal to `a[2:]`, and in both cases (whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true or not), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
