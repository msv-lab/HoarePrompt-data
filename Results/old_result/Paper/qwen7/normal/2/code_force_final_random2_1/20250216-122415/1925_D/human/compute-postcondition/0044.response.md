Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given `for` loop is `i`, and it ranges from `0` to `t-1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `i < t`.

3. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `sum_f` is equal to the sum of all `f` values entered over all iterations.
   - `j` is `m`.
   - `f` is the last integer from the input in the final iteration.
   - `a` is the first integer from the input in the final iteration.
   - `b` is the second integer from the input in the final iteration.
   - `p` is equal to `p // gcd`.
   - `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `q` is `q // gcd`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < t`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `j` remains the same as it is initialized to `m` and does not change within the loop.
   - `f` is the last integer from the input in the final iteration and does not change within the loop.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same as they are the first and second integers from the input and do not change within the loop.
   - `p` and `q` are updated to `p // gcd` and `q // gcd` respectively and do not change within the loop.
   - `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over all iterations and does not change within the loop.

5. **Final Adjusted States**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `m` remains greater than 0.
   - `t` remains the same.

Given the above points, the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `sum_f` is equal to the sum of all `f` values entered over all iterations; `j` is `m`; `f` is the last integer from the input in the final iteration; `a` is the first integer from the input in the final iteration; `b` is the second integer from the input in the final iteration; `p` is equal to `p // gcd`; `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`; `q` is `q // gcd`; `i` is `i + 1`**
