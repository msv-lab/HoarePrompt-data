### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of columns `n` and the two binary strings representing the grid.
   - However, the function does not handle multiple test cases as indicated by the initial loop in the main program (`for _ in range(int(input()))`).

2. **String Construction**:
   - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string `s` is flawed. The current implementation checks for a specific condition (`a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`) which does not align with the problem statement. The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest path, which should consider the minimum value at each step.

3. **Path Count Calculation**:
   - The variable `t` is incorrectly calculated. The current logic does not account for the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. The problem requires counting all paths that follow the smallest string, not just the last matched segment.

4. **Output**:
   - The current implementation prints `s` and `t` directly without ensuring they are correct according to the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the current implementation, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the provided code is **incorrect**.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
