Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is the exact number of times the loop ran, `a` is the value from the last iteration, `b` is the value from the last iteration, `f` is the value from the last iteration, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered during the loop executions, `j` is `m-1` (the last iteration index), `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` using the value of `n` from the last iteration.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` based on the given formula. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or last iteration states.
