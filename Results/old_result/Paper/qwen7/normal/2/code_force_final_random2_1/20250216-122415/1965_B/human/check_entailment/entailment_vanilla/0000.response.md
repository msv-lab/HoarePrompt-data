Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Sequence:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\) (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^20]`).
   - It finds the index `idx` of the first power of 2 greater than `k`.
   - If `nums[i] > k`, it sets `idx = i - 1` and breaks the loop.
   - This ensures that `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Modifying List:**
   - The program appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - Finally, it removes `1 << idx` from `nums`.

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the modified list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The sequence includes `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Since `nums[idx]` is a power of 2, the sum of any subset of `nums` will either include `k - nums[idx]` or `k + nums[idx] + 1`, making it impossible to form a subsequence that sums exactly to `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
   - The sequence includes all powers of 2 up to `2^20` and additional values like `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1`.
   - By combining these values, it is possible to form subsequences that sum to any value from 1 to `n` except `k`.

3. **Sequence Length:**
   - The maximum length of the sequence is 25 because the initial list `nums` has 21 elements, and we add at most 3 more elements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other values from 1 to `n` to be formed as subsequences.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
