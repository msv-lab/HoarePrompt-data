Output State: **`i` is 4, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), `w` must be greater than 3, and `M` contains the values 2 and 3.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial value of `i` was 3, after executing the code, `i` becomes 4. The values of `q`, `x`, `w`, and `M` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
