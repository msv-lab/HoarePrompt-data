You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the square root of n does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^3. Additionally, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values across all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is greater than the square root of `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for each iteration where the gcd of `x` and `y` is 1, starting from `y = 1` until the condition `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` is met, `y` is the last value of `y` that satisfied the conditions in the inner loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be greater than the square root of `n`. The variable `cnt` will hold the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` such that the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true. The value of `y` will be the last value it took during the last iteration of the inner loop before the conditions were no longer satisfied.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the count of valid pairs (x, y) satisfying the given conditions)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
