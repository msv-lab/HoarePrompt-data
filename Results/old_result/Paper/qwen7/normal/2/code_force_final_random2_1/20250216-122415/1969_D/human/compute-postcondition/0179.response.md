Output State: **`combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order (excluding the last tuple which was popped), `heap` is a list containing the tuple that was popped from `combined`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, and the last tuple from `combined` has been pushed into `heap`.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops the last tuple from the `combined` list and pushes it into the `heap`. All other variables remain unchanged.
