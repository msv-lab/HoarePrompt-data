Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for char in expression:`. The objects involved here are `char`, `expression`, and implicitly `length` (since the length of `expression` determines how many times the loop will run).

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `count` is initially 0.
   - `expression` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - `length` is an integer such that `1 <= length <= 5000`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the `expression` string. This means the loop will continue until `expression` is empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each character in `expression`, `expression` must contain at least one character for the loop to start executing.
   - The variable `char` will take on the value of each character in `expression` during each iteration, starting from the first character.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `expression` contains at least one character and that `char` is set to the first character of `expression` when the loop starts.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`count` is 0, `expression` must be a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in the string `expression`**
