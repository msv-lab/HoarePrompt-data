Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

Input

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be as follows: `c` is equal to `casos - 1`, `casos` retains its initial value (which is a positive integer greater than 0), and `n` retains its last input value. The loop prints patterns based on the value of `n` for each iteration, and these patterns are printed according to the conditions specified in the code. If `n` is outside the specified range (1 to 4), it prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish).
