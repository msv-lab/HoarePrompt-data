Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `tmp` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` plus the last value added to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` increments `tmp` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is not defined in the given context, it is assumed to be the last element of the list `a` (as per typical usage in such scenarios). Therefore, `tmp` is updated to be the sum of all elements in `a` plus the last value added to `tmp`. The initial state of `a` being a non-empty list of integers remains unchanged.
