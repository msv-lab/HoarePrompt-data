Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]` - `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`**

Explanation:
- `i` is set to `n-3`.
- `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`.
- `ol` is set to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is set to `len(suffZero) - 1`, which is `0 - 1 = -1`.
- `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`. Since `suffZero` is `[0]` and `ol` is `totalOne`, `func_1(suffZero, ol)` returns `0` (assuming `func_1` returns the sum of elements in the list, which is `0` here). Thus, `zeroInd` is `2 * 0 = 0`.
- `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Here, `preOne[-1]` is the last element of `preOne`, and `func_1(preOne, 1)` is the sum of elements in `preOne` up to the first element (which is `0`). Assuming `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums, `preOne[-1]` would be the last cumulative sum, and `func_1(preOne, 1)` would be `0`. Thus, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - 0 = 2 * preOne[-1]`.
- `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`, which is `0 - 2 * preOne[-1]`.

Since the exact values of `preOne` and `func_1` are not specified, the final state includes the updated `ans[i]` value.
