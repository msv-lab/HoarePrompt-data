Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2 or 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing one element which is (1 << i) - 1, and `temp` is either 16, 8, or 4.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`. Here, `1 << i` represents a left shift operation, which is equivalent to multiplying `1` by `2` raised to the power of `i`. So, `(1 << i) - 1` is the largest number with `i` bits set to `1`. For `i` being 1, 2, or 3, the values are `1`, `3`, and `7` respectively. Therefore, `ans` will contain one element which is either `0`, `3`, or `7` depending on the value of `i`.
