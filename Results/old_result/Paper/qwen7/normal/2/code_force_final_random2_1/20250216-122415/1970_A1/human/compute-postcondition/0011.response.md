Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `char`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `balance` is either 1 or -1.
   - `details` is a list containing one tuple (`balance`, -`i`, `char`).
   - `s` must contain at least one character.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `char` is the first character in `s` that is either '(', or a character other than '('.

3. **Determine the Next Values for the Loop Head Variables**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and `enumerate` increments `i` by 1 for each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `1`.
   - `char` will be the second character in the string `s`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `balance` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `details` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` changes to 1.
   - `char` changes to the second character in `s`.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`balance` is either 1 or -1, `details` is a list containing one tuple (`balance`, -1, `char`), `s` must contain at least one character, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character in `s` that is either '(', or a character other than '('**.
