Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer converted from input, `m` is an integer converted from input, `ans` is equal to `n` + 1 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16 + (n + 5) // 25 + ... + (n + min(n, m)) // (min(n, m) * min(n, m)), `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2.

This output state represents the final value of `ans` after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop iterates from `b = 2` up to `b = min(n, m)`. For each iteration, the value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it. The loop continues until `b` exceeds `min(n, m)`, at which point `ans` contains the sum of all these additions.
