Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first \( m \) people in the queue.
2. The solution involves two functions:
   - `func_1()`: This function processes a single test case and calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first \( m \) positions.
   - `func_2()`: This function processes multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

3. For each test case in `func_1()`:
   - It reads the number of people \( n \) and the maximum allowable position \( k \).
   - It reads two lists of integers \( A \) and \( B \), which represent the costs associated with moving past certain positions.
   - It reverses both lists \( A \) and \( B \) to facilitate easier access to the last elements.
   - It iterates through the first \( n - k \) elements of the reversed lists to calculate the minimum cost.
   - It then iterates through the remaining elements to find the minimum total cost.

4. The logic in `func_1()` seems to correctly implement the problem's requirements:
   - It reverses the lists to start from the end of the queue.
   - It calculates the cost of moving past each person by comparing the costs in \( A \) and \( B \).
   - It maintains a running sum of the costs in \( B \) and updates the minimum cost accordingly.

5. `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

Given the execution summaries and the logic within the functions, the implementation appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
