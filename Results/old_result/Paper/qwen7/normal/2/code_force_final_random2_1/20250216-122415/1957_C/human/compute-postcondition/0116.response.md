Output State: **`c` and `r` are assigned the values of the integers entered by the user separated by a space, `i` is `k`, `c` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `num` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of `i`, `c`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged from their previous states.
