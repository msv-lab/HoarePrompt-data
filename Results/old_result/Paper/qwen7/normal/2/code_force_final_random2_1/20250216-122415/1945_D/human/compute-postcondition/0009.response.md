Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it takes integers n and m, lists of n integers a and b. It verifies that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns nothing explicitly but performs operations based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function `func_2` handles a series of test cases, each involving specific parameters and constraints. It processes each test case according to the specified rules without returning any value externally.
