Output State: **`m` must be at least 2, `a3` is an integer from input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`)**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple `(a3, l3)`. After executing the code, `val` now contains two tuples: the original tuple and the newly appended tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.
