Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and it represents the number of test cases; `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The code sets `check` to the value of \(2^{31} - 1\), which is 2147483647. This does not affect the value of `times`. Therefore, the output state includes both variables with their respective values.
