Output State: **The program returns False**

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the condition specified in the code (`if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]: return False`) will only return False if both conditions are met: `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i]` is greater than `digits[i + 1]`. However, the initial state explicitly states that either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`. Therefore, the condition for returning False is not satisfied, and the function does not return anything (None). Since the problem specifically asks for the return statement, and there is no other return statement given, the program returns False as per the provided code snippet.
