Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `lst`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must have at least one element.
   - `elem` is the next element in `lst`.
   - `final` now contains the element `elem`.
   - If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change occurs to `final`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `elem` is the next element in `lst`, after processing `elem`, the next element in `lst` becomes the new `elem`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `lst` must still have at least one element.

Given these points, let's construct the state for the next iteration:

- `lst` must have at least one element (since the loop continues if there are elements left).
- `elem` will be the next element in `lst`.
- `final` will remain unchanged unless the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, but since we don't know the exact value of `elem` yet, we keep it as is.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `lst` must have at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `lst`, `final` contains the current value of `elem`.**
