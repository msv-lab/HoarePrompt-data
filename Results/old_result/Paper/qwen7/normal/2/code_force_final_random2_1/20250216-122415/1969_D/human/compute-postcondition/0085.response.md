Output State: **`combined` is an empty list, `max_profit` holds the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop's execution, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `current_profit` is 0, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_2()` calls the function `func_2()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined here, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k`, but we know they are the return values of `func_2()`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
