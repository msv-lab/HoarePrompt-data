You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

    #State: Output State: `i` is 2, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 * (k/2) + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`, and `len(permutation)` is at least `k * (k/2) + 1`.
    #
    #**Explanation:**
    #- The loop iterates `k` times, and for each iteration `i`, it updates the `permutation` list at indices that are multiples of `k + i`.
    #- After `k` iterations, the loop will have filled all necessary indices in the `permutation` list that are multiples of `k`.
    #- The variable `i` will be `k - 1` after the last iteration, but since the loop uses `i` in the range `range(k)`, `i` will be `k - 1` just before the loop exits.
    #- `curr_v` starts at `len(permutation) + 1` and increments by 1 for each assignment made in the inner while loop. Since the loop runs `k` times and each time it makes `n // k` assignments (assuming `n` is large enough), `curr_v` will be `len(permutation) + k * (n // k)`.
    #- Given that `k` is even and the loop runs `k` times, the total number of assignments is `k * (n // k)`, leading to `curr_v` being `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 * (k/2) + 1` if we assume the worst-case scenario where `n` is just enough to fill all required indices.
    #- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `len(permutation)` because the loop exits when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than `len(permutation)`.
    #- `idx_v` remains `len(permutation)` because it is updated to the length of the `permutation` list after each assignment.
    #- `permutation` will have consecutive integers starting from 2 at all indices that are multiples of `k`, and the length of `permutation` will be at least `k * (k/2) + 1` to ensure all necessary indices are filled.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: 2 3 4

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is equal to 0.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be reduced by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0. Since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, once `t` becomes 0, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be equal to 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all potential cases. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  4 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  A valid 2-level permutation of length 4, such as `[1, 2, 3, 4]` or `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.

- Actual Output:
  The program generates a permutation based on the given logic, but it does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. For example, the program might output `[1, 3, 2, 4]`, which does not satisfy the k-level condition since the sums of segments `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` are 4 and 6, respectively, resulting in a difference of 2.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` do not differ by more than 1. One way to achieve this is by carefully arranging the numbers to balance the sums.
