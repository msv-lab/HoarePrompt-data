Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `new` is a list containing elements from `a[1:]`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`, `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]), check_all_new is False or new_all is False, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or the most internal if statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, the values of `i`, `n`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the loop or if statement is exited.
