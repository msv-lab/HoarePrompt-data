Output State: **`ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with an odd length; `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2; `a` is 1; `func_1(ch[:b])` evaluates to True.**

Explanation: The code `a = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `a`. The initial conditions for `ch`, `b`, and the function evaluation remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged conditions along with the new value of `a`.
