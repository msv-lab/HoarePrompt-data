Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `m + 1`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts from `3` and goes up to `m + 1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within this range.

3. **Check the initial state of `i`**:
   - Initially, `i` is `k - 1`.

4. **Check the condition for the loop to start**:
   - The loop will start if `3 <= i <= m + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is initially `k - 1`, we need to ensure that `3 <= k - 1 <= m + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `k - 1` is within the range `[3, m + 1]`.
   - If `k - 1 < 3`, then `k` should be adjusted to be at least 4.
   - If `k - 1 > m + 1`, then `m` should be adjusted to be at least `k - 1 - 3 + 1 = k - 3`.

Given the constraints and the initial values, we need to ensure that the loop can start with `i` being within the specified range.

**Final State**:
- Ensure that `k - 1` is at least 3 and `m` is at least `k - 3`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is `k - 1` (which should be at least 3), `m` is `n - num` (which should be at least `k - 3`)**

To summarize:
State: **`i` is at least 3, `m` is at least `k - 3`**
