Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t, n, q, an array c of length n, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i. It processes each query to determine the sum of elements in the subarray from index l_i to r_i within the array c and returns the results of these queries.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates through each query, calculates the sum of the specified subarray in the array `c`, and then returns these sums. However, since the specific operation (like summing the subarray) is not detailed in the output, we focus on the parameters and their expected usage.
