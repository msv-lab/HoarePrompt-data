Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement this. It attempts to remove characters from `alphabet` but does not properly track subsequences.
   - The variables `s1` and `s2` are not used correctly to build the required subsequences.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if `len(s1) >= n * k`. This condition is not sufficient to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - The approach of removing characters from `alphabet` and then checking if `s2` is a valid sequence is flawed.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The main loop processes each test case and appends results to `OUT`. However, the logic inside the loop is not correctly implemented to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- Check if each generated string is a subsequence of `s`.
- If any string is not found as a subsequence, return `NO` and provide one such string.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from itertools import product

t = int(input())
OUT = []

for _ in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase English alphabets
    possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
    
    found_all = True
    missing_string = None
    
    for string in possible_strings:
        if string not in s:
            found_all = False
            missing_string = string
            break
    
    if found_all:
        OUT.append('YES')
    else:
        OUT.append('NO')
        OUT.append(missing_string)

for result in OUT:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version uses `itertools.product` to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and checks if each string is a subsequence of `s`.
