Output State: **`p1` is either 0 or 1; `p2` is either 0 or 1; `i` is `n-2`; `idx1` is `n-2`; `idx2` is `n-2`; `val` is an empty list; `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `n-2`; `l` is `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` simply assigns the reference of `l2` to the variable `l`. No new objects are created, and no values are changed. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, and the insertion operation on `l2` remain unchanged.
