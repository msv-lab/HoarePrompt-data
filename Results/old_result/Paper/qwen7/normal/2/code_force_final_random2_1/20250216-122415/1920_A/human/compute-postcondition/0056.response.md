Output State: **`no` must contain at least one element; `i` is the next element in the list `no`; `num` is `num - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. Since `i` is the next element in the list `no`, its value remains unchanged. The precondition that `no` must contain at least one element is still valid. Therefore, the updated state includes `num` being reduced by 1.
