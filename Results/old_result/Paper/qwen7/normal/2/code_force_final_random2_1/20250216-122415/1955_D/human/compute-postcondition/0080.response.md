Output State: **`D` is a Counter object counting the elements common to both `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of strings containing the split input from the user, `bb` is a list of strings created from the split input, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of the values in the Counter object `D` and assigns it to the variable `pairs_in_D`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
