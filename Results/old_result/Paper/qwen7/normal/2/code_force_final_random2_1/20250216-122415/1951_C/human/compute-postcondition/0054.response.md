Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is reduced by `s`**.

Explanation: The code `k -= s` subtracts the value of `s` from `k`. The value of `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, so `k` is reduced by this value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
