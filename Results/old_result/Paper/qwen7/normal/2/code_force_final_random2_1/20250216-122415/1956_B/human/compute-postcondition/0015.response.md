Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros, where each index represents an integer from 0 to 10000.
   - `x` is the variable that will take the value of each element in the list `cnt` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `cnt`. Since `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros, it has 10001 elements (from index 0 to index 10000).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute, `cnt` must have at least one element. In this case, `cnt` has 10001 elements, so it definitely has elements.
   - The variable `x` will take the value of each element in `cnt` starting from the first element (index 0) until the last element (index 10000).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `cnt` must be a list of 10001 zeros.
- `x` should start from the first element of `cnt` (index 0).

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros, `x` is 0**.
