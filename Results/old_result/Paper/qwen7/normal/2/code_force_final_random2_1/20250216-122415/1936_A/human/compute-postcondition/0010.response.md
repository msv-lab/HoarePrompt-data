Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - The input received is less than 0

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `mak` remains 1.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - The input received remains less than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the input received is less than 0**
