State: **`t` must be an integer greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder variable) and `t`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
3. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, the input must be a valid integer.
4. Therefore, the state before the loop starts must ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

Thus, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `t` is an integer greater than 0.
