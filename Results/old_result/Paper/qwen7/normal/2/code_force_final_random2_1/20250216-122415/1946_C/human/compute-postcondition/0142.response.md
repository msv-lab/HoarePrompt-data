Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the binary search process will converge such that `L` and `R` will be equal. Given the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop, `L` and `R` both end up being 50001. The variable `numCuts` remains 0 because the condition `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)` was never met throughout the iterations. The variable `i` remains `n-2` as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `x` is set to the final value of `L` (or `R`) which is 50001. The variable `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is not modified by the loop.
