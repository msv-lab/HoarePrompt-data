Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `r` is set to n - 2, `sunks` is set to 2, `a[l]` is set to 0, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. Otherwise, if `a[r]` is exactly `k / 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is exited. If `a[r]` is less than `k / 2`, the loop or if statement is also exited.**
