Postcondition: `no` is a list, `less` is either an empty list or contains the value 2, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 1, then `big` will contain the value `a`. If `x` is not 1, `less` will contain the value 2 if `x` is 2, otherwise `no` will contain the value `a`.
