Output State: `idx1` is either `k+3` or `k+4`, `idx2` is either `k+3` or `k+4`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` is greater than 1.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have reached `n-1`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, and considering it starts from 0 (implied by the range `range(n-1)`), it will run `n-1` times. The conditions inside the loop set `idx1` and `idx2` based on the comparison of elements in `l1` and `l2`. If any mismatch is found where `l1[i + p1]` is `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is `a1`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the current index `i`. Otherwise, one of them is updated with the current index `i` while the other is set to -1 and the corresponding `p1` or `p2` is set to 1. By the end of the loop, `p1` and `p2` will both be 1 because they are reset to 1 when a mismatch is found.
