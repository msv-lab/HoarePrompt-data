Output State: **`y` is 3, `b` is the element at index 3 of list `l`, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code `b = l[y]` assigns the value at index `y` of list `l` to variable `b`. Given that `y` is 3, `b` will be the element at index 3 of list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being greater than 3.
