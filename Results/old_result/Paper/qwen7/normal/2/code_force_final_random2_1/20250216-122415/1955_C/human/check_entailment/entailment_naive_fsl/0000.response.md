Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Specifically, the logic for handling the attacks is flawed. Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the following input:
```
2
4 5
1 2 4 3
4 6
1 2 4 3
```

Expected output:
```
2
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
2
```

The issue lies in the way the program handles the durability reduction and the breaking conditions. For the second test case, the program incorrectly stops after the second attack, missing the third attack which would sink the last ship.

To fix this, the program needs to properly handle the alternating attacks on the first and last ships until all ships are either sunk or no more attacks are possible. The current implementation does not fully account for all possible scenarios, particularly when the durability of the first and last ships are different and the remaining attacks are insufficient to sink both.
