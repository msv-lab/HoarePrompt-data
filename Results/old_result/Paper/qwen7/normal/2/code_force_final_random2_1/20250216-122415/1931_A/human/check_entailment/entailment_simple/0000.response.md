Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded.
2. The main issues are:
   - The program incorrectly handles the decoding process. It attempts to break down the encoded number into parts that correspond to the alphabet positions but does not handle the full range of possible encodings.
   - The program does not ensure that the resulting word is the lexicographically smallest one.
3. The program incorrectly sorts and processes the `lex` values, which do not align with the problem's requirements.
4. The program constructs the word using the sorted array `arr`, which is not the correct approach for finding the lexicographically smallest word.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
