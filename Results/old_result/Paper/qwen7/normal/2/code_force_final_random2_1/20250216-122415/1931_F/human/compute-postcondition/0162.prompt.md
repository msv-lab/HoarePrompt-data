Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `a3` will be the first integer from the final input split, `l3` will be a list containing the remaining integers from the final input split, `val` will be a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`), and `m - 2` will be equal to 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a3` and `l3` will contain the last set of integers entered by the user, as they were split from the input on the last iteration of the loop. The variable `val` will hold a list of all tuples `(a3, l3)` collected during each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `m - 2` times, and we know from the conditions that `m - 2` is initially greater than 0 and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0, `m - 2` will be 0 after the loop completes.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `val` must contain at least one tuple, where `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` except for `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to such a list, then no specific action is taken as there is no else part provided.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `val` must contain at least one tuple. `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that excludes `a3` from `l`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to such a list comprehension, the program does not perform any additional operations related to breaking out of loops or if statements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` must contain at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of that tuple. If `l3` is not equal to a list of elements in `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
