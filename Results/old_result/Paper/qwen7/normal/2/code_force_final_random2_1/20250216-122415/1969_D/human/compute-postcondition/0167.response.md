Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved during any iteration of the loop, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `prices` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

The code `prices = list(func_2())` assigns the list returned by the function `func_2()` to the variable `prices`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
