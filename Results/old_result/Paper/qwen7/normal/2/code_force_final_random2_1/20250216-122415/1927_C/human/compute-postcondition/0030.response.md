Output State: **`only_a` is updated to contain all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` contains all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`; `total_distinct` remains unchanged; `unique_a` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `m` remains unchanged; `k` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `unique_b` remains unchanged; `relevant_a` remains unchanged; `relevant_b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a` updates the set `only_b` to contain all elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
