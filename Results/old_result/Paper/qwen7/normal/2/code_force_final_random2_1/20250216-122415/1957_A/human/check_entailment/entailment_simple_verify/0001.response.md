### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Stick Counting**: For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths into an array `arr`.
3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`.
4. **Polygon Formation**: To form a regular polygon, each side must be equal, and the number of sides must divide the total count of that length without remainder. Since a minimum of 3 sides are required to form a polygon, the function checks if the count of each stick length divided by 4 (since a polygon with 4 sides is a square, the largest common polygon) is non-zero.
5. **Summing Up**: It sums up the integer division of the counts by 4 for all stick lengths to get the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.

However, there is a critical flaw in the reasoning that the function `func_1` uses 4 as the divisor for forming polygons. This is incorrect because the problem does not specify that the polygons must be squares. The problem only states that the polygons must be regular (equal-sided), which means they could be triangles, squares, pentagons, etc. The number of sides of these polygons can vary, but the key point is that each side must be equal and no stick can be reused.

To correctly solve this problem, the function should consider the smallest possible polygon, which is a triangle (3 sides). Therefore, the correct approach would be to check if the count of each stick length divided by 3 is non-zero, and then sum up the integer division of the counts by 3.

### Analysis:

- The current implementation incorrectly assumes that the polygons must be squares.
- The function should use 3 instead of 4 as the divisor to correctly determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem because it incorrectly assumes that the polygons must be squares.

### Correctness:

**False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
