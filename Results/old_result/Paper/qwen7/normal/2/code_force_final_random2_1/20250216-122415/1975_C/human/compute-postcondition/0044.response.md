Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive). This means `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - `i` will start at `n`, but since the loop condition is `range(1, n)`, `i` must be adjusted to start from 1 for the loop to begin.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n`, we need to adjust `i` to start from 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to run at all.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`max` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `t` is `t - 1`, the list `a` is updated with integers inputted by the user**
