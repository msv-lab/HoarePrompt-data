Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, t is the length of test_cases, heap is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, bonuses is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

The code `bonuses = list(func_2())` assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `bonuses`. Since `func_2()` returns multiple values, `bonuses` is now a list containing those values. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
