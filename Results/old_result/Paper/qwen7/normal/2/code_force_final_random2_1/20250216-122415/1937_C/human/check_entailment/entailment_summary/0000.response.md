Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. The key is to leverage the bitwise OR operation to narrow down the potential candidates for the maximum XOR.

2. **Analysis of `func_3`**:
   - The function starts by determining a `max_index` based on the results of comparing the bitwise OR of pairs involving index 0 and other indices.
   - It then constructs a list `min_indices` based on the results of comparing the bitwise OR of pairs involving `max_index` and other indices.
   - Finally, it updates `min_index` based on the values in `min_indices` and calls `func_2` with `max_index` and `min_index`.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: Determine `max_index` by comparing \(p_0 \mid p_i\) for all \(i\). This step ensures that we have a candidate with a high potential for maximizing the XOR.
   - **Step 2**: Construct `min_indices` by comparing \(p_{max_index} \mid p_i\) for all \(i\). This step helps to identify the indices that do not contribute to a higher OR value when paired with `max_index`.
   - **Step 3**: Update `min_index` by comparing \(p_{min_index} \mid p_i\) for all \(i\) in `min_indices`. This step ensures that we have the minimum OR value among the candidates.
   - **Step 4**: The final call to `func_2` with `max_index` and `min_index` outputs the pair of indices that should maximize the XOR.

4. **Verification**:
   - The approach uses a systematic way to reduce the search space by leveraging the properties of the bitwise OR operation.
   - The number of queries used is within the limit of \(3n\), as required by the problem statement.
   - The logic correctly identifies the indices that maximize the XOR value.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_3` correctly implements the strategy to find the indices that maximize the XOR value using the allowed number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
