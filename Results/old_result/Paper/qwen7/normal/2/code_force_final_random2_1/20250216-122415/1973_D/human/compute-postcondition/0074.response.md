Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2()` + 2 and `l` is less than 3.**

Explanation: The code `cnt -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt` by 1. Given that `cnt` was initially 1, after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
