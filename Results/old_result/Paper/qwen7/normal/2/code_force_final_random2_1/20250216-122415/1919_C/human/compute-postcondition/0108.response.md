Postcondition: `y` is 3, `b` is the element at index 3 of list `l`. If the element at index 3 of list `l` (`l[y]`) is greater than the element at index 2 of list `l` (`l[y - 1]`), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part in the code, so no additional changes occur if the condition is not met.
