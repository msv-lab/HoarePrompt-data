Based on the initial state described:

- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, each between 1 and \(10^9\).
- `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for each iteration where the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is found in `freq`.
- `mod_x` is the remainder when the current `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder when the current `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x` is \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1 for each `num` in `a`.

After the loop completes, `beautiful_count` will contain the total count of pairs \((required_mod_x, required_mod_y)\) found in the frequency dictionary `freq`. 

The `print` statement outputs the value of `beautiful_count` with a descriptive message.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: beautiful_count (where beautiful_count is the total count of pairs (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) found in the frequency dictionary freq)**
