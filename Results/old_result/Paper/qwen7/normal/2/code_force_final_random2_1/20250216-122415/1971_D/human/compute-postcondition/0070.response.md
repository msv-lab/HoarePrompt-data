Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `count` is 4, `flag` is True, `j` is 4 and it must be less than `len(s) - 1`, and `len(s)` must be greater than 3**.

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
