Output State: **`new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) filled with zeros, `dp` is defined, `j` is \(k + 1\), and `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD**.

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\). Given the initial conditions, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) filled with zeros, `dp` is defined, and `j` is \(k + 1\). Since `j + 1` was previously checked to be within the bounds of the list, the current operation updates `new_dp[j - 1]` accordingly. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
