Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be a valid integer that can be inputted, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided, the element is a string representation of an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input value to the list `a`. Since `input()` waits for user input, the value of `n` (which must be a valid integer) is converted to a string and appended to the list `a`. The variables `t` and `a` are updated accordingly, while `n` remains as a valid integer that was inputted.
