Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n. The function returns the total number of elements that have been completely consumed (set to 0) during the loop iterations, represented by the variable `sunks`.**
