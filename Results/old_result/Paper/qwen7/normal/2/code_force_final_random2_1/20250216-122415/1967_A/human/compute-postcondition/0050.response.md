Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `ii`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to be sorted.
