Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n - 1):` will execute as long as `1 <= i < n - 1`.
   - This means `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts from 1) and `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i < n - 1` implies `n > 2`).

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `n` is at least 3.
   - The variable `i` will start from 1 and increment by 1 in each iteration, but its exact value is not specified in the loop head. We only need to ensure that the loop can start.

4. **Other variables**:
   - `t`, `q`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `req` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1**
