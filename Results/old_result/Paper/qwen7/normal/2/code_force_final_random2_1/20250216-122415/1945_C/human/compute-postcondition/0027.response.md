Postcondition: `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)). The current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and the current value of `one_perc` is also greater than or equal to 50.
