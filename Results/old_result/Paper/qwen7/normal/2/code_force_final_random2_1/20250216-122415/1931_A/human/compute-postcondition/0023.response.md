Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` in the range `range(2)`. This means `j` will take values from 0 to 1.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `lex` is either less than 27 or within the range [26, 78].
   - `arr` is a list containing the element 26.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 2. Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, it will go through the values 0 and 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than 2. Since `j` is now 1, the loop will execute one more time (when `j` is 1).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `lex` remains unchanged and still needs to be either less than 27 or within the range [26, 78].
   - `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the element 26.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is either less than 27 or within the range [26, 78], and `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.
