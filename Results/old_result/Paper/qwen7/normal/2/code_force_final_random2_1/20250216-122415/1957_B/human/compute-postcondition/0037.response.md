Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2 or 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are (1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1), and 0, and `temp` is either 16, 8, or 4.**

Explanation: The code appends `[0] * (n - len(ans))` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially contains two elements, `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, appending `[0] * (n - len(ans))` means appending `n - 2` zeros to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` now contains three elements: `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
