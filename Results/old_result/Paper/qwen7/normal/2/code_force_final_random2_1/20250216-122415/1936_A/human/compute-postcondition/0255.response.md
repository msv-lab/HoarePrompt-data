Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `mak` is 3.
   - `mak2` is `n-1`.
   - `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine Values**:
   - `pans` is a list with two elements: `[n-2, n-1]`.
   - `mak` is 3, but since `pans` only has two elements, `pans[mak]` would be out of bounds if `n` is not specified. However, since `pans` only has indices 0 and 1, we need to consider the valid indices.
   - `i` is 3, which is also out of bounds for `pans` unless `n` is greater than 3.
   - Given the context, it seems `n` should be at least 4 for `pans` to have valid indices for `mak` and `i`.

Assuming `n` is at least 4:
   - `pans[3]` is out of bounds, so we should consider the valid indices 0 and 1.
   - `pans[0]` is `n-2`.
   - `pans[1]` is `n-1`.

4. **Print Statement Execution**:
   - The print statement will print: `'?'`, followed by the values at `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.
   - Since `mak` and `i` both refer to indices out of bounds, we should consider the valid indices 0 and 1.
   - Therefore, `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` will both be `n-1` because `pans[1]` is `n-1` and `pans[3]` is out of bounds.

So, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? n-1 n-1 n-1 n-1'**
