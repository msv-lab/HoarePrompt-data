Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, t is the length of test_cases, heap is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`**

Explanation: The code `prices = list(func_2())` calls the function `func_2()` and assigns the returned list to the variable `prices`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `t`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
