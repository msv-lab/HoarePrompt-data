Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `b` and the range `2, min(n, m) + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `b`**: The initial value of `b` is given as `min(n, m) + 1`.

3. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `2` to `min(n, m) + 1`.

4. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the range `2` to `min(n, m) + 1` must be valid. This means `min(n, m) + 1` must be greater than or equal to `2`.

5. **Given Constraint**: It is already stated that `min(n, m)` must be at least `2`. Therefore, `min(n, m) + 1` will be at least `3`.

6. **Adjust the States**: Since `b` starts at `min(n, m) + 1`, and `min(n, m)` is at least `2`, `b` will start at at least `3`. The loop will execute if `b` is within the range `[2, min(n, m) + 1]`.

7. **Final State Adjustment**: We need to ensure that `b` is correctly set to `min(n, m) + 1` and that `min(n, m)` is at least `2`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2**
