Postcondition: **`i` is one of the keys in `hmp`, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is `6 + (m - hmp[i])`, `hmp` is {'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 1}, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and if the value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is updated to `6 + (m - hmp[i])`.**
