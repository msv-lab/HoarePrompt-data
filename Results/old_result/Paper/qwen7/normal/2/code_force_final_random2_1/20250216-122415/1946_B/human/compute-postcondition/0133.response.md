Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is ((((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t % MOD) + t % MOD), `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`, `t` is 8 * t % MOD**

Explanation: The code `t *= 2` doubles the value of `t`. Initially, `t` was 4 * t % MOD. After doubling, `t` becomes 8 * t % MOD. All other variables remain unchanged.
