Reasoning:

1. **Functionality Analysis**: 
   - The function `func_1` constructs two new strings, `s1` and `s2`.
   - `s1` is formed by concatenating the original string `s` with itself.
   - `s2` contains each unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet` (each character repeated once).
   - The function then checks if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`. If so, it returns `True`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` and going to the end, and the string `s2`. Otherwise, it returns `False`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` and going to the end, and the string `s2`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program iterates through each test case, calls `func_1`, and appends the result to `OUT`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "NO" followed by a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES".

3. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `s1` is shorter than `n * k` by returning `False` and constructing a string that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.
   - The logic for constructing a string that cannot be a subsequence of `s` when `func_1` returns `False` seems correct. It ensures that the constructed string uses characters that are not present in `s1` after the specified index.

Given the provided annotated program and the explanation, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
