Output State: **`k` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `ans1` is a list that now includes the element `l[i]`, `ans2` is a list that includes the element `l[i]`.**

The code appends `l[i]` to `ans2`. Since `ans1` already includes the element `l[i]`, `ans2` also includes the same element. The values of `k` and the condition of breaking out of the loop or if statement remain unchanged.
