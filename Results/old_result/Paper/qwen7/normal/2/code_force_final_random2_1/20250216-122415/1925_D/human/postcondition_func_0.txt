The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, m, and k, along with m lines of additional data. For each test case, it calculates a mathematical expression involving the sum of f values, the number of pairs of friends, and the given integers n and k. After processing all test cases, it outputs the result of the expression for the last test case, ensuring all intermediate calculations are reduced modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
