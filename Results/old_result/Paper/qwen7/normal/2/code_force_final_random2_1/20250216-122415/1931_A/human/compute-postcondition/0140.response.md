Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is `lex - 1`, `arr` is either [1, 1, 1] or [1, 25, 1] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `arr` changes based on the new value of `lex`: if `lex` was originally 26, it becomes 25, otherwise, `arr` remains [1, 1, 1]. The values of `info` and `i` remain unchanged.
