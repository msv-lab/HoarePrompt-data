Output State: **`index` is 4, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index-1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| â‰¤ `n` and sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The line `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 3, so after executing this line, `index` becomes 4. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, and `results` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them in the given code snippet.
