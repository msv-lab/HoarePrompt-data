Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is the integer part of the input split by ':', `m` is the integer part of the input split by ':'**

The code simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. This changes the value of `day` to `'AM'`, while the other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
