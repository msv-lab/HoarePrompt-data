Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer (appended to the right of `tree`), `v` is an input integer, `tree` is a list or deque with one more element than before, which is the rightmost element of `tree` plus `v`, `empty` is False.**

Explanation: The line `empty = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `empty`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `u`, `v`, or the `tree` list. The precondition remains unchanged except for the new value of `empty`.
