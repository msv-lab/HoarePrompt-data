Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Let's consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  4
  10 12 14 16 8 12 14
  ```

- Expected output:
  ```
  2 4 4 2
  ```

However, running the provided functions with the input will not produce the correct result. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all subarray sums and sorts them. It works correctly in generating the subarray sums.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to remove duplicate subarray sums. However, it does not handle the case where the last element of the sorted list is a duplicate. For the given input, the sorted list of subarray sums would be `[8, 10, 12, 12, 14, 14, 16]`. After removing duplicates, the list becomes `[8, 10, 12, 14, 16]`. The last element `16` is not removed, which means the last subarray sum is not correctly handled.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array from the unique subarray sums. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the last subarray sum is not correctly removed. As a result, the reconstructed array may not be a valid palindrome.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the solution and is irrelevant to the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly recover the palindrome array for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
