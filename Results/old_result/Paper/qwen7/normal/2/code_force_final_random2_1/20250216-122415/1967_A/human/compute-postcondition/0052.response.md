Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `rem` to 0. This does not affect the values of `ii`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `r`. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
