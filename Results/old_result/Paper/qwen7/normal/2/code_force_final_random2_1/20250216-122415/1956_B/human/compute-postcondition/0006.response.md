Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string stored in `line`.
   - `line` is the fourth line in the original list.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The expression `[*open(0)]` reads all lines from standard input (stdin) and converts it into a list.
   - `[2::2]` slices this list starting from the third element (index 2) and takes every second element thereafter.
   - Therefore, the loop iterates over every second line starting from the fourth line in the original list.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `line` is being updated with each iteration.
   - Since the loop starts from the fourth line and takes every second line, the next line in the sequence would be the sixth line.

5. **New State:**
   - `line` will now be the sixth line in the original list.
   - `elements` will be a list of strings obtained by splitting the string stored in this new `line`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string stored in `line`, and `line` is the sixth line in the original list.**
