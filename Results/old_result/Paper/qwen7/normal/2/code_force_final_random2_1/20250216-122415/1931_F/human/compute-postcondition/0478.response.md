Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple unpacking `(a3, l3)` from the list `val`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the list `val` that can be unpacked into `a3` and `l3`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `m` is 3.
   - `val` is a list containing exactly 2 tuples, each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).

4. **Check the Condition for Breaking the Loop**: The loop will break if `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`.

5. **Adjust the State for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `val` contains exactly 2 tuples, and assuming the loop has just completed its first iteration, the next tuple in `val` will be the second tuple.
   - Therefore, `a3` and `l3` will be the values from the second tuple in `val`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `m` remains 3.
- `val` now contains exactly 1 tuple (since one tuple has been processed).
- `a3` and `l3` are the values from the second tuple in the original `val`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` is 3, `val` is a list containing exactly 1 tuple, each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`)**
