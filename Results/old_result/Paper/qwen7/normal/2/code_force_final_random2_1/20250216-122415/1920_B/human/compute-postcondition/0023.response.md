Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `sums` as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. This value is then assigned to `sums`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `sums`, which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
