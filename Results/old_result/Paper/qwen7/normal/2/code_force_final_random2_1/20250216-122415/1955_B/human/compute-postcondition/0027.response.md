Output State: **`li` now contains the element `a + k * c + d * (h_prev + 1)`, `h` is `h_prev + 1`, and `n` is greater than `h_prev + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given that `h` is updated to `h_prev + 1`, the new element added to `li` is `a + k * c + d * (h_prev + 1)`. The other variables `a`, `k`, `c`, `d`, `h`, and `n` retain their original values except that `h` is now `h_prev + 1`, and `n` remains greater than `h_prev + 1`.
