Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `pl`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `pl` using the variable `j`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d[j]` is an integer.
   - `shapes` is either the same as the previous value or increased by 1 if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `j` is the next index in `pl`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the next index in `pl`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 (assuming `pl` is a list of indices).
   - The value of `shapes` will depend on the new value of `d[j]` (if `j` is within the bounds of `d`).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - `shapes` will be updated based on the new value of `d[j]` (if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` will be increased by 1).

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `j` will be the next index in `pl`, which means `j` will be incremented by 1.
- `shapes` will be the same as the previous value unless `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, in which case `shapes` will be increased by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `d[j]` is an integer, `shapes` is either the same as the previous value or increased by 1 if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is the next index in `pl` (i.e., `j + 1`).**
