Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range of 1 to 100, while `n` and `k` are the integers obtained from the input.
