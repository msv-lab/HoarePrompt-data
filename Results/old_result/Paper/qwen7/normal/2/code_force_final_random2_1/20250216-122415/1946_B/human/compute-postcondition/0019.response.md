Postcondition: **`tmp` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its original value plus `x`. `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: If `tmp` is less than 0, it is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` retains its value as the original value of `tmp` plus `x`. Since there is no else part, the only case considered is when `tmp` is less than 0, in which case `tmp` becomes 0, or when `tmp` is not less than 0, in which case `tmp` remains as the original value of `tmp` plus `x`.
