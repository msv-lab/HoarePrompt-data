### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issue with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Formula for `suma` Calculation:**
   - The code attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs using the formula \( x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \).
   - This formula does not correctly capture the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

2. **Manual Verification:**
   - We have manually verified the pairs for the input \( n = 10 \) and \( m = 8 \) and found that there are indeed 14 valid pairs. The code, however, produces a different result.

3. **Detailed Example:**
   - For \( n = 10 \) and \( m = 8 \):
     - Valid pairs are:
       - \((1, 1)\)
       - \((2, 1)\)
       - \((2, 2)\)
       - \((3, 1)\)
       - \((4, 1)\)
       - \((5, 1)\)
       - \((6, 1)\)
       - \((6, 2)\)
       - \((6, 3)\)
       - \((7, 1)\)
       - \((8, 1)\)
       - \((9, 1)\)
       - \((10, 1)\)
       - \((10, 2)\)
     - Total valid pairs: 14

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The nested loops in the commented-out section correctly identify valid pairs, but the actual implementation in the `suma` calculation is flawed.
   - The formula used in `suma` does not account for all valid pairs as it incorrectly assumes a linear relationship between \(a\) and \(b\).

Given these observations, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
