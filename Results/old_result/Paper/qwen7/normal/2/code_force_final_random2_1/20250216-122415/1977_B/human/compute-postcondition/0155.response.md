Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `flag` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is 29
   - `s[1]` is '0'
4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2 and `n` is 29, the condition `i < n` is true, so the loop will execute again.
   - After the loop increments `i` by 1 (since it is a typical increment in a `range` loop), `i` will become 3.
   - The values of `n`, `flag`, and `s[1]` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is 29, and `s[1]` is '0'**
