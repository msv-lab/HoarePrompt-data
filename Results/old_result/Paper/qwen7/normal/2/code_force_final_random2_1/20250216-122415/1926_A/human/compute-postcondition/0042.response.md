Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `a`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition tells us that `j` is a string, and based on the value of `j`, either `l` or `h` is incremented. Specifically:
   - If `j` equals 'A', then `l` is increased by 1.
   - If `j` is not equal to 'A', then `h` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `a` and `j` is a string, the only variable in the loop head that changes is `j`.
   - The variables `l` and `h` are incremented based on the value of `j`, but they are not part of the loop head and thus their values do not need to be adjusted here.

4. **Next iteration requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the next element in the sequence of `a`.
   - Therefore, `j` should be set to the next string in `a`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should include `j` as the next string in `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is the next string in `a`**
