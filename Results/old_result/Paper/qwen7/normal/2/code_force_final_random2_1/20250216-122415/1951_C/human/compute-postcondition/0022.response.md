Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `n`, which was previously defined in the initial state. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now specific input integers.
