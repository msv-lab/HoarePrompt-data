Output State: **`results` is now a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus 1, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 6, `path` is the string from the 6th line of the `data` list, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, `n` is converted to an integer.**

The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 5, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 6. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
