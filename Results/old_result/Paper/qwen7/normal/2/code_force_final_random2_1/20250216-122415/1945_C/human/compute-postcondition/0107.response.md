Postcondition: **`zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), `zero` is increased by 1, `one` is increased by the number of non-'0' characters in `s`, and `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)). Additionally, both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50.**
