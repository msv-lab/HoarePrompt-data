Postcondition: `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is `n-2`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l` is equal to `l1`. Otherwise, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1`, and `l` is `l2`.
