Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a[1:]`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`.

The postcondition states that `(check_all_new and new_all)` is true.

Given this information, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
