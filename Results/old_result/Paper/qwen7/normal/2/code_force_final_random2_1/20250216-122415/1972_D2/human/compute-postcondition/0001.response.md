State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is mentioned as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\). For the loop to execute, `t` must be within this range.
- The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is a common practice when the loop variable is not used inside the loop body. The value of `_` is automatically set to the current iteration index starting from 0.
- Since the loop runs `t` times, the initial value of `_` should be 0, but after the first iteration, it becomes 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and `_` is now 1.
