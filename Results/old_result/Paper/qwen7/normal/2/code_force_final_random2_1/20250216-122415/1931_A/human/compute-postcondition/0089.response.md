Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is between 0 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is a list containing the elements 1, 26, 26, and 1.**

Explanation: The code `lex = lex - 1` decrements the value of `lex` by 1. Since `lex` was originally between 1 and 52 (inclusive), after decrementing, `lex` will now be between 0 and 51 (inclusive). The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
