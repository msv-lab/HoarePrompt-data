Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[0 - 1] - 2 * a[0 + x - 1]`; `ans` contains the value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and the condition `i + x - 1 < n` remain unchanged. The value of `sums` remains the same as well, but now it is stored in `ans`.
