Output State: `lst` is `[n - 1]`, `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - n + 1))`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `lst` will only contain the last element it iterated over, which is `n - 1`. The variable `mini` will be updated in each iteration to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the current element from `lst`. Since the loop iterates over all elements in `lst` and updates `mini` accordingly, after all iterations, `mini` will hold the minimum value among `abs(pk - 3)`, `abs(pk - 5)`, and `abs(pk - (n - 1))`.
