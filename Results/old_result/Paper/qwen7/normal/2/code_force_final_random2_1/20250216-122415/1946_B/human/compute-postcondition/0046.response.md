Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ans` is calculated as \((s + t) \% MOD + t \% MOD\).
   - `i` is equal to `k-1`.
   - `t` is equal to \((2^{(k-1)} \times \text{the initial value of } tmp) \% MOD\).

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `s` and `t` are not explicitly defined, but they are part of the calculation for `ans`.
   - `MOD` is a predefined modulus value.
   - `k` is a predefined integer.
   - `tmp` is the initial value before any operations, which is used to calculate `t`.

3. **Calculation of `t`:**
   - `t` starts at 0 and doubles in each iteration of the loop until it reaches \((2^{(k-1)} \times \text{the initial value of } tmp) \% MOD\).

4. **Final Values:**
   - Since the loop runs `k-1` times, `i` will be `k-1`.
   - `t` will be \((2^{(k-1)} \times \text{the initial value of } tmp) \% MOD\).

5. **Expression for `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated as \((s + t) \% MOD + t \% MOD\).

Given this, the expression simplifies to:
\[ ans = (s + t + t) \% MOD = (s + 2t) \% MOD \]

Since `t` is \((2^{(k-1)} \times \text{the initial value of } tmp) \% MOD\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[ ans = (s + 2 \times (2^{(k-1)} \times \text{the initial value of } tmp) \% MOD) \% MOD \]
\[ ans = (s + 2^{k} \times \text{the initial value of } tmp) \% MOD \]

Therefore, the print statement will output:
\[ ans = (s + 2^{k} \times \text{the initial value of } tmp) \% MOD \]

Output: **(s + 2^k * the initial value of tmp) % MOD**
