### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. If not, we need to print a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Input**: `s` (string), `k` (integer), `n` (integer).
- **Output**: A tuple containing:
  - A boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
  - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` and going to the end.
  - A string `s2` containing each unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet` (each character repeated once).

The function `func_1` does the following:
1. Initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings.
2. Creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
3. Iterates through the string `s` and appends characters to `s1` and `s2` based on whether the character is in `alphabet`.
4. Removes characters from `alphabet` as they are encountered.
5. Calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
6. Returns a tuple with a boolean indicating if `len(s1) >= n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k`, and the string `s2`.

#### Main Program Analysis:
- The main program iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1` and checks its return value.
- If `func_1` returns `False`, it generates a string `be9i` and appends it to `OUT`.
- If `func_1` returns `True`, it appends `'Yes'` to `OUT`.
- Finally, it prints the contents of `OUT`.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**: The function `func_1` does not actually check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. Instead, it constructs `s1` and `s2` in a way that does not guarantee the presence of all possible subsequences.
2. **Generation of Non-Subsequences**: The program attempts to generate a non-subsequence string by finding a character that is not in `s1` and constructing a string of length `n` using that character. However, this approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the generated string is indeed a non-subsequence of `s`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The function `func_1` does not properly handle the generation and checking of all possible subsequences of length `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect based on the analysis.
