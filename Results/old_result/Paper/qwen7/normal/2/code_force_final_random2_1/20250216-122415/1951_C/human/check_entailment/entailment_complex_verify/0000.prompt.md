You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `c` will be the cumulative sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, `s` will be the minimum of `m` and `k` after the last iteration, and `k` will be reduced by `n * s` after the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers n, m, and k, followed by a list of n integers a. It then sorts the list a and calculates a cumulative sum based on specific conditions involving n, m, and k. Finally, it prints the computed cumulative sum for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to minimize the cost by purchasing tickets in a way that does not fully account for the rules described in the problem statement. Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3 2 5
8 6 4
```
According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be:
- On day 1, buy 2 tickets for a total of \(2 \times 8 = 16\). Prices for the next days become [10, 8].
- On day 2, buy 2 tickets for a total of \(2 \times 10 = 20\). Prices for the next day become [14].
- On day 3, buy 1 ticket for a total of \(1 \times 14 = 14\).

The total cost would be \(16 + 20 + 14 = 50\).

However, the provided program calculates the cost as follows:
- On day 1, it buys 2 tickets for a total of \(2 \times 8 = 16\). Remaining tickets to buy: 3.
- On day 2, it buys 2 tickets for a total of \(2 \times 6 = 12\). Remaining tickets to buy: 1.
- On day 3, it buys 1 ticket for a total of \(1 \times 4 = 4\).

The total cost calculated by the program is \(16 + 12 + 4 = 32\), which is incorrect.

This example shows that the program does not correctly handle the logic of buying tickets and adjusting future prices, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
