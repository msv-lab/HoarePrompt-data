Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `cases` determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `cases` is an input integer and \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\).
   - `info` is an empty list.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `cases` must be at least 1 (since the loop runs from 0 to cases-1).
   - The variable `i` should start at 0 for the first iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `cases` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cases` is an input integer and \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `i` is 0**
