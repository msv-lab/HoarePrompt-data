#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and the length of a is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) where \(n\) is the size of the unknown palindrome array a.

    #State: Output State: The variable `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is `len(a) + 1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `a` as they are added to `sm`.
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` remains unchanged as it was set initially to the length of `a` and does not change within the loop. The variable `j` increments by 1 in each iteration but will always be `len(a) + 1` after the loop since the loop condition `j < len(a)` will no longer be satisfied once `j` reaches `len(a)`. The variable `sm` accumulates the sum of all elements in `a` during the loop iterations. The list `cts` contains the cumulative sums at each step, starting from 0 (since `sm` starts at 0) and ending with the total sum of `a`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list 'a' containing integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array. It calculates the cumulative sums of all elements in list 'a' and stores them in a new list 'cts'. After sorting the list 'cts', the function returns the sorted list of cumulative sums.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `cts` and returns a new list `odds` containing unique integers from `cts`. If an integer from `cts` is not already the last element in `odds`, it is appended to `odds`. Any duplicates in `cts` are removed.

    #State: Output State: The list `a` is fully populated with values based on the elements of `odds`. Specifically, for each element `x` in `odds`, the corresponding positions in `a` are updated according to the rules defined in the loop. The variable `prev` holds the last value of `x` from `odds` after the loop completes, and `idx` is decremented until it becomes -1. The list `a` is symmetric around its center because of the way the loop updates its values. All other variables (`odds`, `n`) remain as they were initially, and `idx` is no longer used after the loop.
    #
    #In more detail:
    #- `a` is filled such that for each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`.
    #- Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`.
    #- After processing all elements in `odds`, `prev` will hold the last value of `x` from `odds`, and `idx` will be -1 due to the decrement operation in the loop.
    return a
    #The program returns a list `a` which is symmetric around its center, where each element is calculated based on the corresponding element in `odds`. For each element `x` in `odds`, if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`. The list `a` is fully populated, `prev` holds the last value of `x` from `odds`, and `idx` is -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `odds` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a symmetric list `a` of size `n` where each element is calculated based on the corresponding element in `odds`. If the current index `idx` equals the mirrored index `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to the current element `x` from `odds`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to half the difference between the current element `x` and the previous element `prev`. After processing all elements in `odds`, the list `a` is fully populated, `prev` holds the last value of `x` from `odds`, and `idx` is -1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList is a list of integers representing the complete list of subarray sums of the palindrome array a, and smallList is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a, with the last element of bigList being the same as the last element of smallList.

    #State: Output State: `bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers with its last three elements removed.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, both `bigList` and `smallList` will have had their last two and three elements, respectively, removed. This means that `bigList` will have been shortened by two elements from its original length, and `smallList` will have been shortened by three elements from its original length.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the second last element of the original bigList
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `bigList` and `smallList`. It removes the last two elements from `bigList` and the last three elements from `smallList` if the last elements of both lists are equal. Finally, it returns the second last element of the original `bigList`.
