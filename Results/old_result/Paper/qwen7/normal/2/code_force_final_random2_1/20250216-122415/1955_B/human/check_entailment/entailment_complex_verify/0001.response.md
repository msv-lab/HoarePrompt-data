### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if a given array `l` can form a progressive square with specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. A progressive square is defined such that each element in the square can be represented as `a + k * c + d * h` where `a` is the minimum value in the array, `k` and `h` range from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Step 1**: The function finds the minimum value `a` in the array `l`.
   - **Step 2**: It generates a list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - **Step 3**: Both `l` and `li` are sorted.
   - **Step 4**: The function compares the sorted lists `l` and `li`. If they match, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

3. **Key Points to Validate**:
   - **Minimum Value Calculation**: The function correctly finds the minimum value `a` in the array `l`.
   - **Sequence Generation**: The sequence generation formula `a + k * c + d * h` is correctly implemented.
   - **Sorting and Comparison**: Sorting both lists before comparison ensures that the order of elements does not affect the outcome.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where the input might have duplicate values or specific patterns that could affect the sequence generation and comparison.

4. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The final state after generating and sorting `li` matches the expected behavior.
   - The comparison logic is correct and returns the appropriate result ('yes' or 'no').

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function correctly implements the logic required to determine if the given array can form a progressive square.
   - The sorting step ensures that the comparison is done correctly regardless of the initial order of elements in `l`.
   - The comparison logic is correct and returns the appropriate result ('yes' or 'no').

Given this detailed analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and should work as intended for the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
