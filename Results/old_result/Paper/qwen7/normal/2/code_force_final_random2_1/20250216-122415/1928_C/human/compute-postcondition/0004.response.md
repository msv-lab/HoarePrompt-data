Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n); `M` is a list containing `[w]`; `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `w` is defined as the square root of `q` and is an integer, it remains unchanged. The other variables (`q`, `x`) also remain unchanged. Therefore, `M` now contains `[w]`.
