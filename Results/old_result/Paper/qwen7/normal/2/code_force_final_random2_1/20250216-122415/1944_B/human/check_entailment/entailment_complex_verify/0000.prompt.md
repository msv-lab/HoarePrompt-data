You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    6 2
    
    5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

Output

    2 1
    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n + len(l)`, `k` is equal to `req - 2 * (2n - len(l) - 1)`, `ans1` contains all elements from the original list `l` and all pairs of consecutive identical elements found in the lists `b` and `c`, and `ans2` contains the same elements as `ans1`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the total length of the list `l` plus `n`, indicating that the loop has processed every element in both the list `l` and the original lists `b` and `c`. The variable `k` will be equal to `req` minus twice the number of consecutive pairs found in the lists `b` and `c`, which is `2n - len(l) - 1`. The list `ans1` will contain all elements from the original list `l` and all pairs of consecutive identical elements found in the lists `b` and `c`. Similarly, the list `ans2` will contain the same elements as `ans1` since `ans1` and `ans2` append the same elements from `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 5000), an array \( a \) of length 2\( n \) where each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly twice, and two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 5 × 10^4, 1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ ⌊\( n \)/2⌋). For each test case, it splits the array \( a \) into two halves, sorts them, and then constructs two lists, \( ans1 \) and \( ans2 \), by selecting specific elements from the sorted halves and the original array. Finally, it prints these two lists. The function ensures that \( ans1 \) and \( ans2 \) contain all necessary elements from the original array and the sorted halves, adhering to the constraints on \( k \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` are equal. Here's an example to demonstrate this:

Consider the input:
```
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

The expected output would be two arrays `l` and `r` such that their XOR values are equal. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this. For instance, the program might generate `l` and `r` as follows:
- `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `r = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

This results in:
- XOR of `l`: \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0\)
- XOR of `r`: \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0\)

However, another valid solution could be:
- `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `r = [1, 2, 3, 4]` (same as above, which is fine)
- Or, for example, `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `r = [1, 2, 3, 4]` might not necessarily be the only valid pairs.

But the critical issue is that the program does not ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal. It simply appends elements from `b` and `c` without ensuring the XOR condition. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of finding `l` and `r` such that their XOR values are equal.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
