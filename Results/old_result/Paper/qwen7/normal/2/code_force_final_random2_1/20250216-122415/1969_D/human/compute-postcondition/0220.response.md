Postcondition: **`combined` has at least one element less than before; `heap` now contains the new last element of `combined` which replaced `item`; `current_profit` is reduced by either the first element or the second element of the last element of `combined` before popping, depending on whether the sum of the first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0; `item` is the last element of `combined` before popping; `removed_item` is the last element of `combined` before popping. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is set to `current_profit`.**
