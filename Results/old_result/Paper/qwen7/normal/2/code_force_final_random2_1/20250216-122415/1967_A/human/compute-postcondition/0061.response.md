Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, the first element of `a` is `r`, `rem` is `0 % (0 + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - 0`, `i` is 0, `r` is `a[0] + 0 // (0 + 1)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. All the initial conditions remain unchanged.
