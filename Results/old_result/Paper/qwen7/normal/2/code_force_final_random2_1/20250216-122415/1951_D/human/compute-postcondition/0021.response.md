Output State: **`h` is `n`, `n` is `n - 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`, `curr` is `n // i`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `h` is calculated as `0 + (n - k + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.
- `n` is updated to `n - 1 * curr`, and since `curr` is `1`, `n` becomes `n - 1`.
- `k` remains a positive integer.
- `costs` remains a list containing one element: `1`.
- `curr` is updated to `n // i`. Since `n` was `n - 1` before the operation and `i` is not specified, `curr` becomes `(n - 1) // i`.
