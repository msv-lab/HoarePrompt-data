Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the value of `int(input())`, `x` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0' with an additional '0' appended to it, `length` is 30**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. The values of `i`, `t`, `x`, and `length` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `s` now contains one more element, which is `'0'`.
