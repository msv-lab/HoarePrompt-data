Output State: **`x` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer input by the user, `a` is a list containing three strings representing integers, with each string being the input provided during each iteration of the loop, `s` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `x` to 0. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
