Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is 2
   - `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with elements `k - nums[2]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[2] + 1` appended to it
   - `i` is equal to 21
   - `nums` now does not contain the element `1 << idx` (which is 4)

3. **Determine if the loop can execute again**:
   - The loop will execute again if `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since we don't know the exact value of `int(input())` from the given information, we assume it can still be greater than 0 for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `idx` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `nums` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

5. **Only the loop counter needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop counter `_` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`idx` is 2, `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with elements `k - nums[2]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[2] + 1` appended to it, and `i` is equal to 21**
