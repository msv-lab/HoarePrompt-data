Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree is represented by an empty deque `tree`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `empty`. No other changes are made to the other variables or their conditions. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the assignment to `empty`.
