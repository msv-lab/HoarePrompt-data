Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `r` is now `n-2`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and either `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[r]` and `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, or `k` is 0 or `a[r] * 2 == k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
