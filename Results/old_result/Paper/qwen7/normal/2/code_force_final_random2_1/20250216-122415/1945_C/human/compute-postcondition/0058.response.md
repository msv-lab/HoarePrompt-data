Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `elem` and `lst`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `elem` is a variable used in the loop, but its initial value is not specified directly. It will take values from the list `lst` one by one.
   - `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `lst` is non-empty. If `lst` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `lst` is a list and it determines whether the loop will execute, we need to ensure that `lst` is not empty.
   - The initial state of `mini`, `zero`, `one`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `final`, and `zero_perc`, `one_perc` do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `lst` to ensure it is not empty.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`lst` must not be empty**
