Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to `r`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i + 1]` refers to `a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
