Output State: **`no` is a list, `num` is 0, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise it is an empty list, `less` is a list containing `a`, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `less`. Since `a` is an input integer, `less` now contains `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
