Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(len(b))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `len(b)` must be greater than 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < len(b)`. 

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `i` by 1 means `i` will now be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `len(b)` must still be greater than 0 (since the loop condition is based on the length of `b`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1
- `len(b)` must be greater than 0

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `len(b)` must be greater than 0**
