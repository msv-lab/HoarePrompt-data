Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `n` is an odd number, `pk` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `pk = n // 2` assigns the value of `n // 2` (integer division of `n` by 2) to the variable `pk`. Since `n` is an odd number, `n // 2` will be the largest integer less than or equal to half of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
