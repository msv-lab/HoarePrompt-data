You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates the maximum profit Alice can achieve by combining her prices (a_i) and Bob's prices (b_i) under certain conditions. Specifically, it uses a heap to manage a subset of these prices and iteratively adjusts the profit based on the combined values. After processing all test cases, it prints the highest profit achieved across all cases.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the prices `a_i` and `b_i` for each item.
   
2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A heap is initialized to keep track of the best items to keep.
   - The prices are converted to negative values to use a min-heap as a max-heap.
   - Items are sorted based on their `b_i` value.

3. **Initial Heap Population:**
   - The first `k` items are added to the heap based on their `b_i` value.
   - If there are more than `k` items, the remaining items are processed.

4. **Processing Remaining Items:**
   - For each remaining item, the program checks if adding it to the current profit is beneficial.
   - If the item's `a_i + b_i` is non-negative, it subtracts `b_i` from the current profit.
   - Otherwise, it adds `a_i` to the current profit.
   - The item is then pushed into the heap, and the previously removed item is adjusted in the current profit.

5. **Updating Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is updated whenever a better profit is found.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- **Test Case Handling:** The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
- **Item Selection Logic:** The logic for selecting items and updating profits aligns with the problem statement.
- **Heap Usage:** Using a heap to manage the items is efficient and ensures that the best items are considered first.
- **Profit Calculation:** The profit calculation logic is consistent with the problem description.

### Edge Cases and Constraints

- The program handles the constraints well, including the additional constraint on the sum of `n` across all test cases.
- The logic for handling the first `k` items and the remaining items is sound and follows the problem's rules.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The program handles all aspects of the problem, including the optimal selection of items and the calculation of profit.
