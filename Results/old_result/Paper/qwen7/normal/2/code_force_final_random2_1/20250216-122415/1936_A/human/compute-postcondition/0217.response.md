Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `mak2` is `n-1`
   - `mak` is `n-1`
   - `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `pans` is a list containing `n-2`
   - `s` is an input string, which can either be `<` or `=`

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

Given the values from the initial state:
- `mak` is `n-1`
- `mak2` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`

The print statement will output the following:
- `'?'` (a literal string)
- `mak` which is `n-1`
- `mak2` which is `n-1`
- `i` which is `n-1`
- `mak2` which is `n-1`

So, the output will be:
Output: **'? n-1 n-1 n-1 n-1'**
