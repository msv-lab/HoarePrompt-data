Output State: **`a` retains its final state from the last iteration, `c` retains its final state from the last iteration, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` retains its final state from the last iteration, `y` retains its final state from the last iteration, `n` is an integer input value.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `l`. The other variables (`a`, `c`, `b`, `y`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation.
