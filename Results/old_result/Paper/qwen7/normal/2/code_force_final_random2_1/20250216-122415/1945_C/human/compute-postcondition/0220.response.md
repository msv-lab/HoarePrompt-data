Output State: `lst` must be empty, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its final value after the last iteration and `abs(pk - ele)` for the last element in `lst`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `lst` will be empty because each element will be processed, and `mini` will hold the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` encountered during the loop's execution.
