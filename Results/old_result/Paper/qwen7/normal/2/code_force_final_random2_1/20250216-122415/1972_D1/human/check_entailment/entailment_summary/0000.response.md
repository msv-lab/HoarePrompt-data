Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\), calculating a value \(x\) based on the formula \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\), and summing these values to get the total count of valid pairs. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Inner Loop**: The original code snippet has an inner loop that is commented out. This suggests that the current implementation might not be solving the problem correctly as intended.

2. **Formula for \(x\)**: The formula \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\) does not seem to directly relate to the problem statement. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which is not addressed by the current formula.

3. **Range of \(i\)**: The range of \(i\) should be from 1 to \(a\), not 1 to \(b\). The current implementation uses \(b\) as the upper limit for \(i\).

4. **Calculation of GCD**: The program does not explicitly calculate the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd\)) of \(a\) and \(i\), which is necessary to check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these issues, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
