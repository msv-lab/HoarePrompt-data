Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3
- `n` is greater than 3
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `r` is the input string from the user
- `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`
- `prev` is 2 if `r` equals `'>'`; otherwise, `prev` remains 1

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Let's break down the values:

1. `v1` is `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 3, `v1` will be a number greater than 2.
2. `i` is explicitly given as 3.
3. `prev` depends on the user input `r`:
   - If `r == '>'`, then `prev` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `prev` is 1.

Therefore, the output will be a formatted string with the following components:
- The first `{v1}` will be `n-1`.
- The second `{i}` will be 3.
- The third `{v1}` will again be `n-1`.
- The fourth `{prev}` will either be 2 or 1 depending on the user input `r`.

Given this, the output will be one of the following two possibilities:
- If `r == '>'`, the output will be: `? [n-1] 3 [n-1] 2`
- If `r != '>'`, the output will be: `? [n-1] 3 [n-1] 1`

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only express `n-1` symbolically.

Output: **? [n-1] 3 [n-1] 2** or **? [n-1] 3 [n-1] 1** (depending on the user input `r`)
