Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is an input from the user, and `prev` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i`, which is 2, to the variable `prev`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `n` must still be greater than 1, `r` is still an input from the user, and `prev` is now 2.
