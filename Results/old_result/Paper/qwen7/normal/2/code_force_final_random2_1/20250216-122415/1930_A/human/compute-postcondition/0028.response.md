Output State: **`suma` is 0, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings starting with the second smallest number, `a` is the first element of `numbers` converted to an integer, `b` is the first element of `numbers` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `b`. Since `numbers` was sorted in ascending order except for the first element, after popping the first element, `numbers` now starts with the second smallest number. The other variables remain unchanged.
