Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `x`, `l`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `x`: This variable will take on each element from the list `l` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `l`: This is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `l` must contain at least one element. If `l` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `l` is the only list involved in the loop, and it must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `l` has at least one element.
   - The initial value of `x` is not specified, but it will take on the values from `l` during each iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `l` must be a list with at least one integer element.
- `x` will take on the values from `l` during each iteration, but its specific value is not relevant to the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0**
