Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of strings containing the split input from the user, `bb` is a list of strings created from the split input.**

Explanation: The code `bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to a string. These strings are then stored in the list `bb`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The list `aa` is mentioned in the initial state but is not modified by the given code.
