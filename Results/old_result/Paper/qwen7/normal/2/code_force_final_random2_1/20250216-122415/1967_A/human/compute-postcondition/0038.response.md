Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` being true or false. If the condition is true, `r` is `a[3] + 0 // 4`, `rem` is `0 % 4`, `y` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, `k` is decreased by the value `(3 + 1) * (a[4] - a[3])`, and `r` is equal to `a[4]`.
