Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to the sum of all `f` values entered over all iterations, `j` is `m`, `f` is the last integer from the input in the final iteration, `a` is the first integer from the input in the final iteration, `b` is the second integer from the input in the final iteration, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet calculates `cn2` as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is a mathematical operation involving `n`. However, the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, and no input is provided within the given code snippet to assign a value to `n`. Therefore, `cn2` is simply defined as the expression `n * (n - 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
