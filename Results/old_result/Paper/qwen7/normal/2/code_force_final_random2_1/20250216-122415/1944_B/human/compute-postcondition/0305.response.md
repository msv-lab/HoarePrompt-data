Output State: **`i` is 3, the length of list `l` is now 2, and `k` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and the length of list `l` is either 1, 2, or 3. Since `i` is 3, `b[i]` refers to the element at index 3 in list `b`. This is the first time `b[i]` is being appended to `l`, so the length of `l` increases by 1. The length of `l` was initially either 1, 2, or 3, so after appending, the length of `l` will be 2 (since it cannot be 3, as `i` is 3 and we are only appending once). The value of `k` remains unchanged at 0 because no condition was met to change its value.
