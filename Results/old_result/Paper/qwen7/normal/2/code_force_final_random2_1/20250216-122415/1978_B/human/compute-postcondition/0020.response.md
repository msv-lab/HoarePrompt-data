Postcondition: `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `low` is either `mid + 1` or remains unchanged, `high` is either `mid - 1` or remains unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, and `profit_next` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
