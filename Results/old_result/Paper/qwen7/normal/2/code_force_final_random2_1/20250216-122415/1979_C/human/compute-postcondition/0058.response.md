Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.
2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sumo` is increased by `int(a[1]) + int(a[2])`
   - `i` is 2
   - `bets` is a positive integer
   - `a[1]` is equal to `prod // a[1]`
3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `i < bets`.
4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `bets` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration.

Given these points, we can now construct the new state for the start of the next iteration of the loop.

**State: **`sumo` is increased by int(a[1]) + int(a[2]), `i` is 3, `bets` is a positive integer, `a[1]` is equal to `prod // a[1]`**
