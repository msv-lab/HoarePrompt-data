Output State: **`results` list now contains 'NO', while all other variables (`only_a`, `only_b`, `total_distinct`, `unique_a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `both`) remain unchanged.**

The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values or the state of the list `results`. It simply continues to the next iteration of the loop (if there is one). Therefore, the only information that remains valid is the initial state of `results` and the unchanged status of all other variables.
