Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ii` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`
     - If true, `k` becomes 0 and `r` is set to `a[0]`.
     - Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is updated to `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` remains 0 while `y` and `i` reset to 0.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been `n-2`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `ii` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `k`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `i` need to be adjusted based on the condition for the next iteration.

Given the condition for the next iteration:
- If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` holds true, then `k` becomes 0 and `r` is set to `a[0]`.
- Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is updated to `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` remains 0 while `y` and `i` reset to 0.

Since `i` will be `n-1` in the next iteration, we need to consider both cases:
- If the condition holds true: `k` becomes 0 and `r` is set to `a[0]`.
- Otherwise: `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is updated to `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` remains 0 while `y` and `i` reset to 0.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `a[i+1]` or the current value of `k`, we can only state the general conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` (if true, `k` becomes 0 and `r` is set to `a[0]`; otherwise, `k` is reduced, `r` is updated, and `rem` remains 0 while `y` and `i` reset to 0)**.
