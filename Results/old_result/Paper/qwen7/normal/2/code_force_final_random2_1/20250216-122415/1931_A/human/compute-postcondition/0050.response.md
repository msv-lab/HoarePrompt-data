Output State: **`arr` is [26, lex], `j` is 1, `lex` is either 0 or within the range [-26, 52]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the elements [26, 26]. After appending `lex`, `arr` becomes [26, lex]. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial states.
