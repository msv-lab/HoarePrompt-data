Output State: **`i` is 7, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to 'chr(info[6][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][4] + 96)', `j` is 4**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by adding `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 7 and `j` is 4. So, `temp` is updated to include `chr(info[7][4] + 96)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
