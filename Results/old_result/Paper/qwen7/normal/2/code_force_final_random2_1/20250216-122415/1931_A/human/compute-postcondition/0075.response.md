Output State: **`j` is either 0 or 1; `lex` is between 27 and 78 (inclusive); `arr` is a list containing the elements 1 and 26.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains either `1` or `26`. After appending `1`, `arr` will contain both `1` and `26`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
