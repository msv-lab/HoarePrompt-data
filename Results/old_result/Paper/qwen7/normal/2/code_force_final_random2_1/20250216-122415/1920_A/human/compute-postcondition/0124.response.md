Output State: **`no` is an empty list, `num` is less than or equal to its initial value minus the length of the original `no` list, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `iterable` is one more than it was at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The line `big = []` initializes the list `big` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
