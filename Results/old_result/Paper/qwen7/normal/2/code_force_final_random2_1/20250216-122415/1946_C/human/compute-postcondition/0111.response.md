Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 3; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `adj[a]` now contains `b`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, they remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 also remains unaffected. The value of `i` is still 2.
