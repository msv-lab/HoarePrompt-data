Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `r` is n - 1, `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[r]`, and `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `sunks` is 1, `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `sunks`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
