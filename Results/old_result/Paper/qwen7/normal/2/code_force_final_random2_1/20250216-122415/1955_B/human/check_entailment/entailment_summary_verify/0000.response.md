Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` as inputs.
   - It finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It generates a new list `li` by iterating over all positions in the progressive square and calculating the corresponding values using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`.
   - Both `l` and `li` are sorted.
   - The function checks if the sorted list `l` matches the sorted list `li` and returns 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Function Summary

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`:
- It generates a list `li` based on the minimum value in `l` and the parameters `c` and `d`.
- Both `l` and `li` are sorted.
- The function returns 'YES' if the sorted lists match, otherwise 'NO'.

### Verification Against the Original Assessment

The original assessment suggested that the program incorrectly assumes the smallest element in `l` is `a_{1,1}` without verification. However, upon closer inspection, the program correctly identifies the smallest element in `l` as `a` and uses it to generate the progressive square. The sorting step ensures that the smallest element in `l` is correctly aligned with the smallest element in the generated list `li`.

Given the problem constraints and the function's behavior, the program correctly handles the generation and verification of the progressive square. The sorting step ensures that the smallest element in `l` is correctly identified and used in the comparison.

### Conclusion

The original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly identifies and uses the smallest element in `l` as `a_{1,1}` and then verifies the entire sequence. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
