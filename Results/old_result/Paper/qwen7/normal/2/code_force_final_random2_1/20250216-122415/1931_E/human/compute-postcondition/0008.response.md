Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop condition. In this case, the loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(num) - 1` to `0` in reverse order, decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.
   - `i` is `len(num) - 1`.
   - `tot` is 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(num) - 2`.

5. **Maintain other states**: The state of `num` and `tot` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to these variables.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `tot` is 1**.
