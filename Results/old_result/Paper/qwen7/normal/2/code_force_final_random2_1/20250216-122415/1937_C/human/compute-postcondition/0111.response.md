Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` equals '>', and `prev` will be equal to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Given that the loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`, it will execute `n-1` times. Each time the loop runs, `prev` is updated to the current value of `i`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`, and `prev` will be the last value assigned to it, which is `n-1`. The value of `r` must be '>', as per the provided output states after each iteration.
