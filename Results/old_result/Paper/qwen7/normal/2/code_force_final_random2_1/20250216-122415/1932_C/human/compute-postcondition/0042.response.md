Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list where each element is the product of the corresponding element in `a` and all the elements that come after it in reverse order.**

Note: The given output description seems to be slightly off from the actual task described in the function signature. Based on the function signature, the function does not involve the parameter `m` and the string `s`. The focus is on processing the list `a` according to the specified operation.
