Output State: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop continues to execute as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`. After the first iteration, `cnt` becomes 0, which means the condition `cnt > 0` is no longer satisfied. Therefore, the loop will stop executing after the first iteration. The value of `l` remains `func_2() + 1` because it is updated inside the loop but not changed outside of it. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
