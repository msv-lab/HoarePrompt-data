Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans2`. Initially, `i` is 1, so the element at index 1 of list `l` is appended to `ans2`. After this operation, `i` is incremented (though the increment is not shown in the given code snippet, it is implied by the typical behavior of such operations), making `i` equal to 2. The value of `ans1` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.
