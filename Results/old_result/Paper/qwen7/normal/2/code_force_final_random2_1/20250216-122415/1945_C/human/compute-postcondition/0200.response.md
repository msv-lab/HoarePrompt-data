Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `zero` is either 2 or 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one` is either 1 or 2, `one_perc` is 0, `lst` is a list containing 1 and 2**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is initially 1, `i + 1` equals 2. Therefore, `lst` becomes `[1, 2]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
