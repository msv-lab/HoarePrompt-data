### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not follow the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1` is defined to process a string consisting of `@` and `*` characters, which is unrelated to the periodicity of signs.
   - `func_2` reads input but calls `func_1` with the input string, which again processes the string rather than calculating the year when all signs will occur.

2. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires finding the year when all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially, based on their periodicities.
   - The periodicity of each sign is given as a series of integers, and the program needs to determine the year when the sequence of signs will align.

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - For each sign, the program should find the next occurrence after the previous sign has occurred.
   - This involves iterating through the periodicities and calculating the cumulative delay until all signs align.

Given these points, the current implementation is fundamentally flawed and does not address the problem at hand. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

**Final: False**
