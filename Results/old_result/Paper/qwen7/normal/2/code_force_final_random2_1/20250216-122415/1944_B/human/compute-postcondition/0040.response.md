Output State: **`k` is an integer and does not equal 0, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`; `l` is a list that now includes the element `b[i]`.**

The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `l`. The conditions on `k`, `b[i]`, and `b[i-1]` and `b[i+1]` remain unchanged.
