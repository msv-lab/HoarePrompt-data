Postcondition: **`y` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`. The element at index `x` of list `l` is greater than both `a` and `b`. The current difference between the element at index `x` of list `l` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between the element at index `x` of list `l` and `b`.**
