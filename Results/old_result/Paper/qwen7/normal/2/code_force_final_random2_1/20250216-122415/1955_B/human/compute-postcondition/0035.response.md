Postcondition: **`k` is equal to `n`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is equal to `n-1`, `li` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, each calculated as `a + n * c, a + (n-1) * c + d, a + (n-2) * c + 2d, ..., a + d * (n-1)`. The current state of `li` is equal to the original list `li`**.
