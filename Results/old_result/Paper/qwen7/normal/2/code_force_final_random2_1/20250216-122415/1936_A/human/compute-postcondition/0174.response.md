Output State: **`mak` is equal to `len(pans) - 1`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed in each iteration.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `mak` will hold the value `len(pans) - 1`, indicating that `mak` has been updated to the last index of the list `pans` during each iteration where the input was `'>'.` The `sys.stdout.flush()` function is called in each iteration to ensure the output is immediately sent to the standard output.
