Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `prev` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is a string input from the last iteration, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n`, `v2` is `n-1`, if `r` equals '<', `v1` becomes `n-1`**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `prev` remains `n-1` because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `r` will be the input string from the last iteration of the loop. The variables `g`, `kp`, `v1`, and `v2` will be set to `0`, `1`, `n`, and `n-1` respectively, with `v1` potentially becoming `n-1` if the input string `r` was '<' in the last iteration.
