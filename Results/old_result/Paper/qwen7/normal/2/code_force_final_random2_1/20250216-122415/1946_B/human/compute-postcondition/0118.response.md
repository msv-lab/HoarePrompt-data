Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`, and `t` is the maximum value encountered during the loop execution.**

Explanation: The loop processes each element in the list `a`. For each element `x` in `a`, `tmp` accumulates the sum of elements. If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to 0. The variable `t` keeps track of the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop's execution. Since the loop processes all elements in `a`, after the loop completes, `a` will be empty (as it is modified in place by adding elements to `tmp`), `tmp` will hold the final maximum value of `tmp` (which is also the value of `t`), and `t` will be the highest value `tmp` reached during the loop.
