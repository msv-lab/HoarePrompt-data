Output State: **`combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `removed_item` is the item pushed into the heap; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the sum of the first and second elements of `removed_item`.**

Explanation: The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs two operations:
1. It pushes the `item` into the heap.
2. It removes and returns the smallest item from the heap (which is now the `removed_item`).

The condition for adjusting `current_profit` is based on the sum of the first and second elements of `removed_item`. If the sum is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `removed_item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `removed_item`.
