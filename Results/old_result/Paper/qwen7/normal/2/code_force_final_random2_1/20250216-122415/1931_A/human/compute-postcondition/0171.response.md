Output State: **`i` is 5, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 'a', `j` must be between 0 and 2 inclusive**

Explanation: The code `temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)` appends a character to `temp`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, `j` is between 0 and 2 inclusive, and `info[i][j]` is assumed to be a numeric value that corresponds to a letter in the alphabet (since `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` converts a number to a character). For simplicity, let's assume `info[4][0]` is 1, which corresponds to 'a'. Thus, `temp` becomes 'a'. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 5. The conditions for `cases` and `j` remain unchanged.
