The only variable in the loop head is `new_median`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_median`. If `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma] + 1`, and `median` is also equal to `b[ma] + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`. Since `new_median` and `median` are currently equal, `new_median` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `median`.

State: **`op` is 2, `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `median` is `b[ma] + 1, new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`**
