Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))]
                    )
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all_new and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and the output is either 'YES' or 'NO'. If `check_all` is true, the program checks if there exists a segment in `a` starting from any index `i` to the end where all elements are greater than or equal to `a[0]` and all elements are non-decreasing. If such a segment is found, the output is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'. If `check_all` is false, the output is 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is equal to `n`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, and `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, and `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is True, then `new_all` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `new` is updated to a list containing elements from `a[n-1:]`, `check_all_new` is determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`, and `new_all` is determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]). If `check_all_new and new_all` are met for any `i` in the range of the length of `new`, the output is 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
