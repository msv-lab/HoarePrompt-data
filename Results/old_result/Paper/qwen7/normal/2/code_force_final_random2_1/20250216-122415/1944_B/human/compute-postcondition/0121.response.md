Output State: **`k` is -2, `ans1` is a list including `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[i_prev+1]`, and `l[i]`, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `ans2` is a list including `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[i_prev+1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `l[i]` to `ans1`. Since `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `ans1` now includes `l[0]`, `l[1]`, `l[i_prev+1]`, and `l[i]`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation, and `ans2` remains unaffected by this operation.
