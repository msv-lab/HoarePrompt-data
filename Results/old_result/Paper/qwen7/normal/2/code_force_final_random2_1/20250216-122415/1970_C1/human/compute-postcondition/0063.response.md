Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer from the first part of the input, `v` is an input integer from the second part of the input, `tree` is either a list or a deque with one or two elements, and `tree` now has `u` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the `tree` list or deque. Since `u` and `v` are assigned the values from the input split into integers, `u` is added to `tree`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
