Output State: **`sumo` is 0, `t` is the same as before, `i` is 0, `bets` must be a positive integer, `prod` is multiplied by `a[bets]` three times, `ans` is the concatenation of 'a[0]', 'a[1]', and 'a[3]' with spaces in between if `sumo` is less than `prod * a[bets]^2`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `sumo = 0` initializes `sumo` to 0. This updates the value of `sumo`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `bets`, `prod`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
