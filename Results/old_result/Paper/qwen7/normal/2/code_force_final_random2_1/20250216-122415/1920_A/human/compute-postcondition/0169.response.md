Output State: **`i` is an integer, `i` is one less than its original value if it was within the range defined by the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged; `no`, `less`, and `big` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `num -= 1` decrements the value of `i` by 1. However, the condition specified in the initial state must still be respected. If `i` was originally within the range defined by the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, then `i` is now one less than its original value. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged. The variables `no`, `less`, and `big` are not affected by this operation.
