Output State: **`s` is not empty, `c` is the next character in `s`, `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans` plus the number of zeroes minus `cnt[0]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` updates the variable `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to its current value. The other variables (`s`, `c`, and `cnt[c]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
