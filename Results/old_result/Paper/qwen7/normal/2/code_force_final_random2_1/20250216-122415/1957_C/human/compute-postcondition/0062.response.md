Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `k`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < k`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is an integer from the input.
   - `r` is an integer from the input.
   - If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is increased by 1.
   - If `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is increased by 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value less than `k`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.

Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `k`, and `k` remains unchanged, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

5. **New state**:
   - `k` remains the same (must be greater than 0).
   - `c` remains the same (an integer from the input).
   - `r` remains the same (an integer from the input).
   - `num` remains the same (its value does not affect the loop condition).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
