Output State: **`i` is the next value from the list `no` - 1, `no` remains unchanged, `less` remains unchanged, `big` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so it becomes the next value from the list `no` minus 1. The other variables (`no`, `less`, and `big`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
