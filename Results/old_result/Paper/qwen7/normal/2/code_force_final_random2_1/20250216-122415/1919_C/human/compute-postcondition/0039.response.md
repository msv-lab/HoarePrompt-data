Output State: **`x` is `y + 1`, `x` must be less than `n`, `l[x]` is equal to `b`, and `(a - l[x]) > (b - l[x])`**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of `l[x]`. According to the initial conditions, `l[x]` was less than both `a` and `b`, and `(a - l[x]) > (b - l[x])`. After assigning `b = l[x]`, the condition `(a - l[x]) > (b - l[x])` still holds true because `b` now equals `l[x]`. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
