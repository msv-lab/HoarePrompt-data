Output State: **`v` is the return value of `func_2()`, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `n-1`**

Explanation: The code `v = func_2()` simply assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `v`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
