You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and each query consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n.

    #State: Output State: `u` is `False`, `c` is the first return value from function `r()`, `d` is the second return value from function `r()`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `u` will be `False` because it is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs, and it starts as the number of iterations required to reach the final state. The values of `c` and `d` will hold the return values of the last call to function `r()` within the loop, as the loop terminates when `u` becomes `False`. The other variables such as `t`, `a`, and `b` will remain in their final states after the loop completes, but since no specific changes to these variables are mentioned in the loop body, they will retain their values from the last iteration or initialization.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n, a strictly increasing list a of n non-negative integers, and an integer m representing the number of queries. It then handles m queries, where each query consists of two distinct integers x and y. Based on these inputs, the function calculates and prints the result for each query according to specific conditions. After processing all queries for a test case, the function moves on to the next test case until all test cases are processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to use a lambda function and a complex calculation involving `b` and `a` arrays, but this approach does not align with the problem description.

To solve the problem, we need to identify the closest city for each city and then calculate the minimum cost to travel between any two cities using the rules provided. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_closest_city(n, a):
    closest = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        min_distance = float('inf')
        closest_city_index = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                distance = abs(a[i] - a[j])
                if distance < min_distance:
                    min_distance = distance
                    closest_city_index = j
        closest[i] = closest_city_index
    return closest

def min_coins_to_travel(n, a, queries, closest):
    result = []
    for (x, y) in queries:
        if x == y:
            result.append(0)
        elif x < y:
            cost = 1 + min_coins_to_travel_helper(a, x, y, closest)
            result.append(cost)
        else:
            cost = 1 + min_coins_to_travel_helper(a, y, x, closest)
            result.append(cost)
    return result

def min_coins_to_travel_helper(a, x, y, closest):
    if x == y:
        return 0
    if x == closest[x]:
        return abs(a[x] - a[y])
    return 1 + min_coins_to_travel_helper(a, closest[x], y, closest)

def process_test_case():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        m = int(input())
        queries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        
        closest = find_closest_city(n, a)
        result = min_coins_to_travel(n, a, queries, closest)
        for res in result:
            print(res)

process_test_case()
```

This corrected program first identifies the closest city for each city and then calculates the minimum cost to travel between any two cities according to the rules provided. The given program does not correctly implement these steps, hence the output is incorrect for certain inputs.
