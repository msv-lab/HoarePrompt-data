Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumo` is increased by the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.
- `i` equals `bets`.
- `bets` is a positive integer.
- `a[1]` to `a[bets-1]` are updated to their respective integer divisions by themselves.
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The print statement is simply `print(-1)`. This means it will print the integer `-1` regardless of the values of other variables.

Output: **-1**
