Postcondition: `m` is 3, `val` is a list containing exactly 3 tuples, each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`). If `l3` is not equal to a list created by iterating through `l` and including only elements that are not equal to `a3`, then the condition remains as is. Otherwise, the condition also remains as is since there is no else part that changes the state.
