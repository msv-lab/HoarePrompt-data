Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2; `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split; `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split; `t` is equal to `b`; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = input().split()` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to variables `a` and `b`. Since the initial state did not specify the exact values of `t` and `t1`, their relationships remain unchanged. The other variables (`t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `t`) are updated according to the new input.
