Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, and `res` is either 'peak' if `y` is greater than `z`, 'stair' if `x` is less than `y` and `y` is not greater than `z`, or 'none' if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.
