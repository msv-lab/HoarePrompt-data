Output State: `totalOne` is equal to 0, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer `i + 1` is added to the list if the character at index `i` in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 (potentially missing the last element depending on the operations within the loop), `suffZero` is a list containing elements that were appended during the loop's execution, `ans` is a list of integers where each element is calculated based on the logic provided in the loop body, and `i` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed all its iterations).

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `totalOne` will be 0 because it is decremented in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `s1` remains unchanged throughout the process. The list `pre` will contain integers based on the characters in `s1`. The list `preOne` will have cumulative sums, possibly missing the last element. The list `suffZero` will contain elements that were appended during the loop. The list `ans` will have values calculated according to the given logic for each character in `s1`. The variable `i` will be -1, indicating the end of the loop.
