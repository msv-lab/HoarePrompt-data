Output State: **`combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order (excluding the last tuple which was popped), `heap` is a list containing one more tuple than before (the tuple that was popped from `combined`), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, and the condition `combined` is false.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops the last tuple from `combined` and pushes it into `heap`. Since `combined` was initially sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order (excluding the last tuple which was popped), popping the last tuple and pushing it into `heap` does not affect the sorting property of `combined`. The `heap` now contains one more tuple than before. All other variables remain unchanged.
