Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `tree` is a list containing one element `u`.**

The code `tree.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `tree`. Since `u` is an input integer, it adds `u` to the existing list `tree`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `v`) remain unchanged.
