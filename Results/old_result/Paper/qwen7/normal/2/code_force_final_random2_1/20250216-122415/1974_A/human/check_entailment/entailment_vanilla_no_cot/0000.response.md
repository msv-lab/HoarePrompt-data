Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons. The logic in the program is flawed and does not properly account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons and the remaining space available for the 1x1 icons.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        total_cells = (5 * 3)  # Total cells per screen
        large_icons = b * 4  # Total cells occupied by 2x2 icons
        small_icons = a  # Total cells needed for 1x1 icons

        # Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = total_cells - large_icons

        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
        screens_for_small_icons = (small_icons + remaining_cells - 1) // remaining_cells

        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_large_icons = (b + (total_cells - large_icons) // 4 - 1) // (total_cells // 4)

        # Total screens required
        total_screens = max(screens_for_small_icons, screens_for_large_icons)
        print(total_screens)


func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons is handled correctly and calculates the minimum number of screens required accurately.
