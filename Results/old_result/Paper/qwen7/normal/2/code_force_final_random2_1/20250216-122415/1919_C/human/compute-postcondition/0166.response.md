Output State: **`y` is `n - 2`, `x` is `n - 1`, `b` is `l[x]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `l[x]` to the variable `b`. Given the initial state where `y` is `n - 2` and `x` is `n - 1`, the value of `b` is set to the element at index `x` in list `l`. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged.
