Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is either less than 27 or within the range [26, 78]; `arr` is a list containing the elements 26, 26**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Since `arr` initially contained the element 26, after appending another 26, it now contains both elements. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
