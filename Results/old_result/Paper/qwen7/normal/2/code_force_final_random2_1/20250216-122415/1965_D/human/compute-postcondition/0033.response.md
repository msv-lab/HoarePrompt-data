Functionality: **The function accepts a list `odds` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a symmetric list `a` of size `n` where each element is calculated based on the corresponding element in `odds`. For each element `x` in `odds`, if the index `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` holds the last value of `x` from `odds` and `idx` starts at -1.**
