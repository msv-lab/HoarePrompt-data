Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [(x - mod_x) % x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]** 

Explanation:
- `num` is the original number.
- `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This means if `mod_x` is 0, `required_mod_x` will be 0; otherwise, it will be `x - mod_x`.
- `required_mod_y` is directly equal to `mod_y`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` based on the given conditions.
