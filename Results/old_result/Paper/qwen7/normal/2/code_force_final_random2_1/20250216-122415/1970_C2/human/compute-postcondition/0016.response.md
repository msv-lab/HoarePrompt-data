Output State: `i` is \(n-1\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing \(n-1\) pairs of integers \((u, v)\), `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `empty` is `False`, `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where each key \(u\) has a value that is a list of all vertices \(v\) connected to \(u\) (and vice versa).

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, variable `i` will be \(n-1\). The variable `n` remains within the given range. Variable `t` stays as 1. The `edges` list will contain exactly \(n-1\) pairs of integers representing the edges in the graph. The `start` variable remains an integer between 1 and \(n\). The `empty` variable becomes `False`. The `nodes` dictionary will represent the adjacency list of the graph, where for each node \(u\), `nodes[u]` will contain a list of all nodes \(v\) that are directly connected to \(u\), and similarly for `nodes[v]`.
