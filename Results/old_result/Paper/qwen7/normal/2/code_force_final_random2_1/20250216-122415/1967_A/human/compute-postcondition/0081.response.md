Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 3`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no loop or if statement was specified in the code, the only effect is that we know a break occurred.
