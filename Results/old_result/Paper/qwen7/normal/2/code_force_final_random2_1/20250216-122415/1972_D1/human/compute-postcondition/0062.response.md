Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is `int(info[0])`
   - `b` must be at least 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `x` is `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`
   - `suma` is `x`
   - If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, then `suma` remains `x`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `b + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - Since `i` is now 3, we need to check the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` to determine if `suma` should remain `x`.

5. **Calculate the new value of `x`**:
   - `x` is defined as `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(a - 2) // 2`.
   - This value does not change with each iteration of the loop.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `suma` will remain `x` unless the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` is false. However, since we don't know the exact value of `a` and `b`, we assume the condition holds true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `x` is `(a - 2) // 2`, and `suma` is `x`.**
