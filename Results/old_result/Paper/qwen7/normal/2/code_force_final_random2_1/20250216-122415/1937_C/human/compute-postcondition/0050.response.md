Output State: **`min_index` is equal to `min_index`, `i` is equal to `max_index`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of the function `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` to the variable `res`. The values of `min_index` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new variable introduced is `res`, which holds the return value of the function call.
