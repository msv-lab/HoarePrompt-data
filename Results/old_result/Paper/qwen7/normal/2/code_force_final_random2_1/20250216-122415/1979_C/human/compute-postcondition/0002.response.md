Output State: **`t` is 0, `bets` is an input integer**

The code assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `bets`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0 and the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 is not relevant here since `t` is not being modified.
