Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer, `arr` is [1, 26], `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` is either `[1]` or `[26]` depending on the value of `lex`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[1, 26]` if it was initially `[1]`, or `[26, 26]` if it was initially `[26]`. However, since the exact value of `lex` is not specified, we can generalize that `arr` will be `[1, 26]` in both cases. All other variables remain unchanged.
