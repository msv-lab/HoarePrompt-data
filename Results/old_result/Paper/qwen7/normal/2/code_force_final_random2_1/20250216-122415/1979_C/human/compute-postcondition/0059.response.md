Output State: **`sumo` is increased by int(a[1]) + int(a[2]), `i` is 3, `bets` is a positive integer, `a[1]` is equal to `prod // a[1]`, `a[3]` is equal to `prod // a[3]`**

Explanation: The code updates `a[3]` to be `prod // a[3]`. The other variables (`sumo`, `i`, `bets`, and `a[1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
