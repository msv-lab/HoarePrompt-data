Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`), `m` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The original `val` list, which contains a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`), remains unchanged. The value of `m` is explicitly set to 2 and remains unchanged.
