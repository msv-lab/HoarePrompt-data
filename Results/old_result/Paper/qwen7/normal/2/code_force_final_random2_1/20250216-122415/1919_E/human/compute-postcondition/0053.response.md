Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and the loop iterates over `range(2 * n + 1)`. This means `j` takes values from 0 to \(2 * n\).

2. **Understand the loop body**: The loop updates `new_dp[j - 1]` based on the value of `new_dp[j]` and `dp[j]`. Specifically, if \(j - 1 \geq 0\), then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\). Otherwise, `new_dp[j - 1]` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `new_dp[j]` is the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0`, modulo `MOD`.
   - If \(j - 1 \geq 0\), then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\).
   - `i` is set to `m + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop variable `j` will increment by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be \(j + 1\).
   - Since `i` is set to `m + 1` at the end of the loop, it does not change within the loop itself.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `new_dp[j]` will be the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0`, modulo `MOD`, for the new value of `j`.
   - If \(j - 1 \geq 0\), then `new_dp[j - 1]` will be updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\).

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be \(j + 1\).

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `new_dp[j]` will be the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0`, modulo `MOD`, for the new value of `j`.
- If \(j - 1 \geq 0\), then `new_dp[j - 1]` will be updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\).

Since `i` is set to `m + 1` at the end of the loop, it remains unchanged within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`new_dp[j]` is the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0`, modulo `MOD`, for the new value of `j`, and if \(j - 1 \geq 0\), then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\), and `i` is `m + 1`.**
