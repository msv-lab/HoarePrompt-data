Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ln` is an input integer, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `palka` that have a count of occurrences of 3 or more in the list `palka`, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, the remaining number of iterations `w` is `w - 1`, `palka` is updated to a list of integers from user input.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in `d`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`. If `i` is already in `d`, then `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, and `d` is a dictionary. If the second element of the original `palka` is not in `d`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 1}`. If the second element of the original `palka` is already in `d`, then `d[second_element_of_palka]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not a key in dictionary `d`, then `d` is updated to contain the key-value pairs `{second_element_of_palka: 3, i: 1}`. If `i` is a key in dictionary `d`, then `d` is updated to contain the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 3}`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
