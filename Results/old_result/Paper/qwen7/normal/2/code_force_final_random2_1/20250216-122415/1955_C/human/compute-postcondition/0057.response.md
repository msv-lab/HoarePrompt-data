Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is equal to 1, `a[l]` is 0, `k` is now k - 2 * a[r], `l` is increased by 1, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`**.

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
