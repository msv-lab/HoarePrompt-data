Output State: **`idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list, and the input is split into `a3` and `l3` where `a3` is the first element and `l3` is a list of the remaining elements.**

The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes the input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
