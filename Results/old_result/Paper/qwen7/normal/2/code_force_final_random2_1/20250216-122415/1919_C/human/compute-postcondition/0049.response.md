Postcondition: `x` is `y + 1`, `x` is less than `n`, and `l[x]` is either equal to `a` or `b`. If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `l[x]` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`. If `l[x]` is not less than `a` and not less than `b`, then `l[x]` is set to `a` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `l[x]` is set to `b`.
