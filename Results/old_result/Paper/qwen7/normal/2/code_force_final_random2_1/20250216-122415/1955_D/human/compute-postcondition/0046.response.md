Postcondition: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` and `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `pairs_in_D` is either increased by 1 or decreased by 1 depending on the condition. `C[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` may be updated according to the condition. `aa` must have at least `n` elements. `m` must be less than `n`. `n - m` must be greater than 0. `in_aa` will take the next element from `aa[m:]`. `out_aa` will take the next element from `aa[:n - m]`. If `E[out_aa] <= 0`, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, `fnd` remains unchanged, `C[in_aa]` and `D[in_aa]` may be updated according to the condition, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is now equal to `C[out_aa] + 1`.**
