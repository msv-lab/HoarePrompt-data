Output State: **`s` is not empty, `c` is the next character in `s`, `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0 before the increment, else `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code increments `ans` by 1 only if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Since `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `cnt[1]` (assuming `c` is '1') will now be 1, which means `ans` will be incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
