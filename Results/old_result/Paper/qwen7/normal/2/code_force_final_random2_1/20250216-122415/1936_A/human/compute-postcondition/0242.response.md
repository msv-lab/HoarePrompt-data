Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is `n-1`.
   - `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Evaluating the Print Statement:**
   - `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` refers to the first element of the list `pans`, which is `n-2`.
   - `pans[mak]`: Again, this is `n-2`.
   - `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 1, `pans[i]` refers to the second element of the list `pans`, which is `n-1`.
   - `pans[i]`: This is also `n-1`.

4. **Constructing the Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values `n-2`, `n-2`, `n-1`, and `n-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? n-2 n-2 n-1 n-1'**
