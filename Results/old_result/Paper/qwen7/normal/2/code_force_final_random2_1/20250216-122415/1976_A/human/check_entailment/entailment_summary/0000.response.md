Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function separates the password into two lists: one for digits and one for letters.
   - It sorts these lists.
   - It then checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order and ensures that no digit is greater than any preceding letter.
   - Finally, it constructs a new password from the sorted digits followed by the sorted letters and compares it with the original password to ensure the order is maintained.

2. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each case.
   - For each password, it calls `func_1` and prints "YES" if the function returns `True`, otherwise "NO".

Given the execution summary and the detailed explanation above, the program correctly verifies whether a password is strong according to the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
