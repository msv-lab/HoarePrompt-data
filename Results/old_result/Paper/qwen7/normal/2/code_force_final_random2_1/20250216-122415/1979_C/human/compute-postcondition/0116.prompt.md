Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = 1
    for i in range(bets):
        prod *= a[i]
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `bets`, `sumo` will be increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]` + ... + the integer value of `a[bets-1]`, `bets` must be greater than 0, and `a[i]` will be assigned the value of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `bets`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function does not change `sumo` further. Otherwise, `ans` will contain a string of the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` concatenated with spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` is a positive integer greater than 2, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1` if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, otherwise `ans` is the concatenation of 'a[0]', 'a[1]', and 'a[3]' with spaces in between.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < bets`, and `sumo` is increased by `int(a[bets-1])`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then `sumo` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `bets`, `ans` contains the string representations of all elements in `a` separated by spaces, and no further changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
