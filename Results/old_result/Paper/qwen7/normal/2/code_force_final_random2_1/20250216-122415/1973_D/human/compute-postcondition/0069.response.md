Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n // k + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is 1
   - `k` must be 1
   - `cnt` is non-zero-1 (less than or equal to 0)
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 1
   - The condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` holds true

3. **Check if the loop can execute again**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n // k + 1`.
   - Given `n` is 1 and `k` is 1, `n // k + 1` evaluates to `1 // 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < 2`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 in the previous iteration, it cannot be incremented further because `i` needs to be less than 2 for the loop to continue.
   - Thus, the loop will not execute again based on the current values of `i`, `n`, and `k`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop cannot execute again with the current values of `i`, `n`, and `k`.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is non-zero-1 (less than or equal to 0), `l` is `func_2()` + 1, and the condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` holds true.**
