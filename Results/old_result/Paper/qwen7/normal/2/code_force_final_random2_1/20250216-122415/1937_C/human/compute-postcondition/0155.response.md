Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string from the user, `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`, and `prev` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 2) to `prev`. The values of other variables (`i`, `n`, `v2`, `r`, `v1`, and `prev`) are updated accordingly, but the conditions and relationships between them remain the same.
