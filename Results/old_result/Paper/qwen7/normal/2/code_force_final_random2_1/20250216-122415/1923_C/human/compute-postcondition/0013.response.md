Output State: **`x` is the next element in `l`, `c` is the updated value of `c` plus `x`, `p` is a list containing the updated value of `c`**.

Explanation: The code `c += x` updates the value of `c` by adding the value of `x` to it. The value of `x` is the next element in the list `l`. The variable `p` is a list that contains the updated value of `c`. Therefore, after executing the code, `c` is updated, and `p` reflects this update.
