Output State: **`y` is -1, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the first element of the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `l` to the variable `a`. Since `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` now holds the first integer from that list. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged.
