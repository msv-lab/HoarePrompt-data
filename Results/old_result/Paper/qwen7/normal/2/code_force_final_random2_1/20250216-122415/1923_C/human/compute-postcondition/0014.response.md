Output State: **`x` is the next element in `l`, `c` is the updated value of `c` plus `x`, `p` is a list containing the updated value of `c` appended.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p.append(c)` appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. The values of `x` and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes that `p` now contains the updated value of `c` appended to it.
