Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus 2, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 6, `path` is the string from the 6th line of the `data` list, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list converted to an integer, and `results` has been appended with the return value of `func_1(path)`**.

In more natural language, the output state is: `results` now contains its original elements plus the return value of `func_1(path)` again, `t` is still the integer value from the first line of `data` minus 2, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is still 6, `path` is still the string from the 6th line of `data`, `n` is now the integer value from the second line of `data`, and `results` has been updated to include the return value of `func_1(path)` at the end.
