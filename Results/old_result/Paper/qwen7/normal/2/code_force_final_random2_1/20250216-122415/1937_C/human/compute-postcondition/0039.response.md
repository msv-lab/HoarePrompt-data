Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `min_indices` contains `i` appended to it**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to the list `min_indices`. The initial state of `i` is `n-1`, and the initial state of `min_indices` is a list containing the first minimum index (since `min_indices[0]` is used). After appending `i` to `min_indices`, the list `min_indices` now contains the original first minimum index and `n-1`.
