Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the element at index `a` which now contains `[b, a]` and `[b]`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 3, `n` is the same as before, `adj[b].append(a)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `a` to the list `adj[b]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The updated state of `adj` is that the list at index `b` now includes `a`.
