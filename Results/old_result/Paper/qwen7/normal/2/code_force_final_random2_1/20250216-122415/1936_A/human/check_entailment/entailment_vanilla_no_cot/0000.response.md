Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem within the specified constraints:

1. **Incorrect Query Strategy**: The code attempts to find the maximum XOR by comparing the bitwise OR of pairs, but it does not effectively utilize the information gained from these comparisons to identify the indices with the maximum XOR. Specifically, the logic for determining `mak` and `pans` is flawed and does not guarantee finding the optimal pair.

2. **Query Limit**: While the code is designed to make at most 3n queries, the strategy used is inefficient and may exceed this limit in many cases. The approach of repeatedly querying the same elements is not optimal for finding the maximum XOR.

3. **Lack of Proper XOR Maximization Logic**: The solution does not have a clear and effective method to maximize the XOR value. It relies on comparing OR values, which does not directly lead to finding the pair with the maximum XOR.

A more effective approach would involve leveraging the properties of XOR and OR operations to efficiently find the pair with the maximum XOR. One possible strategy involves identifying the most significant bit (MSB) and then using that information to narrow down the potential candidates for the maximum XOR.

Here's a revised approach that might work better:

```python
import sys

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        # Initialize variables to store the indices with the highest MSB set
        max_xor = 0
        index1 = -1
        index2 = -1
        
        # Find the index with the highest MSB set
        for i in range(n):
            print(f"? {i} {i} {i} {i}", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '=':
                continue
            else:
                break
        for i in range(n):
            print(f"? {i} {i} {i} {i}", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '=':
                continue
            else:
                break
        # Use binary search or similar to find the pair with the maximum XOR
        low, high = 0, n-1
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            print(f"? {low} {high} {mid} {mid}", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            res = str(input())
            if res == ">":
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        index1 = low
        # Find the second index with the maximum XOR
        for i in range(n):
            print(f"? {index1} {index1} {i} {i}", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            res = str(input())
            if res == ">":
                index2 = i
                break
        print(f"! {index1} {index2}")
        sys.stdout.flush()

func()
```

This approach uses binary search to find the index with the highest MSB set and then finds the second index that maximizes the XOR. This should help in reducing the number of queries and finding the correct pair more efficiently.
