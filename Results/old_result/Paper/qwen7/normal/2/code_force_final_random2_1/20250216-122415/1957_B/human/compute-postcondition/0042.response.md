Output State: **`l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are `(1 << n) - 1`, `k - ((1 << n) - 1)`, and 0, `temp` is either 16, 8, or 4, the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` takes the first two elements from `l1`, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The other variables (`arr`, `ans`, `temp`) remain unchanged. The conditions on `n` and `k` are preserved, and `n` is guaranteed to be an integer and `k` is guaranteed to be an integer.
