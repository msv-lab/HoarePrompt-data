Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the numerator and denominator without considering the probability of choosing each pair.

The program calculates `p` and `q` as follows:
- `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
- `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`

However, the correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion and then multiplying by k. The expected value for each excursion is the sum of the probabilities of choosing each pair multiplied by their respective friendship values.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```

The correct expected value calculation should be:
- There are 1 pair of friends with a friendship value of 1.
- The probability of choosing this pair in one excursion is 1/2.
- The expected value for one excursion is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 0.5 \).
- For k excursions, the expected value is \( 0.5 \times k \).

However, the program calculates:
- `cn2 = 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 = 0`
- `sum_f = 1`
- `p = 2 * 1 * 0 * 1 + 1 * 1 * (1 - 1) = 0`
- `q = 2 * 0 ** 2 = 0`

Since `q` is 0, the program fails to handle this case correctly and produces an invalid result. This demonstrates that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
