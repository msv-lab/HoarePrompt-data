Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `bets`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`
   - `i` is incremented by 1
   - `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i`, and `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `bets`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `i + 1` and check if it is still less than `bets`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `sumo` needs to be recalculated based on the new value of `i`. It will be the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < (i + 1)`, and then increased by `int(a[i + 1])`.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`.
- `sumo` is updated to include the new value of `a[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < (i + 1)` and increased by `int(a[i + 1])`**.
