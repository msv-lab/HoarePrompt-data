Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `mak` is `n - 1`
   - `i` is `len(pans)`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `s` is the input string '>'
   - `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `int(input())` is the only variable in the loop head, it is the only one that needs to be adjusted.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `mak` remains `n - 1`
   - `i` remains `len(pans)`
   - `n` remains greater than 0
   - `s` remains the input string '>'
   - `pans` remains a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `mak` is `n - 1`, `i` is `len(pans)`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
