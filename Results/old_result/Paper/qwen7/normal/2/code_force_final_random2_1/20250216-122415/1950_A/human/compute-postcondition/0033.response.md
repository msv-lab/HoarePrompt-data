Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `res` is 'none'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'none'` to the variable `res`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z`, while `res` is now set to `'none'`.
