The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1`, which is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n`, which is the length of the string `s1` and is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^5). The function does not directly return anything based on the parameters provided, but rather seems to process the string `s1` and might return a value depending on the internal logic. However, since no specific return conditions are given, we can only describe the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`.**
