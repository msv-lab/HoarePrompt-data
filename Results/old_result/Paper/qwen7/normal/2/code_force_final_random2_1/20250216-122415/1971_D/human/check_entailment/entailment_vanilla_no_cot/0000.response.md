Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Counting Pieces**: The logic to count the pieces is flawed. The current implementation increments `count` every time there is a change in consecutive characters. However, this approach doesn't account for the requirement that all zeros must come before all ones.

2. **Handling Sorted Strings**: The code does not handle strings that are already sorted correctly. For example, the string "00000000" should require only one piece, but the current logic would incorrectly count it as needing more pieces.

3. **Edge Cases**: The logic fails to handle edge cases properly. For instance, the string "111111" should also require only one piece, but the current logic might not handle it correctly.

### Correct Solution:
A correct approach would be to count the number of segments where the sequence changes from '0' to '1'. This is because each segment represents a potential piece that can be moved independently to form a sorted binary string.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        last_char = None
        
        for char in s:
            if char != last_char:
                count += 1
                last_char = char
        
        # If the last character is '0', we need one less piece
        if last_char == '0':
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
```

This solution works as follows:
- Iterate through the string and count the transitions from '0' to '1'.
- If the last character is '0', subtract one from the count since the entire string can be considered as one piece.
- Print the final count.

This approach ensures that the string is divided into the minimum number of pieces required to form a sorted binary string.
