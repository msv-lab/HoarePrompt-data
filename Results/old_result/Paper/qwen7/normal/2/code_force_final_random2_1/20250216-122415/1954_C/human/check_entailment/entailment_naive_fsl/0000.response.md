Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the lengths of `a` and `b` are different. According to the problem description, both `x` and `y` are of the same length, but the program does not check this condition. Additionally, the logic inside `func_1()` is flawed because it only swaps digits if `f` is 0 initially, which means it might not always perform the necessary swaps to maximize the product.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
123
456
```
The program will output:
```
456
123
```
However, the optimal solution would be to swap the digits such that the resulting numbers are `654` and `321`, which would yield a higher product. The current implementation does not guarantee this behavior.
