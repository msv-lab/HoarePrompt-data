Postcondition: **`y` is 3, `x` is `n - 1` where `n` must be at least 5, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`, `c` is 0, and the current value of `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. The difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.**
