Output State: **`k` is equal to `req` - 4, `i` is 3, `n` is defined and greater than 1, `ans2` contains the values of `c[1]` and `c[2]` and now also includes `c[3]`, and the value of `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` was initially equal to `req - 2`. After executing `k -= 2`, `k` is now equal to `req - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
