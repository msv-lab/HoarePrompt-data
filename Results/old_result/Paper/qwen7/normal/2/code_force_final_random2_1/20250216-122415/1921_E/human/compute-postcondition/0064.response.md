Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`.
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
- `y1` is either `r[3] + 1` or `r[3] - 1`.
- `y2` is either `1` or `m`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
- The condition `(b // 2 > a and abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c and (1 <= y1 <= m) and (1 <= x1 <= n))` is true.

The print statement is `print('Alice')`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string "Alice" because it is directly printing a string literal and does not depend on any of the other variables provided in the initial state.

Output: **Alice**
