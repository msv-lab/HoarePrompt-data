You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates 1000 sets of three random integers each, ranging from 1 to 9. For each set, it determines whether the integers form a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' pattern based on specific conditions. It prints each set of integers followed by the determined pattern. After completing 1000 iterations, the function ends with no return value, leaving the printed patterns and integers as the output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if three given digits form a "stair", "peak", or "none". The conditions for "stair" and "peak" are clearly defined.
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` generates random digits `x`, `y`, and `z` between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and prints them.
   - It then checks the conditions for "stair" and "peak" but does not match the actual problem requirements.
   - The logic inside the `if-else` block does not correctly implement the conditions for "stair" and "peak":
     - For "stair": `a < b < c`
     - For "peak": `a < b > c`
   - Instead, the program uses:
     - `x < y` to check for increasing order, which can be true for both "stair" and "peak".
     - If `x < y`, it further checks `y > z` for "peak" and `y < z` for "stair", which is incorrect.
     - If `x >= y`, it incorrectly sets the result to "none".

3. **Example Test Cases**:
   - The provided example test cases do not align with the logic implemented in the given program. The program will generate random numbers and print results based on incorrect logic.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
