Output State: **`a` is a non-empty array (at least one element); `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`; `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x.**

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This does not affect the values of `a` or `mod_y`, so they remain unchanged. The value of `required_mod_x` is determined by the given formula using the existing values of `x` and `mod_x`.
