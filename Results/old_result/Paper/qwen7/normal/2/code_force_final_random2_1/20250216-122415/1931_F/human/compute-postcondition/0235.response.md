Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. This means the loop continues as long as `i < n-1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 to become `k+2`.
   - `idx1` is equal to `i`.
   - `idx2` is either equal to `i` or remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `p1` and `p2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n-1`.
   - Given that `i` is now `k+2`, the loop will continue if `k+2 < n-1`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from `k+2` to `k+3`.
   - `idx1` will be set to `i`, which is `k+3`.
   - `idx2` can either be `k+3` (if it was `i` before) or remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `p1` and `p2` will remain unchanged.
   - `n` will remain greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is `k+3`, `idx1` is `k+3`, `idx2` is either `k+3` or remains the same, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, and `n` remains greater than 1**.
