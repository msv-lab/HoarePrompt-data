Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and iterates as long as `i < n`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is 1
   - `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `i` is 1
   - The input string is less than '<'

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true, so `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 2.
   - The other states (`mak`, `num_iterations`, and the input string) do not change because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`mak` is 1, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
