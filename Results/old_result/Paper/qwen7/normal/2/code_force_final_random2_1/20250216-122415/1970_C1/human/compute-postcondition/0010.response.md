Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree is represented by an empty deque `tree`. The first element of the deque `tree` is equal to `v`, and `u` and `v` are assigned the values from input split and converted to integers.
