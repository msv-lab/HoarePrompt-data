Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1 + a, `y1` is r[3] + 1, `x2` is r[4] - a, `y2` is 1, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The code `y2 = 1` updates the value of `y2` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Since `y2` is now 1, `t` is updated to the absolute difference between `y2` (which is 1) and `y1` (which is `r[3] + 1`). However, the exact value of `t` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `y1`, but it is stated that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `y1` is not equal to `y2` (which is now 1).
