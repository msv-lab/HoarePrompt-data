Output State: **`i` is `k-2`, `k - 1` must be a positive integer, `t` is \(2^{(k-2)} \mod \text{MOD}\), `ans` is the sum of all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{(k-2)}\) modulo `MOD`, `T` is `T-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()`. It does not modify the existing variables `i`, `k - 1`, `t`, `ans`, and `T`, but introduces two new variables `n` and `k` which are assigned the values read from the input. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
