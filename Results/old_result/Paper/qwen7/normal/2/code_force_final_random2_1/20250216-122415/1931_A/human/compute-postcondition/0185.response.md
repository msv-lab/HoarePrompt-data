Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(3):`. The variables involved in this loop are `j`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 7
   - `cases` must be greater than 0
   - `temp` is equal to `chr(info[6][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][3] + 96)`
   - `j` is 3

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 4 (since it was 3 in the previous iteration).
   - The other variables (`i`, `cases`, and `temp`) are not affected by the loop and remain the same.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` remains 7.
   - `cases` must still be greater than 0.
   - `temp` remains `chr(info[6][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][3] + 96)`.
   - `j` changes to 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 7, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[6][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][3] + 96)`, `j` is 4**
