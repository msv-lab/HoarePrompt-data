Output State: **i is n-1, zero is the count of '0' characters in the string s, one is the count of '1' characters in the string s, zero_perc is 50, one_perc is 50, and lst contains all indices from 1 to n (inclusive) where the percentage of zeros up to that index is at least 50 and the percentage of ones from that index to the end is at least 50.**

In this final state, the variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`. The variables `zero` and `one` will hold the counts of '0' and '1' characters in the string `s`, respectively. The `zero_perc` and `one_perc` will both be 50 because they are calculated using the total counts of zeros and ones, which will result in exactly 50% for both when considering the entire string. The list `lst` will contain all indices from 1 to `n` where the condition `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` is satisfied, which means it will include indices where the cumulative percentage of zeros up to that point and the remaining percentage of ones from that point to the end meet the criteria.
