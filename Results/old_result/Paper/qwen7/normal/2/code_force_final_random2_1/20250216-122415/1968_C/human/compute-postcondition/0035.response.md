Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is set to `t - 1`, but since `t` is not explicitly defined elsewhere, we cannot determine its exact value. However, it does not affect the `print(result)` statement directly.
- `result` is explicitly stated to be `'1000'`.
- `n` is mentioned to be at least 2 but does not affect the `print(result)` statement.
- `line` and `T` are not relevant to the `print(result)` statement.
- `a` is a list starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each computed as the previous element minus the corresponding value in `T`. However, since `T` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact elements of `a`. But `result` is the string representation of the list `a` joined by spaces.
- `result` is explicitly stated to be `'1000'`.

Therefore, the `print(result)` statement will simply print the string `'1000'`.

Output: **1000**
