Output State: **`op` is now the result of `val` >> `i` & 1 ^ (`val` >> `i` & 1), `a` is a list with at least two elements, `ai` is 0, `val` remains unchanged, `t` is a list containing the elements 0, 0, 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `ai` to 0, which updates the value of `ai`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
