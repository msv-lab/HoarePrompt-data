#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')

    #State: Output State: `i` is 1001, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' based on the conditions of the if and else blocks.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to 1000. After the loop completes its 1000th iteration (when `i` becomes 1001), the loop terminates. At this point, `i` will be 1001, and `x`, `y`, `z`, and `res` will retain their most recent values from the last iteration of the loop, which are still random integers between 1 and 9, and a value of 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' respectively, determined by the conditions in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates 1000 sets of three random integers each, ranging from 1 to 9. For each set, it determines whether the integers form a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' pattern based on specific conditions. It prints each set of integers followed by the determined pattern. After completing 1000 iterations, the function ends with no return value, leaving the printed patterns and integers as the output.
