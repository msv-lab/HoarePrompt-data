Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration, after the first iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Given that `j` is currently 0 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again as long as `n` remains greater than 0.

5. **Final State**:
   - `j` will be 1 after the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**.
