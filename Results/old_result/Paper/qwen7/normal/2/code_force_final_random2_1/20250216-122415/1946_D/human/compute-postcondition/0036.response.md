Output State: **`a` is the same list, `val` is the next element in `a`, `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> 1 & 1`, `ai` is 0, `t` is [0, 0, 0]**.

Explanation: The code sets `ai` to 0. Since `ai` was previously `ai ^ val`, setting `ai` to 0 implies that `ai` is now 0 (as `ai ^ val ^ val` equals 0). The other variables (`a`, `val`, `op`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
