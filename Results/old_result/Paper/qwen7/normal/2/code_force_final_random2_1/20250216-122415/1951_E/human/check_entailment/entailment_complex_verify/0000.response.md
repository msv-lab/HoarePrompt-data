### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Helper Functions (`func_1` and `func_2`)**:
   - `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing the first half with the reversed second half.
   - `func_2` attempts to classify the length of a string based on whether the first half is a palindrome. It returns one of four values (1, 2, 3, or 4).

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.
   - It initializes flags `T1` and `T2` to `True`, and a counter `a` to `0`.
   - It checks if `s` is a single repeated character (e.g., "aaaaa"). If so, it sets `T1` to `False`.
   - It uses `func_1` to check if `s` is a palindrome. If `s` is a palindrome, it sets `T1` to `False`.
   - It uses `func_2` to get a value `a` which determines how to partition `s`.
     - If `a` is `0`, it means `s` cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, so it prints "NO".
     - If `a` is `1`, it splits `s` into two parts at the midpoint.
     - If `a` is `2`, it tries to split `s` into three parts, checking each part for non-palindromicity.
     - If `a` is `3` or `4`, it splits `s` into two parts, similar to `a=1`.

3. **Partitioning Logic**:
   - The logic for splitting `s` into non-palindromic substrings is somewhat convoluted and does not guarantee that the resulting substrings are non-palindromic.
   - The main issue is that the logic for determining `a` and splitting `s` is not robust enough to ensure that the resulting substrings are non-palindromic.

Given the above analysis, the code does not correctly solve the problem because:
- It does not ensure that the resulting substrings are non-palindromic.
- The logic for determining `a` and splitting `s` is flawed and may not always produce a valid partition.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
