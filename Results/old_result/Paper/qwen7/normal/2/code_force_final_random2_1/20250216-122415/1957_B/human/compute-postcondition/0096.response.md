Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the context it was placed in, which could be an implicit loop or conditional structure. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
