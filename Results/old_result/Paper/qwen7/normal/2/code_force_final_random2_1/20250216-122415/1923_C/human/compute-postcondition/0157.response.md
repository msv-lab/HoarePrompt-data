Postcondition: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, otherwise `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`, and `s` is decreased by `p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`.**

Explanation: The postcondition remains unchanged because both the if and else parts of the if-else block do not alter the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `m`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `s` beyond what is already specified in the precondition and the postconditions of each part. Specifically, the if and else parts both ensure that `s` is computed as described and that no additional changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the overall postcondition is the same as the postcondition for both the if and else parts.
