Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `t` is equal to the integer input.
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < t`.
4. **Initial value of `i`**: By default, `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `t`. Since `i` starts at 0, the condition `i < t` will be true if `t` is greater than 0. However, since `t` is constrained to be between 1 and 100, this condition is always satisfied.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is within its valid range (which it already is based on the problem statement).

**Final State**:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).

However, to explicitly state what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we can say:

**State**: **`t` must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**.

Since `t` is already within the specified range, the adjustment needed is simply ensuring `t` is greater than 0, which it inherently is due to the constraints given.

**State**: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

This ensures the loop can start executing.
