Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `no`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `no`. The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, we know that if the current value of `i` meets certain conditions, `num` is decremented.

3. **Determine the initial state**: We need to consider the state at the end of the previous iteration. The postcondition tells us that `no` must contain at least one element. However, the specific values of `i` and `num` are not provided in the state at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `no`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `no`.
   - The list `no` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given this information, we can conclude that at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be the next element in the list `no`.
- `no` must still contain at least one element.

Since the exact values of `i` and `num` are not specified in the state at the end of the previous iteration, we cannot provide specific values for them. However, we can state the necessary conditions for the loop to continue.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`no` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in the list `no`**
