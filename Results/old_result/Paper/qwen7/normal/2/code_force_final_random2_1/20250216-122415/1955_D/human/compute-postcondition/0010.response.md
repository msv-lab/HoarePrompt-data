Output State: **`E` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements that are present in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`; `D` remains unchanged; `cnt_aa` remains unchanged; `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_bb`, and `pairs_in_D` remain unchanged; `C` is a Counter object representing `cnt_bb - D`.**

Explanation: The code `C = cnt_bb - D` creates a new Counter object `C` that represents the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`. This means that `C` will contain the counts of elements that are present in `cnt_bb` but not in `D`. The other variables (`E`, `D`, `cnt_aa`, `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_bb`, and `pairs_in_D`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
