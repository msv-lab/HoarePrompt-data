Output State: **`new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`; `b[ma]` is increased by 1; `op` is increased by 1.**

The code `op += 1` increments the value of `op` by 1. Since `op` was not given an initial value in the initial state, it is assumed to be 0 before this operation. After executing the code, `op` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
