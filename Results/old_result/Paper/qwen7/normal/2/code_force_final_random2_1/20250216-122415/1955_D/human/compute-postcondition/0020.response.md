Output State: **Postcondition: `aa` must have at least `n` elements, `m` must be less than `n`, `n - m` must be greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` must be less than or equal to 0, and the current value of `D[out_aa]` is now greater than 0 - 1.**

Explanation: The code `D[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `D[out_aa]` by 1. Since the initial condition stated that `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, after executing the code, `D[out_aa]` will be greater than 0 - 1, which means `D[out_aa]` is now greater than -1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
