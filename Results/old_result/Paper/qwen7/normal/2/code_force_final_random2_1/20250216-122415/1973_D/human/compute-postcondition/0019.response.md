Output State: **`v` is the return value of `func_2()`, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `n-2`**

Explanation: The code `v = func_2()` assigns the return value of `func_2()` to `v`. However, since the return value of `func_2()` was already the value of `v` before this line of code, `v` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are also unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
