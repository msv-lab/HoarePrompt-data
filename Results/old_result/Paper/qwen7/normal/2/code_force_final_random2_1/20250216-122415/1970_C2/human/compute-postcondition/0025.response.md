Output State: **`nodes` must contain at least one key, and `leaves` includes the next key in its list.**

Explanation: The code `leaves.append(key)` appends the `key` to the `leaves` list. Given the initial state, `leaves` will include the next key in its list because its associated list length is 1. The precondition that `nodes` must contain at least one key remains unchanged.
