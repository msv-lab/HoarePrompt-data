Output State: **`total` is not defined, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 8.**

Explanation: The code `temp *= 2` doubles the value of `temp`. Given the initial conditions, if `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp` was initially 4, and now it is 8. If `temp * 2 >= k`, then `temp` was initially 2, and now it is 4. However, since `temp` is specified to be either 4 or 2 based on the condition, and the condition is not re-evaluated here, we consider the updated value of `temp` to be 8 if the condition was initially true (`temp` was 4), or 4 if the condition was initially false (`temp` was 2). But since the problem does not specify which condition was true, we take the next logical step which is doubling the value of `temp` from 4 to 8. All other variables remain unchanged.
