Postcondition: `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; if `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid` + 1, and `high` remains unchanged; otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid` - 1, and `low` remains unchanged; `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
