Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of \( n \) within the specified range. The program only handles specific values of \( n \) (1, 2, 3, and 4) and prints hardcoded patterns for these values. For any other value of \( n \), it simply prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish). This approach fails to generate the correct checkerboard pattern for any \( n \) outside the hardcoded values.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should dynamically generate the checkerboard pattern for any \( n \) within the range 1 to 20. Here's how it can be done:

1. For each row, alternate between printing two '#' characters followed by two '.' characters.
2. Repeat this pattern for \( 2n \) rows.

This approach ensures that the checkerboard pattern is generated correctly for any \( n \) within the specified range.

Correctness: **False**
