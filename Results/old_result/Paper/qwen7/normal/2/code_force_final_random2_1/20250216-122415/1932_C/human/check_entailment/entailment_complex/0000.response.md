Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly describes the steps required to solve the problem:
   - It reads the input values and initializes the necessary variables.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
   - The function `func_1` processes the commands and constructs the list `b` based on the instructions in `s`.
   - It then calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and appends these products to the list `ans`.

2. The function `func_1`:
   - Constructs the list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the instructions in `s`.
   - Calculates the product of all elements in `b` and stores these products in reverse order in the list `ans`.

3. The logic in `func_1`:
   - Iterates through the string `s` and appends elements from `a` to `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - Reverses the order of the elements in `b` before calculating the product.
   - Calculates the product of the elements in `b` and appends the results to `ans` in reverse order.

4. The overall flow of the program matches the problem description and the expected behavior:
   - It processes each command in the order specified by `s`.
   - It outputs the remainder of the product of the current state of the array `a` when divided by `m` before removing an element based on the command.

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
