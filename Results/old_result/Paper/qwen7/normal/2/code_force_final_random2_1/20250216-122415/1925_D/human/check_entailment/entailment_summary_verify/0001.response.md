### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values. Let's break down why the current implementation is incorrect and what the correct approach should be:

1. **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The current implementation calculates a simple linear combination of the friendship values and the number of pairs, which does not account for the probabilistic nature of the problem. Specifically, it does not consider the probability of picking each pair and how the friendship values change over the excursions.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. For each pair of friends, the expected increase in the friendship value per excursion is \(\frac{k}{\text{number of pairs}}\). This is because each pair is chosen equiprobably and independently.
   - The expected value for each pair of friends after \(k\) excursions is \(f_i \cdot \frac{k}{\text{number of pairs}}\).
   - Summing these expected values for all pairs of friends gives us the total expected value.

3. **Correct Formula:**
   - Let \(E\) be the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - \(E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}\) is the total number of unique pairs.
   - Simplifying, \(E = \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i\).

4. **Implementation:**
   - The program should calculate the sum of friendship values and then multiply it by \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Finally, it should reduce the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation, and the correct approach involves a different formula and logic.
