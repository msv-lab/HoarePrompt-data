Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `ans` is `False` if any of the conditions to update `arr[i - 1]` were met during the loop's execution; otherwise, `ans` remains `True`.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns them to the list `arr`. The variable `m` remains unchanged as it was an input integer. The variable `i` remains 1 because the code does not modify it. The variable `ans` remains `False` if any of the conditions to update `arr[i - 1]` were met during the loop's execution; otherwise, it remains `True`. Since no conditions to update `arr[i - 1]` are specified in the given code, `ans` remains `True` unless explicitly updated elsewhere.
