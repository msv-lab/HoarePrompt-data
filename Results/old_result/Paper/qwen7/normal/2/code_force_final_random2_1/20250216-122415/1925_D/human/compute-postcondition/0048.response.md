Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The initial state of `j` and `m` remains unchanged. Therefore, `j` is still 0 and `m` must still be greater than 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are the integers input by the user.
