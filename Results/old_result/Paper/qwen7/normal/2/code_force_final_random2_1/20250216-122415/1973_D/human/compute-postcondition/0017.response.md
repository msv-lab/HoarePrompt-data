Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` down to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v` is the return value of `func_2()`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `k` is the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, `i` will be `n-2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The values of `v` and `k` remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they stay the same.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop is `v == n`. Since `v` did not equal `n` in the previous iteration, it remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `n-2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - `k` remains the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `v` remains the return value of `func_2()`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`v` is the return value of `func_2()`, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `n-2`**.
