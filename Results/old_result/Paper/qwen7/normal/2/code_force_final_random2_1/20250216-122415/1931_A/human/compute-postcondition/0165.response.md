Output State: `i` is 3, `cases` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[3][2] + 96`, `info[2][2] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96` in that order.

Explanation: The loop runs for 3 iterations as specified by the `range(3)` in the `for` loop. After all iterations, the variable `i` will have the value 3 (since it starts at 0 and increments by the implicit step of 1 for each iteration), `j` will have the value 2 (as it goes from 0 to 2), and `temp` will contain the concatenated string of characters derived from `info[3][2] + 96`, `info[2][2] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`. The conditions for `cases > 0` and `temp` being an empty string initially still hold true.
