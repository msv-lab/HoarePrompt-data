Output State: **`pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1; `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by 1; `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`**

Explanation: 
- `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `C[out_aa] + 1`.
- The other variables (`pairs_in_D`, `fnd`, `D[out_aa]`, `C[in_aa]`, `E[in_aa]`, `in_aa`, and `out_aa`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
