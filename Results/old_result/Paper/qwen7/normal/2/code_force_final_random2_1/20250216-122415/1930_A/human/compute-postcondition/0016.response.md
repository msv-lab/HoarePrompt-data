Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` has at least one less element, `suma` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of the original `numbers` plus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `a` is the first element of the original `numbers`, `b` is the value of the element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is now stored in `b` and is the first element of the original `numbers`.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and assigns its integer value to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` is now the first element of the original `numbers` list.
