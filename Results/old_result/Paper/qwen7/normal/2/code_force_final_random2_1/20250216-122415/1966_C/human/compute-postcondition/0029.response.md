Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` remains as the smallest positive integer not present in `a`, `tc` is equal to the previous value of `tc` + 1, `n` is an input integer, a new list `a` is created by mapping integers from input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This new list replaces the existing `a`, which was initially a sorted list of integers. The values of `mexsize`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states.
