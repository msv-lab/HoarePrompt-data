Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the following variables: `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop iterates over the tuples formed by `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`. This means the loop will continue as long as there are enough elements in `a` to form such tuples.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` must have at least 4 elements.
   - `b` is updated based on certain conditions involving `v`, `x`, `y`, `z`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 5 elements because the loop requires 4 elements to form the tuple `(w, x, y, z)`.
   - The values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the next set of consecutive elements from `a`.

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- `a` must have at least 5 elements.
- `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the next set of consecutive elements from `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` must have at least 5 elements, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the next set of consecutive elements from `a`**.
