Output State: The list `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` will be calculated based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically:

- For `i = 0`, the first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For subsequent iterations, each element in `ans` will be the cumulative sum according to the rules inside the loop:
  - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the next element in `ans` is the previous element plus `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
  - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the next element in `ans` is the previous element plus `a[i - 1]`.

In summary, `ans` will contain the sequence of sums generated by the loop, starting from the initial sum and updating it based on the specified conditions until all iterations are completed.
