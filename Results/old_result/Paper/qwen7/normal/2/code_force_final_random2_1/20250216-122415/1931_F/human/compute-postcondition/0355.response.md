Output State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `p1`, `p2`, or `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional was mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the context it was given. The preconditions remain valid except for the fact that the execution has broken out of the loop or conditional.
