Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements of the `results` list using the variable `r`.
   - Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `r` and `results`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` is a list containing at least one element.
   - `r` takes the value of an element from the `results` list.

3. **Understand the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one element left in the `results` list.
   - After each iteration, `r` takes the value of the current element, and the list `results` is updated (usually by removing the processed element).

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `r` takes the value of an element from `results`, it will change with each iteration.
   - The list `results` will have one less element after each iteration if the element is removed.

Given that `results` contains at least one element at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element, and `r` will take the value of the next element in the list.

**Step-by-Step Adjustment:**
- At the end of the previous iteration, `results` contains at least one element.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.
- `r` will take the value of the next element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `results` must contain at least two elements (since one element was just processed).
- `r` will take the value of the next element in the list.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` is a list containing at least two elements, `r` will take the value of the next element in the list**
