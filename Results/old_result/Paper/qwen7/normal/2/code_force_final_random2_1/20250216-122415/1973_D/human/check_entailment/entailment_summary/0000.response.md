Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Reads and returns a list of integers for each test case, which includes `t`, `n`, and `k`.
   - **func_2**: Reads and returns an integer input from the standard input.
   - **func_3**: Reads and returns a tuple of four integers: `t`, `n`, `k`, and `r`.
   - **func_4**: Reads and returns a string input from the standard input, stripping any trailing whitespace.
   - **func_5**: This function is the main logic function that interacts with the problem's requirements.

2. **func_5 Behavior**:
   - It first calculates the maximum possible value `v` by querying the function `f(l, r)` for different values of `r` starting from `n` down to `1`.
   - Then, it tries to split the array into `k` subarrays such that the product of the length and the maximum value in each subarray equals `v`.
   - It uses a nested loop to check if such a split is possible. If it finds a valid split, it prints the result and exits. If not, it prints `-1`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_5` seems to follow the problem's requirements correctly. It first determines the maximum possible value `v` by querying the function `f(l, r)` for different values of `r`. This part ensures that `v` is calculated correctly.
   - Then, it attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays with the product of their length and maximum value equal to `v`. The logic inside the nested loops seems to correctly implement the required checks.
   - The function handles both the case where a valid split is found and the case where no valid split exists.

Given the analysis, the provided functions seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
