Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is an input integer.
- `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, and `moves` is explicitly stated to be `False`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('Hermione')
```

This print statement will output the string `'Hermione'` regardless of the values of `start` and `moves`.

Output: **Hermione**
