You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durabilities of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes `n`, `k`, and the list `a` as parameters.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to track the first and last ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to count the number of ships that sink.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The function uses a while loop to simulate the attacks until `k` is zero or all ships are sunk.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `l` and `r` are the same. If so, it handles the special case where there is only one ship left.
   - If the durabilities of the ships at `l` and `r` are equal, it checks how many attacks can be made before either ship sinks.
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the ship at `l`, it simulates sinking both ships and adjusts the remaining attacks and the list `a`.
     - If `k` is exactly `a[l] * 2 - 1`, it simulates sinking the ship at `l` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the durabilities of the ships at `l` and `r` are different, it follows a similar logic but swaps the roles of `l` and `r` based on which ship has higher durability.
   - The loop continues until `k` is zero or all ships are sunk.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's check the example provided in the problem statement with the given input:

#### Example Input:
```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

#### Expected Output:
```
2
```

#### Execution:
1. Initial Durabilities: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`
2. First Attack (l = 0, r = 3): Sunk ship 1, Durabilities: `[2, 4, 3]`
3. Second Attack (l = 0, r = 2): Sunk ship 3, Durabilities: `[2, 4, 2]`
4. Third Attack (l = 0, r = 1): Sunk ship 1, Durabilities: `[1, 4, 2]`
5. Fourth Attack (l = 0, r = 1): Sunk ship 1, Durabilities: `[4, 2]`

After 4 attacks, 2 ships are sunk. The program correctly handles this scenario.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately simulates the attacks and counts the number of ships that sink.
