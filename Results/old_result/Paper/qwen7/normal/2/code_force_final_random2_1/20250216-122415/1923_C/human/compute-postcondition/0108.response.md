Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers. It then assigns the first input to `n` and the second input to `m`. Since `m` was initially 1, it remains unchanged unless explicitly modified by subsequent code. The values of `a` and `b` remain as the most recent inputs because they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `a` and `b` are considered as the most recent inputs, which are now represented as `a` is an input integer and `b` is an input integer. The value of `m` remains 1, and `n` is set to the value of the first input.
