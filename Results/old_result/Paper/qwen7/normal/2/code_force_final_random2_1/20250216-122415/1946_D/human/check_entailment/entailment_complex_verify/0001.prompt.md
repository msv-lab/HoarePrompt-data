You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

    2
    
Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` and an integer `x`. It iterates over the bits of `x` and compares them with the corresponding bits of the integers in `a`. Based on these comparisons, it updates a counter `ans` which tracks the maximum number of times a specific condition is met during the iterations. Finally, it returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. If no valid operations are performed, it returns -1.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `n`.

2. **XOR and OR Operations:**
   - The program iterates over bits from 29 down to 0.
   - For each bit position `i`, it checks if the bit in `x` is set (`u`) and the sum of the corresponding bits in the array `a` is even (`v`).
   - If both `u` and `v` are zero, it continues to the next bit.
   - If `u` is zero and `v` is odd, it returns `-1` because no valid segments can be formed.
   - If `u` is zero and `v` is even, it processes the array to find segments where the XOR of the segment matches the required condition.
   - If `u` is one and `v` is odd, it skips to the next iteration.
   - If `u` is one and `v` is even, it counts the number of valid segments for this bit.
   - If `u` is one and `v` is zero, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Segment Processing:**
   - When `u` is zero and `v` is even, it processes the array to find segments where the XOR of the segment matches the required condition.
   - It uses a temporary list `t` to store these segments.
   - It iterates through the array, maintaining a running XOR and a running value `ai`.
   - When the running XOR becomes zero, it adds `ai` to the list `t` and resets `ai`.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - After processing all bits, it returns the maximum count of segments found.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `3 1 1 2 3`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Segments `[1, 1]` and `[2, 3]` have XOR values `1` and `1` respectively, and their OR is `1`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2 2 1 1`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Segments `[1, 1]` and `[2, 2]` have XOR values `1` and `1` respectively, and their OR is `1`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `2 2 1 3`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Only segment `[1, 1]` has XOR value `1`, which is less than or equal to `2`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `2 3 0 0`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Segments `[1, 1]` and `[2, 2]` have XOR values `0` and `0` respectively, and their OR is `0`.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `3 2 0 0 1`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Segments `[1, 1]`, `[2, 2]`, and `[3, 3]` have XOR values `0`, `0`, and `1` respectively, and their OR is `1`.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `4 2 1 3 3 7`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Segments `[1, 1]` and `[3, 4]` have XOR values `1` and `0` respectively, and their OR is `1`.

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `2 2 2 3`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Only segment `[1, 1]` has XOR value `2`, which is less than or equal to `2`.

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - Input: `5 0 0 1 2 2 1`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Segments `[1, 2]` and `[4, 5]` have XOR values `1` and `1` respectively, and their OR is `1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of segments such that the OR of their XOR values is less than or equal to `x`. It handles all given test cases correctly.
