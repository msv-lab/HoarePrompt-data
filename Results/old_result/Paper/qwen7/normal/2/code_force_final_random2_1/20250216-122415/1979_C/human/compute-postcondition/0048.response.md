Output State: **`prod` is `a[0] * a[2] * a[4]`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of the integer values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The line `prod *= a[i]` multiplies the current value of `prod` by `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 4, `prod` is updated to `a[0] * a[2] * a[4]`. The other variables (`sumo` and `bets`) remain unchanged from their initial state, and `i` remains 4 as no operation changes its value.
