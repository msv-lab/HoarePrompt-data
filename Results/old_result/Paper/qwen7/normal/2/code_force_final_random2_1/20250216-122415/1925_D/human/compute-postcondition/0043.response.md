Based on the initial state provided:

- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over all iterations.
- `j` is equal to `m`.
- `f` is the last integer from the input in the final iteration.
- `a` is the first integer from the input in the final iteration.
- `b` is the second integer from the input in the final iteration.
- `p` is equal to `p // gcd`.
- `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `q` is equal to `q // gcd`.

We need to evaluate the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **GCD Calculation**: `p` and `q` are divided by their GCD, so `p` and `q` are now coprime (their GCD is 1).
2. **Modular Inverse**: `pow(q, -1, M)` computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`. This means it finds an integer `q_inv` such that `(q * q_inv) % M == 1`.
3. **Multiplication and Modulo**: The expression `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M` multiplies `p` by the modular inverse of `q` and then takes the result modulo `M`.

Given that `p` and `q` are coprime, the modular inverse of `q` exists, and the expression simplifies to finding the modular inverse of `q` and then multiplying it by `p` and taking the result modulo `M`.

Therefore, the output of the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` will be an integer between 0 and `M-1`.

Output: **int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)**
