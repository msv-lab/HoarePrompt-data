Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range 1 to \(n\), `l` is now `r-3`, `r` is now `n-3`, `sunks` is increased by 1, `k` is decreased by either `2 * a[l]` (if `a[r] == 0`) or `2 * a[l] + 2 * a[r]` (if `a[r] != 0`), `a[r]` is reduced by `a[l]` if `a[r] == 0` or by `a[l] + a[l]` if `a[r] != 0`, `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` simply increments the value of `sunks` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
