Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n // k + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial values**:
   - `v` is the return value of `func_2()` after the last iteration.
   - `n` is 1 (since the loop decrements `i` from `n` to 1).
   - `k` is the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `i` is 0 (as the loop runs until `i` reaches 1 and then decrements again).

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n // k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop runs until `i` reaches 1, `i` must be 0 for the loop to start.
   - `n` is already given as 1.
   - `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, and we need to ensure that `n // k + 1` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, let's determine the necessary adjustments:

- `i` must be 0.
- `n` must be 1.
- `k` must be such that `1 // k + 1` is at least 1. This means `k` must be greater than 0 because if `k` were 0 or negative, the expression `1 // k + 1` would not be valid or would result in an error.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `i` is 0, `n` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0**
