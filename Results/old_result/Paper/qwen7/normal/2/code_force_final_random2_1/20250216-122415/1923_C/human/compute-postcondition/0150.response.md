Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`. After the code, `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by space.**

The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by space, and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
