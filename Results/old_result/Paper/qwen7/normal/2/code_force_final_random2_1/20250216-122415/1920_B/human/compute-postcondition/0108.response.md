Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[0 - 1] - 2 * a[0 + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `i - 1` is -1 and `i + x - 1` simplifies to `x - 1`. Therefore, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[-1] - 2 * a[x - 1]`. However, since `a[-1]` is not defined in the given context, we keep it as `a[-1]` in the output state. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
