Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`
   - `k` is reduced by `s`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, which means `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`).
   - `s` remains the same because it is only updated when `k` is reduced by `s`, and this happens outside the loop.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `c` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` must still be greater than `i + 1` (which is now `i + 2`).
- `s` remains the same.
- `k` is reduced by `s`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`c` is `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is reduced by `s`**
