Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the current value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the length of `suffZero` minus 1 to `zr`. Since `totalOne` and `suffZero` are unchanged, their previous values remain valid. The other variables (`s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, `ans`, `i`, `el`) are also unchanged.
