Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `len(l)` must be at least `n + 2`, `ans2` contains the elements `l[n + 1]` and `l[i]`, `ans1` appends the element `l[n + 1]` to itself and contains the elements `l[n + 1]` and `l[i]`**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is `n + 2`, `ans2` now contains the elements `l[n + 1]` and `l[n + 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
