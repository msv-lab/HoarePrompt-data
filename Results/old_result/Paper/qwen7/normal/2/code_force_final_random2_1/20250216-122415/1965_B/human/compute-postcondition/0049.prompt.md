Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is -1, `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) plus \((1 << 20)\), \((1 << 21)\), and \((1 << 22)\), `i` is equal to 21.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] > k:
        idx = i - 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 21, `nums[i]` is compared with `k`. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no change to `idx` in the else part since there is no else part provided.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 21. If `nums[21]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is set to 20 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `nums[21]` is not greater than `k`, then no changes are made to `idx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 22, `nums[i]` is either greater than `k` or does not satisfy the condition to enter the if block, and `idx` is 21, indicating that the most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
