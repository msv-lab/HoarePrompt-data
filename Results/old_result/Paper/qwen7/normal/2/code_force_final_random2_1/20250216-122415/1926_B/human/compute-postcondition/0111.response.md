Postcondition: `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is either 'SQUARE' (if any of the input strings contain more than one '1') or remains unchanged (if all input strings contain exactly one '1'), and `s` is updated to the new input string after the last iteration. The current value of `a` is not 0.
