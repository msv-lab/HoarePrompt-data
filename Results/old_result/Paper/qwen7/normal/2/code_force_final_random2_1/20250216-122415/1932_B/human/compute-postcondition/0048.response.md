Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. For every index `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `dp[j]` is set as follows:
- If `path[j]` is '*', then `dp[j]` is `-float('inf')`.
- If `path[j]` is '@', then `dp[j]` is the maximum of `dp[j-1]` and `dp[j-2]` plus 1.
- If `path[j]` is '*', and `path[j+1]` is '@', then `dp[j]` is the maximum of `dp[j-1]` and `dp[j-2]`.

All other variables remain in their initial or updated states according to the loop's execution.**

This means that after the loop completes, the `dp` list will have been updated based on the conditions specified within the loop, with each element reflecting the maximum path sum up to that point under the given constraints.
