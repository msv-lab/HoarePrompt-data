Output State: **`t` is 1, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer equal to the second element of `info`, `suma` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `suma` to 0. No other variables are affected, and the conditions or values of the initial state remain unchanged.
