Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`testCases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password (`length`) and the password itself (`password`).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is responsible for checking if the password meets the specified conditions.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters` to store the digits and letters from the password, respectively.
   - It iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - Otherwise, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - After collecting the digits and letters, it sorts both lists.
   - It then checks if any digit is greater than the next digit (to ensure digits are in non-decreasing order).
   - It also checks if any digit is greater than any letter (to ensure no digit comes after a letter).
   - Finally, it constructs a sorted password by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` and compares it with the original password. If they match, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Verification:

1. **Condition 1: Password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.**
   - The program correctly separates digits and letters and does not directly check this condition. However, since the problem assumes valid inputs, we can assume this condition is met.

2. **Condition 2: No digit comes after a letter.**
   - The program checks if any digit is greater than the next digit and if any digit is greater than any letter. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

3. **Condition 3: All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.**
   - The program sorts the `digits` list and checks if any digit is out of order.

4. **Condition 4: All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.**
   - The program sorts the `letters` list and implicitly checks if they are in order by comparing them with the original password.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
