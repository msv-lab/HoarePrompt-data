Output State: **`i` is 2, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]`, `bets` must be greater than 1, `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` becomes `prod // a[2]`. The other variables (`sumo`, `bets`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
