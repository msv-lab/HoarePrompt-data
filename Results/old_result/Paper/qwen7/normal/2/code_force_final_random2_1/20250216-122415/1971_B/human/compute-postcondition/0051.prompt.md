Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    if len(s) == 1:
        print('No')
    elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
        print('No')
    else:
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s == s2:
            s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the next input from `input()` and is a positive integer within this range. If the length of `s` is equal to 1, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the string `s` does not have all characters the same or its length is not greater than 1, `s` is modified by moving the first character of `s` to the end of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 999\); `s` is the next input from `input()` and is a positive integer within this range, now `s` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user, and if the length of `s` is 1, `s` remains unchanged; otherwise, `s` is rotated by one character to the left.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 999\); `s` is a positive integer within this range, and if the length of `s` is 1, `s` remains unchanged; otherwise, `s` is either rotated by one character to the left or permuted randomly, but `s2` (the result of the operation) equals `s` if and only if `s` is rotated by one character to the left.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
