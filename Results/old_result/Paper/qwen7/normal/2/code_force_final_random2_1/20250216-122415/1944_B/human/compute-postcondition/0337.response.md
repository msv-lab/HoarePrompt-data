Output State: **`k` is equal to `req` - 4, `i` is 5, `n` is greater than 1, `ans2` contains the values of `c[1]`, `c[2]`, `c[3]`, and `c[4]`, and the value of `c[5]` is equal to the value of `c[4]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` was initially 4, after executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1 (since lists are zero-indexed, `c[i]` now refers to `c[5]`). The value of `c[5]` is set to the value of `c[4]` because the condition `k == 0` does not apply here, meaning the most internal loop or if statement is not broken out of. Therefore, `ans2` now contains the values of `c[1]`, `c[2]`, `c[3]`, and `c[4]`, and `c[5]` is equal to `c[4]`.
