Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 3`, `min(n, m)` must be at least 3**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it, where `b` is defined as `min(n, m) + 3`. Since the initial values of `n` and `m` are not specified, `b` is `min(n, m) + 3`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n`, `m`, and `ans` are updated according to the given formula.
