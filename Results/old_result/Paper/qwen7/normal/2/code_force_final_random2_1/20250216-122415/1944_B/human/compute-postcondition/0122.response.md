Output State: **`k` is -2, `ans1` is a list including `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[i_prev+1]`, and `l[i]`, `ans2` is a list including `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[i_prev+1]`, `l[i]` is appended to `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code appends `l[i]` to `ans2`. Given the initial state, `ans2` initially includes `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[i_prev+1]`. After appending `l[i]` to `ans2`, `ans2` now includes `l[0]`, `l[1]`, `l[i_prev+1]`, and `l[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
