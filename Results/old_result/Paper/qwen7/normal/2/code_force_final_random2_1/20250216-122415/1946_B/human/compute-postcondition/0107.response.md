Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `tmp` is the maximum of `tmp` and `t` plus `x`.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by `x`. The initial state tells us that `a` is a non-empty list of integers, and `tmp` is equal to the maximum of `tmp` and `t`. After executing the code, `tmp` is updated to its original value plus `x`. The state of `a` remains unchanged.
