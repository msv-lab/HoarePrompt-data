Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`.**

In this scenario, the code assigns the value of `data[index]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` being a positive integer is not affected by this operation, so it remains unchanged. The only new information is that `n` now holds the integer value from `data[index]`.
