Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, `s` is the new input string, and `pans` is a list containing the element `i`. If `s` equals `'<'`, then `i` is the length of `pans` + 1; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.
