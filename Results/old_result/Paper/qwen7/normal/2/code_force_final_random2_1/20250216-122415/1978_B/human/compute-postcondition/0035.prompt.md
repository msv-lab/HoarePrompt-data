You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of buns, a is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2(n, a, b):
    low, high = 0, min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `max_profit` is the highest profit obtained during any iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `low` will be exactly one more than `high`, indicating that the binary search has completed. The variable `mid` will hold the last midpoint value considered in the search, and `profit_mid` and `profit_next` will be the profits calculated for `mid` and `mid + 1` respectively in the last iteration. However, since the loop condition `low <= high` ensures that the search continues until `low` exceeds `high`, the exact values of `profit_mid` and `profit_next` in the last iteration are not specified but are used to update `max_profit`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `max_profit` will contain the highest profit found throughout the entire binary search process, and the search range will no longer satisfy the condition `low <= high`.
    return max_profit
    #The program returns the highest profit obtained during the binary search process.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. The function returns the highest profit obtained during the binary search process.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the highest profit obtained during the binary search process.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
