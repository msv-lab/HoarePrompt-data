Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of sorted integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `s` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
