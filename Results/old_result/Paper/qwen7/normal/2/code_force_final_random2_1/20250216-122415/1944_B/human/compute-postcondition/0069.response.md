Output State: **`k` is `req`, all elements in `ans1` are duplicates of consecutive elements in `b` until `k` reaches 0 or the end of the list `b` is reached, `ans2` remains empty, the list `l` contains the first element of `b` and any elements of `b` that are not equal to their preceding or succeeding elements, unless `k` becomes 0 before processing all elements.**

Explanation: The code `k = req` simply assigns the value of `req` to the variable `k`. No other changes are made to the lists `ans1`, `ans2`, or `l`. Therefore, the state of these lists remains as described in the initial state, with `k` now being equal to `req`.
