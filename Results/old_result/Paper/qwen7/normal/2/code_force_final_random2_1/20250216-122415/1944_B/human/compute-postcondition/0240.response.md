Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -1, `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of list `l` appended with the element at index 2 of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of list `l` appended with the element at index 2 of list `l`, and `ans1` has the element at index 3 of list `l` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) of list `l` to `ans1`. Since `i` was already set to 3, appending the element at index 3 of list `l` to `ans1` modifies `ans1` accordingly. The other variables (`k`, `ans1`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
