Output State: **`arr` is [], `j` is 1, `lex` is either 0 or within the range [-26, 52], `info` contains [[lex, 26]], `i` is 1**

The code `arr = []` assigns an empty list to `arr`. This operation changes the value of `arr` from `[lex, 26]` to an empty list. The other variables (`j`, `lex`, `info`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
