Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The value of `T` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
