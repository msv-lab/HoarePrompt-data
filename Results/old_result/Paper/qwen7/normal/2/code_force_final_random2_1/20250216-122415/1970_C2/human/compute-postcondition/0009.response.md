Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers \((u, v)\), `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v]` and `nodes[v]` contains the value `[u]`, `u` is an integer read from input, `v` is an integer read from input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `u` and `v` from input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. These values are specific and depend on the user's input. All other variables retain their initial states.
