Output State: **`pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1; `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by 1; `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; if `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is set to 0, otherwise `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`**

Explanation: The code `pairs_in_D -= 1` decreases the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. The other conditions and assignments remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes `pairs_in_D` being decreased by 1, while the rest of the conditions and assignments stay as per the initial state.
