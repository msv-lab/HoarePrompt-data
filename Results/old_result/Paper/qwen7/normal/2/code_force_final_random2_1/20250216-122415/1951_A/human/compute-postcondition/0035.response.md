Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the new input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the new string `s`. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is even, then no changes are made to the variables. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is odd or `cnt1` == 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `cnt1` > 2 and '11' is found in the string `s`, no changes are made to the variables. If none of these conditions are met, no changes are made to the variables.**
