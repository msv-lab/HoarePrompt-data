Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `op` is 3, and either `num2 > 10000` and `op` is broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `op` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, and `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`.**
