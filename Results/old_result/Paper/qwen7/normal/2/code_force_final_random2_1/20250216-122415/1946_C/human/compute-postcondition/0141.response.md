Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is the final value determined by the loop, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `L` will be the smallest value such that `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`). The value of `R` will be the largest value such that `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`. In this case, since `L` starts at 50001 and `R` starts at 100001, and given the conditions inside the loop, `L` will eventually converge to the point where it cannot satisfy the condition `L - R <= 1` anymore, while `R` will be just above `L`. The variable `x` will be the midpoint value used in each iteration of the loop. The value of `numCuts` will remain 0 as no cuts are being made within the loop itself, and `leftover` will retain the result of `dfs(1, 1)` from the last iteration.
