Postcondition: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 2 if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1. `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list of integers where each integer `i + 1` is added to the list if the character at index `i` in `s1` is '>'. `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element. `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise it remains as a list containing 0. `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`. `i` is `n-4` if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is `n-3`. `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`. `ol` is `totalOne` if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`. `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
