Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specified that `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^4`, after executing the code, `n` will still satisfy this condition, being an integer within the specified range.
