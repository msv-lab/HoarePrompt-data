Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. According to the problem description, the winner is determined by whether the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd after all possible moves. However, the program incorrectly checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and decides the winner based on that condition alone.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 4`
- Expected Output: `Alice`

According to the game rules, let's analyze the game:
1. Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 4 coins.
2. Alice can either swap wallets or remove a coin from her wallet.
   - If Alice removes a coin, she now has 0 coins, and Bob still has 4 coins.
   - Bob then removes a coin, leaving him with 3 coins and Alice with 0 coins.
   - Alice again removes a coin, leaving her with 0 coins and Bob with 3 coins.
   - Bob removes a coin, leaving him with 2 coins and Alice with 0 coins.
   - Alice removes a coin, leaving her with 0 coins and Bob with 2 coins.
   - Bob removes a coin, leaving him with 1 coin and Alice with 0 coins.
   - Alice removes a coin, leaving her with 0 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
   - Bob removes a coin, leaving him with 0 coins and Alice with 0 coins.

Since both players end up with 0 coins, Alice makes the last move and wins. However, the program incorrectly prints "Bob" because the absolute difference between 1 and 4 is 3, which is odd, leading the program to print "Alice".

Thus, the program does not handle the game logic correctly, and the output is incorrect for the given test case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
