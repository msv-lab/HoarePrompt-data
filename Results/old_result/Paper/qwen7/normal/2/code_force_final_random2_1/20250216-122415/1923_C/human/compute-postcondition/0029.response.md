Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1` decreased by the value of the list `p` at index `a - 2`.
- Either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1 or `s` is less than `2 * (b - a + 1)`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. The values of `a`, `b`, `s`, and any other variables do not affect this print statement because it is a fixed string that is being printed.

Output: **NO**
