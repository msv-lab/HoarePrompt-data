Postcondition: **`beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] + 1`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `a` must have at least one element, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is updated to `freq[mod_x, mod_y] + 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in the dictionary `freq`, the variables `beautiful_count`, `mod_y`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` retain their updated values from the if condition, and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1. The condition that `a` must have at least one element is also maintained.
