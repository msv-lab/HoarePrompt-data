Output State: **`ans` is (((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + `t`) % `MOD`, `i` is 1, `t` is (4 * the maximum value that `tmp` could reach during the loop execution) % `MOD`**

Explanation: The code `t *= 2` multiplies the current value of `t` by 2. Since the initial state defines `t` as `(2 * the maximum value that `tmp` could reach during the loop execution) % `MOD`, after executing `t *= 2`, the new value of `t` becomes `(4 * the maximum value that `tmp` could reach during the loop execution) % `MOD`. The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged.
