Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and the range of the loop. Here, `j` is the loop variable.

2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: From the postcondition given, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range `range(2)`, which means `j` takes values from 0 to 1 (inclusive).

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 2. Since `j` is currently 1, it satisfies this condition and the loop can execute one more time.

5. **Adjust the state**: After the loop increments `j` by 1, `j` will become 2. However, since the loop condition checks if `j` is less than 2, the loop will stop executing when `j` becomes 2.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

**Final State**:
State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer, `arr` is either [1] or [26] depending on whether `lex` is less than 28, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1**
