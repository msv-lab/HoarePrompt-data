Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `lst` is `[n - 1]`
- `pk` and `mini` are defined such that the absolute difference between `pk` and the element `n - 1` in `lst` is equal to `mini`
- `final` is a list that has appended `elem`

### Loop Head:
```
for elem in lst:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable (`elem`)**: The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
2. **List (`lst`)**: The list `lst` contains a single element, which is `n - 1`.
3. **Variables (`pk` and `mini`)**: These variables are defined based on the current element in `lst` (which is `n - 1`).
4. **List (`final`)**: This list has appended `elem` from the previous iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Element (`elem`)**: Since `lst` contains only one element `n - 1`, the loop will iterate once with `elem` being `n - 1`.
2. **List (`lst`)**: After the first iteration, `lst` will be empty because it was consumed in the loop.
3. **Variables (`pk` and `mini`)**: These variables are defined based on the current element in `lst`. Since `lst` is now empty, `pk` and `mini` will not be redefined in this iteration.
4. **List (`final`)**: The list `final` will contain the element `elem` from the previous iteration, which is `n - 1`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
Since `lst` is now empty, the loop will terminate as there are no more elements to iterate over.

### Final Answer:
State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` and `mini` are undefined, and `final` is a list that contains the element `n - 1`.**

However, since the loop will terminate, the final state should reflect that the loop has completed.

State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` and `mini` are undefined, and `final` is a list that contains the element `n - 1`. The loop has terminated.**
