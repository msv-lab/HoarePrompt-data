Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements with its 3rd element (index 2) changed to '0'.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '0'` changes the 3rd element (index 2) of the list `s` to '0'. Since `i` is 2, this specific element is updated. The other variables (`x` and `s`'s other elements) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given condition.
