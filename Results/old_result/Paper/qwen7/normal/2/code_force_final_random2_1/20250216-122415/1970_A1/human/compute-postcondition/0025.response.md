Output State: `balance` will be 0, `details` is a list containing tuples where each tuple consists of the current `balance`, the negative index `-i`, and the corresponding character `char` from the string `s`. The length of `details` will be equal to the length of `s`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `balance` will return to 0 because every opening parenthesis '(' will eventually be matched with a closing parenthesis ')'. The `details` list will contain a tuple for each character in the string `s`, representing the balance at each step of the iteration, the negative index of the character, and the character itself. The exact contents of `details` depend on the content of `s`, but it will include one tuple per character in `s`.
