Postcondition: `y` is `n - 2`, `x` is `n - 1`, and `c` is `1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` remains `1`, `y` remains `n - 2`, and `x` remains `n - 1`. Otherwise, if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then the condition holds true. If `a` is greater than `l[x]`, then `a` remains unchanged and `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`.
