Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with one element `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the element `a[r]` to the list `b`. However, the initial state does not provide the exact values or the definition of `a` and `r`. Since no changes are made to `i` and `n`, their values remain the same. The only new information is that `b` now contains at least one element, which is `a[r]`.
