Output State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list with one additional element `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `sums` is updated according to the given formula, but since the exact value of `sums` before this operation is not specified, we only note that it has been updated. The list `ans` now contains one more element, which is the updated value of `sums`.
