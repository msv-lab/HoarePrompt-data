Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2, `k` is now k - 2 * a[r], and `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= a[r] * 2` subtracts `2 * a[r]` from `k`. Since `a[r]` is less than `a[l]` and `r` is `n - 1`, `a[r]` remains unchanged. The value of `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`. All other variables remain in their original state.
