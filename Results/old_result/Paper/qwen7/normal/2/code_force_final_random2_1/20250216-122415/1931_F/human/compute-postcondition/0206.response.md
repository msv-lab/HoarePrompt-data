Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx2` is updated to `i`, while `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, and the condition involving `l1` and `l2` remain the same as the initial state.
