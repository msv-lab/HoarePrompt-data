Postcondition: **`k` will be 0, and `heap` will contain all the elements that were popped from `combined` during the loop's iterations if `combined` was not empty. If `combined` became empty before all iterations, `heap` will be empty. The values of `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `test_cases`, `t`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` will remain unchanged from their initial or previous states. The condition `combined` is true**.
