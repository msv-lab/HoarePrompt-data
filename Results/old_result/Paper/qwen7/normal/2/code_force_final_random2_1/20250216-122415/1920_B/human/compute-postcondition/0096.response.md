Output State: **`i` is 0, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial values of `i` and `sums` remain unchanged. Since the input values for `n`, `k`, and `x` are not specified, they are left as variables representing the input integers.
