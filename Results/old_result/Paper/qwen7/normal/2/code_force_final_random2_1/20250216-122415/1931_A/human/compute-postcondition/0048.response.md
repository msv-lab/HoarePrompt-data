Postcondition: `j` is 0, `lex` is either -1 or within the range [-27, 51] or -26 or within the range [-52, -27], and `arr` is a list containing the elements 26, 26, 1 or 26, 26, 26. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is either -1 or within the range [-27, 51] and `arr` becomes a list containing the elements 26, 26, 1. Otherwise, `lex` is either -26 or within the range [-52, -27] and `arr` becomes a list containing the elements 26, 26, 26.
