Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine the number of possible initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that the sorted prefix sums of `a` match the given sorted prefix sums `p`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the number of ways to distribute `1`s and `-1`s in the array `a` such that the sorted prefix sums match `p`. It uses dynamic programming to achieve this. The key idea is to propagate the initial value `1` (representing the starting point of the prefix sum) through the possible values of the prefix sums, considering the constraints of the problem.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function processes multiple test cases. It reads the input, extracts the necessary parameters for each test case, and calls `func_1` to compute the result for each test case. Finally, it prints the results.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` correctly propagates the initial value `1` through the possible prefix sums, ensuring that the distribution of `1`s and `-1`s is consistent with the constraints of the problem. The use of modulo `998244353` ensures that the result fits within the required range.
   - **Function `func_2`**: The logic in `func_2` correctly processes each test case, extracts the necessary parameters, and calls `func_1` to compute the result. The results are stored and printed correctly.

Given the detailed analysis, both functions seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
