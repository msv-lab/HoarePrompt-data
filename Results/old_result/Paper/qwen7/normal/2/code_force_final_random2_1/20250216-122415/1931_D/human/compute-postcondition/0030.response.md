Output State: **`beautiful_count` is increased by 1, `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`, `num` is the second element of `a`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) is present in the set `freq` with a value of 1.**

Explanation: The line `beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` increments the value of `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Given that `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` is 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by 1. The values of `mod_x`, `num`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, and the tuple within `freq` remain unchanged.
