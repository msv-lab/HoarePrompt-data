Output State: **`y` is 3, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is `l[n - 1]`, `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`, `c` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` updates the value of `a` to be the element at index `x` in the list `l`. Given that `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is now set to `l[n - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
