Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. The initial states of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
