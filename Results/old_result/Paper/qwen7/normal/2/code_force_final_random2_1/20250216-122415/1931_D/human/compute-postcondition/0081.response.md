Output State: **`a` is a non-empty array with at least one element (excluding the first element), `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, and the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_y`, or the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq`. Therefore, these variables retain their original conditions.
