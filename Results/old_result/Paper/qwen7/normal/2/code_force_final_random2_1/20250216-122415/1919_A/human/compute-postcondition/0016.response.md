Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input**.

The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 is still valid. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the input.
