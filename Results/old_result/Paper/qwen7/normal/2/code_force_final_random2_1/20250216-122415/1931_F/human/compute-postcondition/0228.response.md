Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1 to become `k+2`, `idx1` is either `i` or remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `idx2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` is either 1 or remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p2` is either 1 or remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n` remains greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
