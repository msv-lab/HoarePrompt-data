Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n)`. The only variables involved are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is an input string.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if the loop is to continue, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - The string `s` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
