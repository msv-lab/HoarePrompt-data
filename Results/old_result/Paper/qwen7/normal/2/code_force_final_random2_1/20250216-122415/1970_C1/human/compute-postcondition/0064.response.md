Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `tree` is a deque with `v` as its only element, and `empty` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(v)` appends the value of `v` to the left of the deque `tree`. Given that `tree` was initially a list or deque with one or two elements, and if `empty` is `False`, it means `tree` contains the elements `u` and `v`. After appending `v` to the left, `tree` becomes a deque with `v` as its only element. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `empty` remain unchanged.
