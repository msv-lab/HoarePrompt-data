Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between \(k\) and \(2k\), `i` is \(k-1\), `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0. If `m == 1`, then `m` is set to 1. Otherwise, the list `dp` will be updated such that `dp[i]` for every `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive will be calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `i` will be equal to `m`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `c`, `r`, `m`) will retain their values as they were after the last iteration of the loop.**
