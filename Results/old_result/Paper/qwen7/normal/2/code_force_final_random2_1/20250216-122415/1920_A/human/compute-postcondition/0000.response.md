Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `loop = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `loop` is now assigned the value of the user's input, which is an integer.
