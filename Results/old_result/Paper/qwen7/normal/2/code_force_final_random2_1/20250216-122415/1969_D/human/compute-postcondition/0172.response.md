Output State: **`bonuses` is a list containing the results of `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains one element from `neg_prices` and one element from `bonuses`.**

The code creates a new list called `combined` which is a zipped version of `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. Each element in `combined` is a tuple consisting of one element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
