You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns either 1 or 6. If the string `s` is exactly 'mapie', it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' and then all occurrences of the substring 'pie', incrementing a counter `ans` for each removal. After processing, if any part of 'pie' remains, `ans` will be 6 and `s` will be an empty string; otherwise, it returns 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it "beautiful". A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and aims to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.
   - It first checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie" and returns 1 if true. This check is unnecessary because it only handles one specific case and does not cover other possible scenarios where "pie" or "map" might appear elsewhere in the string.
   - The function then uses two while loops to find and remove occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string `s`. For each occurrence found, it increments the counter `ans` and updates the string `s` by removing the matched substring.

3. **Issues with the Function**:
   - The check `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is redundant and incorrect. It only handles the specific case of "mapie" but fails to handle other cases where "pie" or "map" might appear in different positions.
   - The function correctly removes "map" and "pie" but does not ensure that it finds and removes the minimum number of characters. The current implementation may not always find the optimal solution, especially when multiple overlapping occurrences of "pie" or "map" exist.

4. **Optimization**:
   - To ensure the minimum number of deletions, we should use a more efficient approach such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that ensures the removal of the minimum number of characters.

### Conclusion:

The provided function `func_1` is incorrect because it incorrectly handles the specific case of "mapie" and does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions. Therefore, the given program is not correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
