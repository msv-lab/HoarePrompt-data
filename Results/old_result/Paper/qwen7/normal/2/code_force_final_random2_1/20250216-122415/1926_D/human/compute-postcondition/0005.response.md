Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary.**

The code creates an empty dictionary named `dic`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `data`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `n` being an input integer and `data` being a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, while adding that `dic` is now an empty dictionary.
