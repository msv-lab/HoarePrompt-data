Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `zero` is 2
   - `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` remains the same
   - `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of (2 * 100 / (3 + 1))
   - `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1))
   - `lst` is [3]

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` remains the same.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `zero` remains 2.
   - `one` remains unchanged since it was not specified to change during the loop iteration.
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `zero_perc` remains the same since it is calculated based on `zero` and `i`, and these values have not changed.
   - `one_perc` remains the same since it is calculated based on `o`, `one`, and `n`, and these values have not changed.
   - `lst` remains [3].

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`zero` is 2, `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2, `i` is 4, `n` remains the same, `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of (2 * 100 / (3 + 1)), `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)), `lst` is [3]**
