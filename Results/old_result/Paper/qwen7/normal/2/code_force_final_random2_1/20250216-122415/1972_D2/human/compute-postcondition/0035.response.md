To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head:

The loop condition is:
\[ (x + y) \times x \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (x + y) \times y \leq m \]

Given the current state:
- \( x = 2 \)
- \( n \geq 8 \)
- \( m \geq 8 \)
- \( y = 3 \)
- \( cnt = 2 \)

First, let's evaluate the loop condition with the given values:
\[ (x + y) \times x = (2 + 3) \times 2 = 5 \times 2 = 10 \]
\[ (x + y) \times y = (2 + 3) \times 3 = 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Since \( n \geq 8 \) and \( m \geq 8 \), both conditions \( 10 \leq n \) and \( 15 \leq m \) are satisfied.

For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions must still be true at the start of the next iteration. The only variables that affect these conditions are \( x \) and \( y \).

Let's consider the possible changes to \( x \) and \( y \):

1. **If \( x \) increases**: 
   - \( (x + y) \times x \) will increase.
   - \( (x + y) \times y \) will also increase.
   - For the loop to continue, \( (x + y) \times x \) must still be less than or equal to \( n \) and \( (x + y) \times y \) must still be less than or equal to \( m \).

2. **If \( y \) increases**: 
   - Similar to \( x \), \( (x + y) \times x \) and \( (x + y) \times y \) will increase.
   - For the loop to continue, \( (x + y) \times x \) must still be less than or equal to \( n \) and \( (x + y) \times y \) must still be less than or equal to \( m \).

Given the current values:
- \( x = 2 \)
- \( y = 3 \)

To ensure the loop continues, \( x \) and \( y \) should remain such that the conditions are still met. Since \( n \geq 8 \) and \( m \geq 8 \), increasing either \( x \) or \( y \) while keeping the product conditions valid would require:
- \( (x + y) \times x \leq n \)
- \( (x + y) \times y \leq m \)

Since the current values already satisfy the conditions, we need to ensure that the values of \( x \) and \( y \) do not violate these conditions in the next iteration. Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are \( x \) and \( y \).

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, and both must ensure that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`**
