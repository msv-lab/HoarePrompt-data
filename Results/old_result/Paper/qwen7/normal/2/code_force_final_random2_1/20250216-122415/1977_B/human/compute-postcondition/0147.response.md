Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is 29, and `s[1]` is '0', `s[2]` is '-1'**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[2]` to '-1'. The other variables (`flag`, `i`, `n`, and `s[1]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the condition given. Since the condition `flag and s[i] == '0'` was not met (as `s[2]` was '0' before the assignment), `flag` remains 0.
