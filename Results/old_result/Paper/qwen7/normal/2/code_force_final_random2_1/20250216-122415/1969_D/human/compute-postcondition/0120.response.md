Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains elements popped from `combined` during the loop's iterations if `combined` was not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]`, and `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, `combined` is now one item smaller, `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, and the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `item[1]` from `current_profit`. Since `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, and the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, this subtraction updates the value of `current_profit` accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
