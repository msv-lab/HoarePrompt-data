Output State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, `costs` remains a list of `n` elements, `i` is `len(costs) - k`. `total_costs` has one additional element which is the sum of the last `k` elements of the `costs` list.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of the slice of the `costs` list from index `i` to `i + k` to `total_costs`. Given that `i` was initially `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`, after the operation, `i` is updated to `len(costs) - k`. The `total_costs` list now includes the sum of the last `k` elements of the `costs` list as its new last element. All other variables remain unchanged.
