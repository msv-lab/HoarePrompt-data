Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `tree` is a list with one element `v`. If `u` equals the last element of `tree`, then `u` is unchanged; otherwise, the postcondition remains as initially described.
