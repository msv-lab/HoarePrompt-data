Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is either 0 or within the range [-26, 52]; `arr` is a list containing the elements 26, 26, 1.**

The code `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the elements `26, 26`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `26, 26, 1`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
