Reasoning:
1. The provided function processes multiple test cases, correctly reading the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) for each test case.
2. It then reads a list of ticket prices for \( n \) days.
3. The function sorts the list of ticket prices, which is unnecessary because the algorithm does not rely on the order of the prices but rather on the cumulative sum calculation.
4. The function initializes `s` to \( k \) and iterates through the list of prices, updating `s` to be the minimum of `m` and the remaining number of tickets to be purchased (`k`). This ensures that no more than \( m \) tickets are purchased in a single day.
5. During each iteration, it updates the cumulative sum `c` by adding the cost of the tickets purchased (`l[i] * s`) minus the penalty for purchasing multiple tickets (`s * s / 2`).
6. The function correctly handles the reduction of `k` by the number of tickets purchased in each iteration.
7. After processing all days, it prints the final cumulative sum `c`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the function appears to correctly implement the required algorithm to find the minimum spending to purchase \( k \) tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
