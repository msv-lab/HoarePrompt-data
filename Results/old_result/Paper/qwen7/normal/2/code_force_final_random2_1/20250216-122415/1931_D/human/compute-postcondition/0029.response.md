Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.
   - `num` is the second element of `a`, so `num = a[1]`.
   - `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`, which means `mod_x = num % x`.
   - `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, which simplifies to `x - mod_x` if `x > mod_x`, otherwise it's `x - mod_x + x` to ensure it's within the range `[0, x-1]`.
   - `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, but `mod_y` is not defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it's a separate value.
   - The tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) is present in the set `freq` with a value of 1, implying that `num % y` equals `mod_x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
       )
   ```

Given this breakdown, let's determine what will be printed:

- `num` is the second element of the list `a`, so `num = a[1]`.
- `mod_x` is `num % x`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, but since `mod_y` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `num % y` must equal `mod_x` because the tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) is in the set `freq` with a value of 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output the following:

Output: **Number: [a[1]], mod_x: [num % x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [(x - (num % x)) % x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]**
