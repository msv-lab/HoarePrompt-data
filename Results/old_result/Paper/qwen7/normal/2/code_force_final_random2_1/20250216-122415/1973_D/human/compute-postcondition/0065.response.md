Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `k` must be 1 (though it's not used in the print statement).
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 1.
   - `l` also equals `n` + 1, so `l = 1 + 1 = 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - To determine what will be printed, we need to know the value of `v`.
   - Since `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value directly from the given information.

Given the information, we can only infer that `i` is 2 and `v` is some unknown value. Therefore, the print statement will output a string with `i * v`, where `i` is 2.

Output: **! 2*v**
