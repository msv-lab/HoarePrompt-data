Output State: **`li` is a list with one element equal to `a + k * c + 3 * d`, `h` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Since `h` is 3, the expression becomes `a + k * c + 3 * d`. The values of `h` and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
