Output State: **`zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))**.

This means that the value of `zero` and `one` have been updated based on the condition of `s[i]`. Specifically, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'. The value of `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of `zero` times 100 divided by `(i + 1)`. Similarly, `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of `(o - one)` times 100 divided by `(n - i - 1)`. The initial conditions for `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are now dependent on the updated values of `zero`, `one`, `i`, and `n`.
