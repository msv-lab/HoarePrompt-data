Postcondition: `combined` has at least one element less than before; if the sum of the first and second elements of the last element of `combined` before popping is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is reduced by the second element of the last element of `combined` before popping; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the value of the last element of `combined` before popping; `item` is the last element of `combined` before popping.
