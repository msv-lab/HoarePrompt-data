Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` after the previous iteration, `c` is `c + x`, `p` has an additional element which is the value of `c + x`**.

Explanation: The code `p.append(c)` appends the current value of `c` (which is `c + x`) to the list `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
