Postcondition: `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) filled with zeros. `dp` is defined, and `j` is \(k + 1\). If `j - 1` is within the bounds of the list (i.e., \(j - 1 \geq 0\) and \(j - 1 \leq 2 \times n\)), then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\). If `j - 1` is out of bounds, no updates are made to `new_dp`.
