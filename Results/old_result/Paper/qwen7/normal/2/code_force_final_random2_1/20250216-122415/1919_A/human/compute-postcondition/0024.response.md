Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it determines whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints either "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
