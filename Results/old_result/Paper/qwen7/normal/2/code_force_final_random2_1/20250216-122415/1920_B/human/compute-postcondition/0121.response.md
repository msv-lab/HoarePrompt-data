Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `sums` remain unchanged. The updated value of `sums` is included in the list `ans`.
