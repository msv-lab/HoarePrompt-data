Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, v is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and p is a permutation of n integers from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The provided code is a docstring for a decorator function and does not actually modify any of the variables `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
