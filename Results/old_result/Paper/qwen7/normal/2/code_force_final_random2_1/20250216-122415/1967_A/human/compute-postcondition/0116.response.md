Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is unchanged, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is 0, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `rem = k % (i + 1)` calculates the remainder when `k` is divided by `i + 1`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing the line of code, `i` becomes 3. The value of `rem` is updated to `k % 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
