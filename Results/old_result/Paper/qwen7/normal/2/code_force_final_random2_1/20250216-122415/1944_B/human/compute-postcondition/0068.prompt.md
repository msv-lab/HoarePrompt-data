Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is either twice the original value of `k` or twice the original value of `k` minus 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, the first element of `b` is not equal to the second element of `b`, `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order starting from index `n` of list `a`, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of list `b` appended with the element at index `n-1` of list `b`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of list `b`, `req` is equal to the original value of `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` and either the last element of `b` or the element at index `n-1` of `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is an integer. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to `k - 2`, `b[i]` is added to the list `ans1`, and `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged (does not equal 0), `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, and either `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` and the list `l` includes the element `b[i]`, or there is no additional change to the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is reduced by 2, and `b[i]` is appended to `ans1`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `b[i]` is added to `l` if it is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `i` is now `i + 1`, `n` remains the same. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is reduced by 2 and `ans1` has the additional element `b[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, `l` has appended the value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
