Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `new` is a list starting from `a[0]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether not all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether not all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to the length of `new`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of `check_all_new` and `new_all` are not relevant to the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **NO**
