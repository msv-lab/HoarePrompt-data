Output State: **`count` is increased by 1, `num` is 1, `num` is equal to `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `count` is incremented by 1, while the values of `num` and its definition remain unchanged. Therefore, `num` is still 1 and also defined as `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.
