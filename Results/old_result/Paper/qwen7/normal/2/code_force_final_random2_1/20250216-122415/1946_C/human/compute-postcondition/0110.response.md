Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. These values are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still 2 and `n` must still be greater than 3.
