Based on the initial state provided, `results` is a non-empty list, and `result` holds the current element being processed from this list. Since `result` is holding the current element being processed, it must be one of the elements in the `results` list.

However, the exact value of `result` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe it in terms of its relationship to the `results` list.

Output: **the current element in the `results` list (where the current element is the value of `result`)**
