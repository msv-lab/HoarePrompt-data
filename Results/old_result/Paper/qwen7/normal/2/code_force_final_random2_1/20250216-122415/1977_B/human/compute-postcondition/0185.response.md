Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 29.
   - `length` is greater than 29.
   - The postcondition specifies that if `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is changed to '0'. Otherwise, the values of `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1 at the beginning of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 30.
   - The condition `length > 29` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing.

Based on these observations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 30, `length` is greater than 29**
