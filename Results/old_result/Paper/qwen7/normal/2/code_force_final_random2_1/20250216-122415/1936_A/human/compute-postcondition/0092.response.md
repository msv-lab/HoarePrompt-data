Output State: **`i` is `len(pans)`, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer of `sys.stdout`. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
