Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values Calculation:**
   - It initializes `sum_f` to 0.
   - For each of the `m` pairs of friends, it reads `a`, `b`, and `f` and adds `f` to `sum_f`.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - `cn2` is calculated as \( \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \), which represents the total number of unique pairs from `n` children.
   - The expression `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` is used to calculate the numerator of the expected value.
   - The denominator is `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

4. **GCD Calculation and Simplification:**
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator is calculated using `math.gcd`.
   - Both the numerator and denominator are divided by the GCD to simplify the fraction.

5. **Modular Inverse and Output:**
   - The simplified numerator `p` is multiplied by the modular inverse of the simplified denominator `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and printed.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums up the friendship values of all given pairs.

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula used for the expected value calculation seems to be incorrect. The expected value should consider the probability of picking each pair and how the friendship value changes over excursions. The current formula does not account for these probabilities and changes in friendship values accurately.

3. **GCD and Simplification:**
   - The GCD calculation and simplification steps are correct and necessary to ensure the fraction is in its simplest form.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic (`pow(q, -1, M)`) to find the modular inverse is correct.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values. The provided formula does not accurately reflect the expected value as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
