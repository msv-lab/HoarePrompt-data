Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` is `s // 2`, `mini` is undefined, `final` is a sorted list containing either an element `n` or the element 0, and the length of `final` is 1; `c1` is either greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n` (which is replaced by the input integer `s`) divided by 2 to `pk`. All other variables remain unchanged.
