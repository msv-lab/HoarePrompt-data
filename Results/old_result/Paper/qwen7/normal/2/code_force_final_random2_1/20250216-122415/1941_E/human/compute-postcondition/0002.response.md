Output State: **`rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers converted from the input split by spaces, and `costs` is a list of `n` elements, each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list called `costs` using a list comprehension. For each row in `rows`, it calls the function `func_1(row, d)` and stores the result in the corresponding position in the `costs` list. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, and `rows` retains its original structure and content.
