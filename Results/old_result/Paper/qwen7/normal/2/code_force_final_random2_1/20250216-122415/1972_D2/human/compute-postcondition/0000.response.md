Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input operation. The other conditions and constraints (like `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6`) are not affected by this line of code and remain as preconditions.
