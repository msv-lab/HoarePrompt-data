Output State: **`data` is a list of integers with at least one element, `s` is the bitwise XOR of the first element of `data` and the variable `check` with the value decreased by 1, `ans` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the list `data` remains unchanged, the value of `s` is updated to be the bitwise XOR of the first element of `data` and `check` with 1 subtracted from it, and the variable `ans` is decreased by 1.
