Output State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string, and `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `mak`. No other changes are made to the other variables or their conditions. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `pans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
