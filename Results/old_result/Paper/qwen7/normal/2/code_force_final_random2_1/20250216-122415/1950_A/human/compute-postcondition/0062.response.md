Output State: `i` is 1001, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' based on the conditions of the if and else blocks.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i` being 1 until `i` exceeds 1000. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, once `i` reaches 1001, the condition `i <= 1000` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate. At this point, the value of `i` will be 1001. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will still be random integers generated within each iteration of the loop, and `res` will be determined based on the conditions provided in the loop body.
