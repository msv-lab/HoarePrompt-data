Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a k-level permutation of length n.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the list at indices that are multiples of `k` with consecutive integers starting from 2.
   - The logic seems to be flawed because it does not cover all indices of the list and does not ensure that the resulting permutation is k-level.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to handle multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - However, `func_1()` does not correctly generate a k-level permutation as described in the problem statement.

3. **Problem Description vs. Functionality**:
   - The problem requires generating a k-level permutation where the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not ensure that the sums of these segments meet the k-level condition.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation does not correctly generate a k-level permutation. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
