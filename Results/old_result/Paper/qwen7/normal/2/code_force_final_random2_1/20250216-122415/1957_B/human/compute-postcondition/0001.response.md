Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to `l1`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
