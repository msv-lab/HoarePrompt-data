Output State: **`beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `a` is a non-empty array with at least one element, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
