Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2, `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; if `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is set to 0, otherwise `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`**

Explanation: The code `E[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `E[out_aa]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
