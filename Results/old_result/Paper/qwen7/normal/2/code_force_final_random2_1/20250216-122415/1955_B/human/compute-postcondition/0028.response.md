Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for h in range(0, n):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `h` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `li` now contains the element `a + k * c + d * (h_prev + 1)`.
   - `h` is `h_prev + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than `h_prev + 1`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `h` is `h_prev + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `h` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than `h_prev + 1`, `h` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making it `h_prev + 2`.
   - Therefore, `h` must be `h_prev + 2` for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `li` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `h` is updated to `h_prev + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head but is used to determine the loop condition.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`li` now contains the element `a + k * c + d * (h_prev + 1)`, `h` is `h_prev + 2`, and `n` is greater than `h_prev + 1`**.
