Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[l]`, `a[r]` is reduced by `a[l]`; if `a[r]` equals 0, `sunks` is 1, `sunks` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `sunks` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
