Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is `sums + a[1]`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums + a[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given that `sums` is defined as `sums + a[i - 1]`, when `i` is 2, `sums` becomes `sums + a[1]`. Since `ans` was previously containing the value of `sums` after the update, now `ans` will contain the updated value of `sums` which is `sums + a[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
