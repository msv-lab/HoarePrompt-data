Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers in reverse order.**

Explanation: The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a` in place. Since `a` was initially a list of sorted integers, after executing this line, `a` will contain the same integers but in reverse order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
