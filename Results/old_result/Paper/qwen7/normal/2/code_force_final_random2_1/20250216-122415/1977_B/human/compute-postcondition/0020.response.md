Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` is the value of `int(input())`, `x` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is a list containing either '1', '0', and '1' or '1', '0', and '0', `length` is 30. If `x` has the bit at position `i` (which is 2) set to 1, then `s` contains '1', '0', and '1'. Otherwise, `s` contains '1', '0', and '0'.
