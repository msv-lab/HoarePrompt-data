Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - It initializes an array `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to `0`.
   - It uses a loop to fill the `permutation` array in a specific pattern:
     - For each index `i` starting from `0` to `k-1`, it sets every `k`-th position starting from `i` to the value of `curr_v`.
     - It increments `curr_v` after setting each value.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - After processing each test case, it decrements `t`.

### Verification of Correctness

To verify if the program correctly generates a k-level permutation, we need to check if the generated permutation satisfies the condition that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length `k` is at most 1.

#### Example Analysis

Let's manually verify the logic using one of the provided examples:

- **Example**: `n = 10`, `k = 4`
- **Generated Permutation**: `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`

Let's calculate the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` (which is 4):

1. `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`
2. `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`
3. `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`
4. `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`
5. `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`
6. `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`
7. `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`

The sums are: `[23, 24, 23, 24, 23, 24, 23]`

The maximum sum is `24` and the minimum sum is `23`. The difference is `24 - 23 = 1`, which satisfies the condition for a k-level permutation.

### General Case

The logic in `func_1` ensures that each segment of length `k` will have a similar pattern of values, ensuring that the sums of these segments will be close to each other. Since the values are incremented by 1 for each `k`-th position, the sums will vary by at most 1.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given constraints.

**Correctness: **True**
