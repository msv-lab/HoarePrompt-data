Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the binary search process converges such that `L` and `R` become equal. Given that `numCuts` remains 0 throughout the iterations, the condition `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)` is never satisfied. Therefore, `L` and `R` both end up being 50001. The variable `x` is set to the final value of `L` (or `R`), which is 50001. The value of `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is not modified by the loop.
