Output State: **`zero` is `zero` + 1, `one` remains unchanged, `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((`zero` - 1) * 100 / (`previous_i` + 4)), `one_perc` remains unchanged unless (`zero` - 1) / (`previous_i` + 4) * 100 >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, in which case it is updated to math.ceil((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - (`previous_i` + 3))), `lst` now contains `previous_i` + 2**

Explanation: 
- `zero` is incremented by 1.
- The calculation for `zero_perc` updates to `math.ceil((zero - 1) * 100 / (previous_i + 4))`.
- The condition for updating `one_perc` remains the same, but the calculation changes to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (previous_i + 3)))` if the condition is met.
- `one` remains unchanged.
- `lst` is updated to contain `previous_i + 2`.
