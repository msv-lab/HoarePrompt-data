Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the integer representation of the last element of `arr`, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the value of `arr[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the program to exit the current loop or conditional block. Since no new assignments or operations are performed, the values of `m`, `i`, `arr[i - 1]`, `ans`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
