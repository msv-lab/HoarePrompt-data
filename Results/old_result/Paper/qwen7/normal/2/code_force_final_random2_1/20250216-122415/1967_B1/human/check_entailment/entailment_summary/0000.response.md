Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Let's break down the requirements and the current implementation:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - Calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`.
   - It then iterates over values of \( b \) from 2 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \).
   - For each \( b \), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.

3. **Issues**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not correctly handled.
   - The calculation \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not account for the actual pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition.
   - The program does not iterate over all possible values of \(a\) for each \(b\).

Given these issues, the current implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
