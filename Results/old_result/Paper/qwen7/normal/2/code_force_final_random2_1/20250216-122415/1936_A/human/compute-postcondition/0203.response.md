Output State: **`mak2` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-2`, `pans` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than `i`.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only flushes the output buffer, which is an operation related to the standard output stream and does not modify any variables in the given initial state. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
