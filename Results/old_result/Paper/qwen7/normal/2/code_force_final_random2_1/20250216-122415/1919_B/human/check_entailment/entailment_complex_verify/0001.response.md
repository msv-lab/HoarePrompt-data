### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the function `func_1` is incorrect and why the program as a whole does not solve the problem correctly.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of `+` characters in the string `expression` and calculates `sub` as `length - count`.
   - It then returns `abs(sub - count)`, which does not reflect the actual penalty calculation as described in the problem statement.
   - The function does not perform any splitting of the array or calculate the penalties of the subarrays. Instead, it computes a value that is unrelated to the optimal penalty calculation.

2. **Optimal Penalty Calculation**:
   - The optimal strategy is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero whenever possible. This way, the penalty for each subarray will be zero.
   - The function `func_1` does not implement this strategy. It simply computes the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters, which is not the correct approach.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the example provided in the problem description:
     - For `expression = "-----"` and `length = 5`, the function `func_1` would return `abs(5 - 0) = 5`, but the correct answer should be `5` because the optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
     - For `expression = "+-+-+"` and `length = 6`, the function `func_1` would return `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, but the correct answer should be `0` because the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `0 + 0 = 0`.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
