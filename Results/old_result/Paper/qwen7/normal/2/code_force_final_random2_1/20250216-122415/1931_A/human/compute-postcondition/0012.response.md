Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is equal to 2; `arr` contains the element 26**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 26, making its new value `lex - 26`. Given that `lex` was initially between 28 and 51 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from it results in a value between 2 and 25 (inclusive). Since the exact initial value of `lex` is not specified, we express the new value of `lex` as `lex - 26`, which simplifies to 2 given the range. The values of `j` and the elements in `arr` remain unchanged.
