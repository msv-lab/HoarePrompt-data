Output State: **`j` is 0 or 1, `lex` is between 2 and 52, `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Given that `lex` was initially between 28 and 78 and greater than or equal to 52, subtracting 26 from `lex` results in a new value for `lex` that is between 2 and 52. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
