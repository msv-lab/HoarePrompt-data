Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). The function returns a result based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases internally, where each test case consists of specific parameters and lists. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case without requiring any external parameters.
