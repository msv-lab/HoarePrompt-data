Output State: `t` is equal to 0.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be reduced by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0. Since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, once `t` becomes 0, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be equal to 0.
