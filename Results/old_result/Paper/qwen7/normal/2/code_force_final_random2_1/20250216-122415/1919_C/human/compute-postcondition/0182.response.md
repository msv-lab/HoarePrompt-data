Output State: **`y` is -1, `x` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The value of `y` remains `-1`, and the value of `x` remains `n - 1`. The initial value of `c` and the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` are not affected by this line of code.
