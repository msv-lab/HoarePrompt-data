Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The key issues are:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Non-Decreasing Order**: The program checks if the last digit of each number (except the first one) is less than or equal to the last digit of the previous number. This is not sufficient to ensure the entire sequence can be transformed into a non-decreasing order through the allowed operations.
   
2. **Incorrect Handling of Digits Splitting**: The program does not properly handle the splitting of numbers and checking if the resulting sequence can be sorted. It only checks if the digits form a non-decreasing sequence when reversed, which is not the same as ensuring the original sequence can be transformed into a non-decreasing order.

3. **No Implementation of Digit Splitting Operation**: The program does not actually perform the digit splitting operation and check if the resulting sequence can be sorted. Instead, it only checks a simple condition based on the last digits.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to sort the array using the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
