You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both of which are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. If n equals k, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 twice and returns k. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' and returns None. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the sum of certain values and prints 'NO' if this sum is less than k. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', 2, 'YES' again, and the list [1]. Regardless of the case, the function returns None.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires setting up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. The program needs to handle multiple test cases and output "YES" or "NO" accordingly, along with the number of stalls and their respective prices if "YES".

### Given Program Analysis

#### Input Handling
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k`.

#### Function `func_1`
- The function `func_1` is defined but not implemented properly.
- The function should check if it's possible to achieve the exact number of jewels `k` with the given coins `n`.
- If `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up one stall with price 1.
- If `n < k`, it prints "NO".
- For other cases, it attempts to split the coins into two parts and checks if the sum of the divisions can cover `k` stalls.

### Issues in the Given Program

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The function `func_1` is not fully implemented. The logic inside the function is incomplete and does not correctly handle all cases.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for determining whether it's possible to achieve exactly `k` jewels is flawed. Specifically, the current implementation only checks for two splits and does not consider more complex scenarios.
3. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly format the output for cases where it determines "YES". It should print the number of stalls and the prices for each stall.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that we can always find a way to distribute the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    # Try to set up stalls with decreasing prices
    stalls = []
    price = n
    while k > 0 and price >= 1:
        if price >= k:
            stalls.append(k)
            price -= k
            k = 0
        else:
            stalls.append(price)
            k -= 1
            price = 0
    if k > 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases and processes each case.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Checks if `n` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO".
   - Initializes an empty list `stalls` to store the prices.
   - Uses a loop to distribute the coins among the stalls:
     - If the current price (`price`) is greater than or equal to `k`, set the price to `k` and decrement `k`.
     - Otherwise, set the price to the current value of `price` and decrement `k` by 1.
   - If `k` is still greater than 0 after the loop, it means it's impossible to achieve exactly `k` jewels, so it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices for each stall.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the original program and the need for a correct approach, the provided solution is more aligned with the problem requirements. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
