Output State: The final state of `dp` after the loop executes all iterations is such that for every index `j` from 1 to \(2 * n\), `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all positive values in the original `dp` list, distributed across its indices from 1 to \(2 * n\) and then reduced modulo `MOD`. This means that each positive value in the original `dp` list contributes to the sum of its neighboring indices in the final `dp` list, with the contributions being accumulated over all iterations of the loop.

All other variables remain unchanged, including the initial `offset` which was set to 0, and the list `p` which is not affected by the loop.
