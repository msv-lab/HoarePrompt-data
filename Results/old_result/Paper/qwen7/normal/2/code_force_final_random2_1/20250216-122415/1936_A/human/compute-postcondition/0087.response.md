Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are the result of `int(input())`, which we'll call `iterations`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `mak` is `n - 1`
   - `i` is `len(pans)`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `s` is the input string '>'
   - `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` is set to `len(pans)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `iterations` (the result of `int(input())`) must be greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is already set to `len(pans)`, it does not change within the loop itself but rather is determined by the loop head.
   - `mak`, `n`, `s`, and `pans` do not change based on the loop head.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `iterations`, which is the result of `int(input())` and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`mak` is `n - 1`, `i` is `len(pans)`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`, `iterations` must be greater than 0**.
