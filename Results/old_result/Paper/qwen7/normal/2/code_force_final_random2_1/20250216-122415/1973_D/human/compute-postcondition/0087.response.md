Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2()` + 1, and the condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` is true.**

Explanation: The code `func_2()` is called, but since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, its exact behavior cannot be determined. However, the preconditions and the values of the variables before calling `func_2()` remain unchanged. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `cnt`, and `l` stay the same, and the condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` also remains true.
