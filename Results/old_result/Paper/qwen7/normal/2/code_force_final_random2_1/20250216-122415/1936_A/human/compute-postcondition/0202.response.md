Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `mak2` is `n-1`
   - `mak` is `n-1`
   - `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `pans` is an empty list
   - `n` must be greater than `i`

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Values of Variables:**
   - `mak` is `n-1`
   - `mak2` is `n-1`
   - `i` is `n-2`

Given these values, the print statement will output the following:
- The string `'?'`
- The value of `mak`, which is `n-1`
- The value of `mak2`, which is `n-1`
- The value of `i`, which is `n-2`
- The value of `mak2`, which is `n-1`

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? n-1 n-1 n-2 n-1'**
