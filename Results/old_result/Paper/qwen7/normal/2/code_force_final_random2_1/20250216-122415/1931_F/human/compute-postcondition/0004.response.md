Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is 1, and we take an input from the user.**

The code `input()` simply waits for user input and does not assign the input to any variable. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. We only note that an input has been taken from the user.
