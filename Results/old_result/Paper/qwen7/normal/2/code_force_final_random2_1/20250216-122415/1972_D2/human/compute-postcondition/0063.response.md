Output State: `x` is greater than the square root of `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for each iteration where the gcd of `x` and `y` is 1, starting from `y = 1` until the condition `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` is met, `y` is the last value of `y` that satisfied the conditions in the inner loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be greater than the square root of `n`. The variable `cnt` will hold the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` such that the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true. The value of `y` will be the last value it took during the last iteration of the inner loop before the conditions were no longer satisfied.
