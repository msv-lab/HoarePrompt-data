Postcondition: **`combined` will be an empty list, `max_profit` will be updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `test_cases` will remain unchanged, `t` will remain unchanged, `heap` will contain all elements that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, `remaining_items` will be an empty list, and `current_profit` will be the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` will be 0.**
