Output State: **`k` is -2 * (len(l) - 1), `ans1` is a list that includes all elements from `l`, and `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one.**

Explanation: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range of the length of the list `l`. Since the loop breaks when `k` becomes 0, and `k` starts at `-2 * (n-1)` where `n` is the length of `l`, it will run exactly `len(l)` times. Each iteration appends the current element of `l` to both `ans1` and `ans2`. After all iterations, `k` will be `-2 * (len(l) - 1)`, `ans1` will contain all elements of `l`, and `ans2` will also contain all elements of `l` except the last one since `ans2` is initialized with the first element and then appended with each subsequent element.
