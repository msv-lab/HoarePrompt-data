Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `s` is the input string (though its content is not relevant for this print statement).
   - `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Evaluating the Print Statement:**
   - `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`. According to the initial state, `pans` contains the elements from 0 to `n-2`. Therefore, `pans[0]` is 0.
   - `pans[i]`: Since `i` is `n-1`, `pans[i]` is `pans[n-1]`. However, `pans` only contains elements from 0 to `n-2`, so `pans[n-1]` does not exist. In Python, accessing an index that is out of bounds results in an IndexError if the code were to run, but here we are just describing the value that would be printed. Given the context, it implies that `pans[n-1]` is not defined within the list.

Given the above, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 0 0 [undefined] [undefined]**
