You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as many times as specified by the user through the input. After all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and for each iteration, there are corresponding values of `n` and `k` provided by the user, where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\). The final output state will include all these inputs and their respective processed results from the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes all its iterations, `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 1000, and for each iteration, there will be a pair of integers `n` and `k` that were input by the user, along with the result of the loop's processing for those pairs.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges.
   - If `n - k <= 1`, it means that even after destroying `k` bridges, Everule can still visit all remaining islands (or just one if `n == 1`).
   - Otherwise, Everule can only visit one island (island 1).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then checks if `n - k <= 1`. If true, it prints `n` (all islands are reachable). Otherwise, it prints `1` (only island 1 is reachable).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - If `n - k <= 1`, this condition correctly identifies that Everule can still visit all islands or just one island.
   - If `n - k > 1`, the logic correctly identifies that Everule can only visit one island.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `n == 1`, `n - k` will always be greater than or equal to 1, so the program correctly prints `1`.
   - When `k == 0`, `n - k` will be `n`, so the program correctly prints `n`.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the example test cases:
     - `2 0`: `2 - 0 <= 1` is false, so it prints `1`.
     - `2 1`: `2 - 1 <= 1` is true, so it prints `2`.
     - `4 1`: `4 - 1 <= 1` is false, so it prints `1`.
     - `5 10`: `5 - 10 <= 1` is false, so it prints `1`.
     - `5 3`: `5 - 3 <= 1` is true, so it prints `5`.
     - `4 4`: `4 - 4 <= 1` is true, so it prints `1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
