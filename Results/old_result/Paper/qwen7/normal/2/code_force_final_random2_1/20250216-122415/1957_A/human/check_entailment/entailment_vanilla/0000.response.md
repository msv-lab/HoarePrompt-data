### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Stick Counting**: For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths into an array `arr`.
3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`.
4. **Polygon Formation**: To form a regular polygon, each side must be equal, and the number of sides must divide the total count of that length without remainder. Since a minimum of 3 sides are required to form a polygon, the function checks if the count of each stick length divided by 4 (since a polygon with 4 sides is a square, the largest common polygon) is non-zero.
5. **Summing Up**: It sums up the integer division of the counts by 4 for all stick lengths to get the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.

### Analysis:

- The logic for counting the frequencies and determining the number of polygons is correct.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks.
- The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Correctness:

**True**
