Output State: **`zero` remains unchanged, `one` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (previous_i + 2)), `one_perc` remains unchanged, `lst` remains unchanged, `i` is `previous_i + 2`, `one_perc` is updated to math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `one_perc` based on the new value of `i`. The value of `i` is set to `previous_i + 2`. The other variables (`zero`, `zero_perc`, `one`, `one_perc`, `lst`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `one_perc` is calculated using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
