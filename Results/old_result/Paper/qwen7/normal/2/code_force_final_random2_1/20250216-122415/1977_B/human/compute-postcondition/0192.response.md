Output State: **`i` is 30; `length` must be greater than 30; `s[29]` is '-1'**

Explanation: The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the character at index `i - 1` in the string `s` to be `'-'1'`. Given that `i` is 30, `i - 1` is 29. Therefore, `s[29]` is now `'-'1'`. The values of `i`, `length`, and the condition about `length` remain unchanged.
