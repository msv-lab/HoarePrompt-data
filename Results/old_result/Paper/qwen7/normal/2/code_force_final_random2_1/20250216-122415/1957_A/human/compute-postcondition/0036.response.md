Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`.**

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `palka` will be empty because the loop iterates over its elements, and once all elements are processed, `palka` becomes empty.
- The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered, as each new element is appended to `pl` only if it is not already present.
- The dictionary `d` will map each unique element from `palka` to the number of times it appears in `palka`. Each element's count is incremented every time it is encountered in the loop.
