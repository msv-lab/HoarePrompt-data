Postcondition: **`pairs_in_D` and `C[in_aa]` are adjusted according to the condition. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1 and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `fnd` and `pairs_in_D` are adjusted accordingly. `D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, and `E[out_aa]` may be updated according to the condition. `in_aa` will be the next element in `aa[m:]`, and `out_aa` will be the corresponding element in `aa[:n - m]`.**
