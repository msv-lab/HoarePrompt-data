Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, including the sum of the last `k` elements if they are not fully covered by previous sums, `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, and `costs` remains a list of `n` elements. The variable `i` is set to `len(costs) - k`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, starting from the beginning up to the end of the list. If the last group of elements does not form a complete set of `k`, their sum will still be included in `total_costs`. The `rows` and `costs` lists remain unchanged, and the loop index `i` is set to `len(costs) - k`.
