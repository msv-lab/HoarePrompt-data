Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input.**

The code `rem = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `rem`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `rem` now explicitly set to 0.
