Output State: **`h` is 2, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `k` is 1, `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * 2`, `a + c + 2d`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given that `k` is 1 and `h` is 2, the expression simplifies to `a + 1 * c + d * 2`, which further simplifies to `a + c + 2d`. The list `li` originally contained the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to 2, which means it had the values `a + d * 0`, `a + d * 1`, and `a + d * 2`, i.e., `a`, `a + d`, and `a + 2d`. After appending `a + c + 2d`, the list now contains `a`, `a + d`, `a + 2d`, and `a + c + 2d`. However, since the initial state only mentions the range and the specific values for `h` up to 2, we keep the simplified form for the list as `a + d * 2` and `a + c + 2d`. The values of `h`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
