Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variables involved in this loop head are `t` and the loop variable `_`. However, since `_` is an underscore (a common practice for a variable that is not used within the loop), it does not affect the state of the program. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be considered is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`.
   - `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list.
   - `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines.
   - `index` is 4.
   - `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list.
   - `path` is the string from the fourth line of the `data` list.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list, it will be decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

5. **New State**: After the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1. Therefore, `t` is now `t - 1`.

Given these steps, the new state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`results` is now a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus 1, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 4, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, `path` is the string from the fourth line of the `data` list**.
