Output State: **`t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `c` is `m - y1`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y1` is either `r[3] + 1` or `r[3] - 1`, `y2` is `m`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`.**

Explanation: The code `c = m - y1` assigns the value of `m - y1` to the variable `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions regarding the relationships between `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` are still valid.
