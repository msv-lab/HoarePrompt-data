Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1()` call, `n` is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ n[0] ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ n[1] < 2^30; `x` is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ x[0] ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x[1] < 2^30.**

Explanation: The code `a = func_1()` assigns the return value of the function `func_1()` to the variable `a`. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state as no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet.
