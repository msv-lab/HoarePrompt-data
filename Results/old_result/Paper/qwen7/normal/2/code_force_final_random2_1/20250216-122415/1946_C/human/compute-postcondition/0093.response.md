Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` and `R` are adjusted such that `R - L > 1`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `R` is equal to `x`**.

This means that the value of `R` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated values.
