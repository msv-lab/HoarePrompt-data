Output State: **`i` is 'E', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 'E', and `p` is still 'ABCDEF'. The values of `n` and `m` are now integers based on the input provided by the user.
