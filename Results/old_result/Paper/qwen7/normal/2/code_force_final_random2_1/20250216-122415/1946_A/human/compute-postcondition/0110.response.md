Postcondition: **`op` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3, `ma` is the index of `b` increased by 1, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma]`, `b` is explicitly sorted again (remains the same), `i` is `num`, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `a` is updated to contain integers from `case` split and filtered, `median` is reassigned to `b[ma]`.**

This means that regardless of whether `num2` is greater than 10000 or not, after executing the if-else block, the following conditions hold true:
- The variable `op` will be 3.
- The list `a` will contain integers from the split and filtered `case` string.
- The list `b` will be sorted with each element increased by 3.
- The variable `ma` will be the index of `b` increased by 1.
- The `new_median` will be the value of `b[ma]`.
- The `median` will be reassigned to `b[ma]`.
- The list `b` will be explicitly sorted again (remaining the same).
- The variable `i` will remain unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
- The `num2` and `num` will remain as input values.
- The `case` string will remain unchanged.
- The list `a` will be updated to contain integers from `case` split and filtered.
- The `median` will be reassigned to `b[ma]`.
