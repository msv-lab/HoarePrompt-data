Output State: **`k` is an integer, if `b[i + 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `k` is `k - 2`, and `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i + 1], b[i + 1]]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged; `ans1` now contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i]` to `ans1`. The conditions related to `k` and `ans1` remain the same as before, but now `ans1` includes the new element `b[i]`. The value of `k` and the conditions for its change are preserved, and the updated state of `ans1` is included in the output state.
