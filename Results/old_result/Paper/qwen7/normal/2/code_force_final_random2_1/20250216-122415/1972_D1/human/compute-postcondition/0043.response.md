Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `b + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `b + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` must be at least `1` and greater than or equal to `i + 1`.
   - `i` is `i + 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.
   - `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its previous value.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by `1` at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `b` must still satisfy the condition `b >= i + 1`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- The value of `i` will be incremented by `1` from its previous value.
- `b` must still be at least `i + 1` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`b` must be at least `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its previous value.**
