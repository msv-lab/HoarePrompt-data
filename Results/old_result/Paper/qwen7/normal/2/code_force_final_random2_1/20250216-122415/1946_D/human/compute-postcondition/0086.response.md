Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element; `op` is 0; `ai` is unchanged; `val` is unchanged; `t` is a list containing the element `ai`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the element `ai` to the list `t`. The values of `a`, `op`, `ai`, and `val` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` now contains `ai` as its first (and only) element since `t` was initially empty.
