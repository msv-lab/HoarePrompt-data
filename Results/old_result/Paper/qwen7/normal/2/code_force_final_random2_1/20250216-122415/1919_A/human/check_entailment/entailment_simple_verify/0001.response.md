### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b` for each case.

2. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even using the condition `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Bob".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

3. **Game Logic:**
   - The key observation is that the game essentially boils down to determining who will be the last player to make a move.
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure he is the one to make the last move.
   - Conversely, if the absolute difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even difference, ensuring she is the one to make the last move.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the examples provided in the problem description:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `1 1`
  - After Alice's move: `a = 0, b = 1`
  - After Bob's move: `a = 0, b = 0`
  - Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins.
  - Output: `Bob`

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `1 4`
  - After Alice's move: `a = 3, b = 1`
  - After Bob's move: `a = 1, b = 2`
  - After Alice's move: `a = 0, b = 2`
  - After Bob's move: `a = 0, b = 1`
  - After Alice's move: `a = 0, b = 0`
  - Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.
  - Output: `Alice`

The annotated code also confirms that the program processes each test case correctly and prints the appropriate winner based on the absolute difference being even or odd.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given problem description and the optimal strategy.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
