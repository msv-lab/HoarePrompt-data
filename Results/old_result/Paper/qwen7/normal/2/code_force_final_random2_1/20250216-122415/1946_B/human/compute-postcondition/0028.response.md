Output State: **`ans` is (((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD`), `t` is the maximum value that `tmp` ever reached during the loop execution, and `tmp` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. The value of `t` remains the maximum value that `tmp` ever reached during the loop execution, and `tmp` remains 0. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.
