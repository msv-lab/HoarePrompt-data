Reasoning:
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is designed to process a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, but this does not match the problem description at all. The problem requires finding the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse occurs, based on periodicities, not processing a string of characters.
- `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases, but it calls `func_1` for each test case, which is incorrect based on the problem requirements.
- The problem requires calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, not processing a string of characters as `func_1` attempts to do.
- Given the mismatch between the problem requirements and the functions provided, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
