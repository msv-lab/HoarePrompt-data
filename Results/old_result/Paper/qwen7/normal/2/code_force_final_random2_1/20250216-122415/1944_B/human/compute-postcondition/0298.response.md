Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - The length of list `l` is either 1, 2, or 3
   - `k` equals 0

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 2 and the loop condition is `i < n - 1`, the next value of `i` would be 3 if `n` is greater than 4.
   - The length of list `l` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3 (assuming `n` is greater than 4).
   - The length of list `l` remains either 1, 2, or 3.
   - `k` remains 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, the length of list `l` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `k` equals 0**
