Postcondition: `t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1, `suma` is `x + (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`, `i` is 3, `x` is (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3, if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true, `suma` is updated to `x + (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`.
