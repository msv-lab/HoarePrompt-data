Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop variable, often used when the loop variable is not needed), and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. This means that the loop will execute until the user inputs a non-positive number.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `m` will be 0
   - `a` will be the initial value of `a` minus twice the number of iterations
   - `b` will be the initial value of `b`
   - `s` will be the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1`
   - `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `c` for each iteration of the loop

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the user must input a positive number.
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the states directly.
   - The state of `m` will still be 0.
   - The state of `a` will decrease by 2 because it is the initial value minus twice the number of iterations (current number of iterations + 1).
   - The state of `b` remains the same.
   - The state of `s` will be updated to the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1` (since `b` remains unchanged).

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `m` will still be 0.
- `a` will be the initial value of `a` minus twice the current number of iterations minus 2 (i.e., the initial value minus twice the number of iterations plus 2).
- `b` will remain the same.
- `s` will be the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` is 0, `a` is the initial value of `a` minus twice the number of iterations plus 2, `b` is the initial value of `b`, `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1`**.
