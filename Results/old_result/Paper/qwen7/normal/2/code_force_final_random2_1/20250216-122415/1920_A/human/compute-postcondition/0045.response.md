Postcondition: **`innerLoop` is the total number of iterations, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the values from the last input, `big` contains all the values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all the values of `a` where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all the values of `a` where `x` was any other value; `num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. The value of `num` is less than 1**.
