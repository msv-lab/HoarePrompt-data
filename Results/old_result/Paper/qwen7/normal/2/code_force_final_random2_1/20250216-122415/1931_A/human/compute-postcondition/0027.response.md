Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is either 0 or within the range [-26, 52]; `arr` is a list containing the elements 26, 26**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Given the initial conditions, `lex` was either less than 27 or within the range [26, 78]. After subtracting 26, `lex` would now be either 0 (if it was initially 26) or within the range [-26, 52] (if it was initially within the range [26, 78]). The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
