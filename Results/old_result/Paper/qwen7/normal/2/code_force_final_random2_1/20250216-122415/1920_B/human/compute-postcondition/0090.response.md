Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `k` is a non-negative integer. If `i` is 0, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]` and `ans` contains one element which is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]` and `ans` contains `[sums + a[1]]`.
