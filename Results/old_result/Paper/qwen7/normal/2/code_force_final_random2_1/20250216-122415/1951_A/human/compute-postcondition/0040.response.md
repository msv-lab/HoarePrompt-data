Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer minus 2, so `t` could be any integer starting from 0 (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ...).
- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `s` is the new input string from the user.
- `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`.

The `print('YES')` statement directly prints the string 'YES' without referencing any of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
