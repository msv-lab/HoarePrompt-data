Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a non-empty array with at least one less element (excluding the first element).
- `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
- `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`.
- The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is incremented by 1.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the following statement:

```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

Let's break it down:

1. `num` is a variable whose value is not explicitly provided, but it is used in the calculation of `mod_y` and `mod_x`.
2. `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
3. `required_mod_y` is set to `mod_y`, so `required_mod_y` is also the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
4. `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
5. `required_mod_x` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is not defined in this context.

Given these points, the print statement will output:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [num % x], mod_y: [num % y], required_mod_x: [not defined], required_mod_y: [num % y]**
