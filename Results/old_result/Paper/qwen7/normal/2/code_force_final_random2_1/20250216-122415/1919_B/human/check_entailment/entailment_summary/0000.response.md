Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Problem Requirement**: The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` and calculating the penalty for each subarray.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: For each subarray, the penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length.
3. **Optimal Splitting**: The optimal strategy involves splitting the array at points where the sum of the subarray changes sign (from positive to negative or vice versa), because this minimizes the penalty.

However, the provided code simply counts the number of '+' characters and calculates the difference between the total length and the count of '+' characters. This approach does not account for the actual values of the elements (1 or -1) or the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1` only counts the number of '+' characters and calculates the difference between the total length and this count, which is not a correct approach to solving the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
