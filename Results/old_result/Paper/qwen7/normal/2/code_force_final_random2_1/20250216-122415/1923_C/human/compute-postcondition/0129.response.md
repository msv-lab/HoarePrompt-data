Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l` minus the element at index `a-2` in list `p`.**

Explanation: The code `s -= p[a - 2]` subtracts the value of `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Here, `p[a - 2]` is the cumulative sum of the first `a-1` elements in list `l`. Since `s` was initially the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l`, after executing the code, `s` becomes the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements minus the cumulative sum of the first `a-1` elements in `l`.
