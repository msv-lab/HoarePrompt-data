Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 4 since it is twice its original value and is currently less than `k`.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
