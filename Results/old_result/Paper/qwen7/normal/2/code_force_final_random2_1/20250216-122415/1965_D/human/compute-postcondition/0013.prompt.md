You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList is a list of integers representing the complete list of subarray sums of the palindrome array a, and smallList is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a, with the last element of bigList being the same as the last element of smallList.
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State: Output State: `bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers with its last three elements removed.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, both `bigList` and `smallList` will have had their last two and three elements, respectively, removed. This means that `bigList` will have been shortened by two elements from its original length, and `smallList` will have been shortened by three elements from its original length.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the second last element of the original bigList
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, bigList and smallList. bigList is a list of integers representing the complete list of subarray sums of the palindrome array a, and smallList is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a, with the last element of bigList being the same as the last element of smallList. The function returns the second last element of the original bigList.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the second last element of the original bigList


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
