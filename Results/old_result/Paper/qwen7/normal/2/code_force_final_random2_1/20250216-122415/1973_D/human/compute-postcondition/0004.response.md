Output State: **`v` is the return value of `func_2()`, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`**

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_2()` to `v`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it must be at least 1, and `k` retains its original value as it is the return value of `func_3()`.
