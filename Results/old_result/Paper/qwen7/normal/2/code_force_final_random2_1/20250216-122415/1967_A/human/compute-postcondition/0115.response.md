Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is unchanged, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`, and `i + 1` is 2. So, `r` becomes `a[1] + k // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
