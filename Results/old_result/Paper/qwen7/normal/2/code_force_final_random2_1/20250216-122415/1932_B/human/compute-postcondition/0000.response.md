Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs, and the following line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n` such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs; the function `input` is replaced with `sys.stdin.read`.**

The code replaces the standard input reading method with `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input from standard input as a single string. However, it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list of integers `a_i`. Therefore, these values remain as described in the initial state.
