Output State: **`ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`, `hmp` must contain the character 'F', `i` is the next key in `hmp`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `m - hmp[i]`. Since `hmp` must contain the character 'F' and `i` is the next key in `hmp`, these conditions remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated based on the subtraction of `hmp[i]` from `m`.
