Output State: **`min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`, `res`, and `i`; `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, 0)`, `n` is greater than 0, and `res` is not equal to '<'.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `min_indices`. Initially, `min_indices` contains `max_index` and `res`. After appending `i`, `min_indices` now contains `max_index`, `res`, and `i`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
