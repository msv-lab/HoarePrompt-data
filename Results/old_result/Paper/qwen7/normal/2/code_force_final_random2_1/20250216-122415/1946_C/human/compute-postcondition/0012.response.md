Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to focus on adjusting the states of `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(n - 1):` will execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `x` is 1
   - `R` is 100001
   - `z` is 0
   - `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input
   - `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the element at index `a` which now contains `[b, a]` and `[b]`
   - `a` is the first integer from the input
   - `b` is the second integer from the input
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is the same as before
   - `adj[b].append(a)` has been executed

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as before.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `t` remains unchanged: \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `x` remains unchanged: 1
   - `R` remains unchanged: 100001
   - `z` remains unchanged: 0
   - `k` remains unchanged: integer from the second space-separated input
   - `adj` remains unchanged: list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the element at index `a` which now contains `[b, a]` and `[b]`
   - `a` remains unchanged: first integer from the input
   - `b` remains unchanged: second integer from the input
   - `i` is now 4
   - `n` remains the same as before

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the element at index `a` which now contains `[b, a]` and `[b]`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 4, `n` is the same as before**
