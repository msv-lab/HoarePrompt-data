Output State: `i` is 1, `k` is 2, `permutation` is a list where the elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (i.e., 2, 4, 6, 8, ...) are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2 up to the length of the list, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 + 1` which is `len(permutation) + 7`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 3 * k + 3 * 3` which is 10, `len(permutation)` is at least 13, and `permutation[9]` is `len(permutation) + 7`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `k` remains 2, and `i` remains 1 as per the given loop condition and updates. The `permutation` list will have its elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc.) filled with consecutive integers starting from 2 up to the length of the list. The `curr_v` value will be `len(permutation) + 7` because it increments by 1 each time the loop runs and `k` is 2. The `multiples_of_k_plus_i` value will be 10 since it starts at `1 + 3 * k` and increments by `k` each iteration, and the loop runs until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than the length of the `permutation` list. Given that the initial `len(permutation)` is at least 10 and considering the loop's effect, the minimum `len(permutation)` after all iterations would be 13, making `permutation[9]` the last updated element with the value `len(permutation) + 7`.
