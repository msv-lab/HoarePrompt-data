Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `check_all` is the result of the all function checking if each element in the list `a` from index 1 to n-1 is less than or equal to the next element, `i` is equal to `n`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, and `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `new` is a list containing elements from `a[1:]`. If `a[0] >= new[i]` for all `i` in the range of the length of `new` and `(new[i - 1] <= new[i])` holds for all consecutive elements in `new`, we break out of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `new` is a list containing elements from `a[2:]`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i-1])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`, `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i-1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]), and in both cases (whether the condition `check_all_new and new_all` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `new` is a list containing elements from `a[3:]`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`, `new_all` is updated to `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken if `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
