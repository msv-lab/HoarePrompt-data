Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is defined as `mak + 2`.
   - `mak` is defined as `mak + 1`. This means `mak` is incremented by 1 from whatever its previous value was.
   - `len(pans)` must be greater than `mak + 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

Given the initial state:
- Since `mak` is `mak + 1`, it implies that `mak` is one more than its previous value.
- `i` is `mak + 2`, so `i` is two more than the new value of `mak`.

Since `len(pans)` must be greater than `mak + 2`, it means there are at least `mak + 3` elements in the list `pans`.

The print statement will output:
- `'?'`
- `pans[mak]` (which is the element at the index `mak` in the list `pans`)
- `pans[mak]` (repeated)
- `pans[i]` (which is the element at the index `i` in the list `pans`)
- `pans[i]` (repeated)

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]'**
