Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2()` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `func_2()` is called, but since `func_2()` does not have a defined implementation, its exact effect on the variables cannot be determined. However, the call itself does not change the values of the existing variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `cnt`, and `l`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the only thing that happens is the execution of the function `func_2()`.
