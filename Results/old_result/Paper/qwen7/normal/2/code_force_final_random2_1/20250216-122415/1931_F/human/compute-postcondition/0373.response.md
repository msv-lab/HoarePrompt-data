Output State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `i` is 0, `idx2` is 0, the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` are not equal to the elements at index `i + p2` in list `l2`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.**

The code `p2 = 1` updates the value of `p2` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions involving `l1`, `l2`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain the same as they were initially.
