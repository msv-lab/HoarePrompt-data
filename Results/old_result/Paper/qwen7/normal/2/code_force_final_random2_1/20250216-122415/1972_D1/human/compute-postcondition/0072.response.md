Output State: `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the maximum value of `i` that satisfies the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b`, and `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated for each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

In this final state, `a` remains unchanged as it is initialized from `info[0]`. The variable `b` will be the largest integer such that `a - b * (b - 1) > 0`. The variable `i` will be one more than this value because the loop increments `i` until the condition fails. `x` is recalculated based on the final value of `i` and added to `suma` if the condition is still satisfied. If the condition is no longer satisfied, `x` is not added to `suma`.
