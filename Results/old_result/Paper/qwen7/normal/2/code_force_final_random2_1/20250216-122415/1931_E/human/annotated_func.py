#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of integers in the list, m is an integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins, and nums is a list of integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each a_i in nums.

    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))

        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `2 * len(cntvals)`, `tot` is `tot - (sum of all elements in cntvals)`. 
    #
    #In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to twice the length of `cntvals`, meaning it has incremented by 2 for each iteration until it reaches or exceeds the length of `cntvals`. The variable `tot` will be reduced by the sum of all values in `cntvals`, as each value in `cntvals` from index 0 to the last index is subtracted in each iteration of the loop.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the value of `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of integers in the list), `m` (a parameter determining when Sasha wins), and `nums` (a list of integers). It first checks if `n` is 1, returning 'Sasha' if the length of the string representation of the minimum between 1 and its reverse is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'. If `n` is not 1, it calculates the total length of the string representations of the numbers in `nums`, sorts the count of zeros in each number in descending order, and adjusts the total based on these counts. Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the adjusted total is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, representing an element in the list that Anna or Sasha manipulates during their turns.
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        
        tot += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is less than 0, `tot` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in `num`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `i` until it encounters a digit that is not '0' or it has iterated through the entire string `num`. The variable `tot` keeps a count of how many trailing zeros the string `num` has. Once `i` becomes less than 0, the loop terminates, and `tot` will hold the total count of trailing zeros in `num`.
    return tot
    #The program returns the total count of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer 'num', which is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `num` between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive and returns the total count of trailing zeros in its string representation.
