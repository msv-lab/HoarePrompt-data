Output State: **`k` is equal to `req` - 6, `i` is 5, `n` is greater than 1, `ans2` contains the values of `c[1]`, `c[2]`, `c[3]`, `c[4]`, and `c[5]`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is initially `req - 4`. After executing `k -= 2`, `k` is updated to `req - 6`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
