Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable involved here is `m`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0, meaning `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a3` is the first integer from the input split.
   - `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split.
   - `val` is a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`).
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - The tuple (`a3`, `l3`) has been appended to `val`.

4. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating `m - 2` times, at the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be reduced by 1 (because one iteration has just completed).
   - Therefore, if `m` was initially greater than or equal to 3, it will now be greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3 (i.e., `m` will be 2).

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `a3` remains the same.
   - `l3` remains the same.
   - `val` remains the same.
   - `m` is reduced by 1, so `m` must be 2.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`), `m` must be 2**.
