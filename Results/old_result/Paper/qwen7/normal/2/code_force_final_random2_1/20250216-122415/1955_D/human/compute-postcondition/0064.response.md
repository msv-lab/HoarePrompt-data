Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `E[in_aa]`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, and `pairs_in_D` retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The code `D[in_aa] += 1` increases the value of `D[in_aa]` by 1. The other variables (`C[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `E[in_aa]`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, and `pairs_in_D`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, they retain their previous values.
