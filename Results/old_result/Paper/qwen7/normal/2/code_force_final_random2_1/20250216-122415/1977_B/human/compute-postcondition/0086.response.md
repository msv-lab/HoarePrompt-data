Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `length` must be greater than 1
   - `s[i]` is '0'
   - Additional condition: If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` remains '0'. However, since there is no else part, no other changes occur.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, length):`
   - This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `length - 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `length` remains unchanged (it must still be greater than 1).
   - `s[i]` (which is now `s[2]`) does not change based on the given conditions; it remains '0'.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `length` must be greater than 1
   - `s[2]` is '0'

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `length` must be greater than 1, and `s[2]` is '0'**
