Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains elements popped from `combined` during the loop's iterations if `combined` was not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`. The values of `test_cases`, `t`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` updates the value of `max_profit` to be equal to the current value of `current_profit`. All other variables retain their previous states.
