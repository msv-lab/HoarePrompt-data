Output State: **`idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `val` is an empty list, `a1` is inserted at index `n-2` in list `l1`, `l` is `l1`**.

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns the reference of `l1` to `l`. This does not create a new list but rather points `l` to the same list that `l1` points to. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, and the insertion of `a1` at index `n-2` in `l1` remain unchanged.
