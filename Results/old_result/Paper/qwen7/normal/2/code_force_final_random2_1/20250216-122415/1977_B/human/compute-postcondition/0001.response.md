Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `nalla` and the variable `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `nalla` is less than `t`.
3. **Initial state of the variables**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - Other variables remain unchanged.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means that `nalla` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the `range(t)` function) and `t` should be set to its given value.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `nalla` should be 0.
- `t` should be the value of `int(input())`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`nalla` is 0, `t` is the value of `int(input())`**
