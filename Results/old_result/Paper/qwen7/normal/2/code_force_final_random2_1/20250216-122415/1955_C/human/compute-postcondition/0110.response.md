Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `r` is n - 1, `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[r]`, and `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= a[r]` updates the value of `a[l]` by subtracting `a[r]` from it. Given the initial conditions, `l` is equal to `r-1` and `r` is `n-1`, so after executing the code, `a[l]` (which is `a[n-2]`) is updated to `a[n-2] - a[n-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
