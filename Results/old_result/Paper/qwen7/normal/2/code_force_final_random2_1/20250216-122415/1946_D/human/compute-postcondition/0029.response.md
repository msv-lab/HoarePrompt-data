Output State: **`a` is the same list, `val` is the next element in `a`, `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> i & 1`, `ai` is 0, `t` is [0, 0]**.

Explanation: The code `ai = 0` sets the variable `ai` to 0. Since `ai` was previously `ai ^ val`, setting `ai` to 0 implies that `ai` is now 0. The other variables (`a`, `val`, `op`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
