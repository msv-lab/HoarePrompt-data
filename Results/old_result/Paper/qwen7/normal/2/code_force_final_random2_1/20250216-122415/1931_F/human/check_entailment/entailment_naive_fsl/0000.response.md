Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to check if the remaining elements in the lists after removing the author's position are consistent across all screenshots. This can lead to incorrect conclusions about the order of participants.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 4
1 2 3 4
2 3 1 4
3 2 1 4
4 2 3 1
```

The program will incorrectly conclude that there is a consistent order because it only checks the first mismatched element without ensuring the rest of the elements are consistent. However, the correct approach would be to ensure that the remaining elements in the lists after removing the author's position are the same for all screenshots.

To fix this, the program needs to compare the remaining elements in the lists after removing the author's position for all screenshots and ensure they are consistent.
