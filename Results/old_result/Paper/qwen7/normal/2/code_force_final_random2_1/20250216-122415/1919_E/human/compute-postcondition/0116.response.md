Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer within the range 1 to 5000, and `p`, a list of `n` integers where each element's absolute value is less than or equal to `n`. The function returns `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` plus an offset, and `dp[j]` for every index `j` from 1 to 2*n is the cumulative sum of all positive values in the original `dp` list, distributed across its indices from 1 to 2*n through multiple iterations of the loop, modulo `MOD`.**
