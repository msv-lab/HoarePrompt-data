Output State: **`a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 4, `x` is `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4`, `suma` is `suma + x`**

Explanation: The variable `x` is calculated as `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4`, which simplifies to `(a - 12) // 4`. Then, `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its current value. The other variables (`a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
