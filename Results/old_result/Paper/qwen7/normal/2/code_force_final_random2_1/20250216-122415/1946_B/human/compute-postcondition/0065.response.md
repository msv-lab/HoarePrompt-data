Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `t` is equal to `tmp`, and `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code sets `t` to the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`. Since `tmp` is initially 0, `max(tmp, t)` evaluates to 0 (because both `tmp` and `t` are 0). Therefore, `t` remains 0. The values of `tmp` and `x` remain unchanged.
