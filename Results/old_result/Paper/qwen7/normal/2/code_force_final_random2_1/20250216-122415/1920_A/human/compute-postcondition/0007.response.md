State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` must be 0**.

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `iterable2` is initialized to 0 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop (which is controlled by `innerLoop`). Therefore, `iterable2` must be 0 when the loop starts its first iteration.
- The loop condition `range(innerLoop)` means that the loop will execute as long as `innerLoop` is greater than 0. Since `innerLoop` is an input integer and must be at least 1, we need to ensure that `innerLoop` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `innerLoop` and `iterable2`.
