Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is 5, `n` must be at least 5, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`, and `c` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `l[5] > a and l[5] > b` is true or false. If the condition `l[5] > a and l[5] > b` is true, then `a` remains the first element of the list `l`. Otherwise, `a` becomes the first element of the list `l`.
