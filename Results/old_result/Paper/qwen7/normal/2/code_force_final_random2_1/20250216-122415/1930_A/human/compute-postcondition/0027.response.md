Output State: **`suma` is 0, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings sorted in ascending order except for the first element which is now the integer `a`, `a` is the first element of `numbers` converted to an integer, `b` is the last element processed (if any)**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `a`. The precondition that `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings sorted in ascending order remains valid, but now the first element is no longer in the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
