Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `row` representing the depths of river cells in a single row and an integer `d` representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
   - It increments the last element of `row` by 2 and all other elements by 1.
   - For the first `d-1` elements, it increments them by 1 again.
   - The function returns the last element of the modified `row`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` takes four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and a list of `n` lists `rows` where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells.
   - It uses `func_1` to calculate the cost of installing supports for each row.
   - It then calculates the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the list of costs.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum sum among these calculated values.

3. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid, minimizing the total cost of installing supports.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the cost of installing supports for a single row by ensuring the required conditions are met.
   - The function `func_2` correctly applies `func_1` to each row, calculates the total cost for each possible group of `k` consecutive rows, and finds the minimum total cost.

Given the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
