Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed.
   - `smallList` is a list of integers with the last element removed.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition involves two parts: `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.
   - Since `smallList` has the last element removed, `len(smallList)` is not zero, meaning the first part of the condition (`len(smallList) > 0`) is already satisfied.
   - For the second part (`bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`), the last elements of both lists must be equal for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `bigList` must have an element at the end that matches the last element of `smallList`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the last element of `bigList` to match the last element of `smallList`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element that matches the last element of `smallList`, and `smallList` is a list of integers with the last element removed**.
