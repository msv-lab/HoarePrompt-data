Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is an input string, and if `r` equals '>', then `prev` is set to 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or conditions. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered data is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or conditions are altered, the initial state remains unchanged.
