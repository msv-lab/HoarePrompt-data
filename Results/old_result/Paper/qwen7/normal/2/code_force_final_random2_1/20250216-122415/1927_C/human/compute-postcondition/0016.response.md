Output State: **`results` is a list containing 'NO', `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a` and its length is greater than `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of `results`, `only_b`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
