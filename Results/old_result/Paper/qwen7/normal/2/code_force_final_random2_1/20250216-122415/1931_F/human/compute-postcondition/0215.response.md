Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both `i`, and `p1` and `p2` are both 0. Otherwise, `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `-1`, or `idx1` is `-1` and `idx2` is `i`, and `p1` is 1 and `p2` is 0, or `p1` is 0 and `p2` is 1. Additionally, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
