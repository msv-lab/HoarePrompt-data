Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `arr` is a sorted list of integers where the last element is `lex` and the rest of the elements are either 0 or 1, with the total count of 1s being equal to the number of cases. `j` is 1 for all sublists in `arr`. `info` is a list containing the results of all iterations, with each sublist sorted and having the same structure as described above. The length of `info` is equal to the value of `cases`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `arr` will contain a series of lists, each sorted, with the last element being the final value of `lex` for that iteration, and the preceding elements being either 0s or 1s based on the logic inside the loop. The `info` list will hold all these results, maintaining the order of the iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    temp = ''
    for j in range(3):
        temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
    print(temp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 3, `cases` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[3][2] + 96` for each iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 3 (since the loop runs for 3 iterations and `i` starts from 0), `cases` will still need to be greater than 0, `j` will be 2 (the last value it takes in the loop), and `temp` will be a string consisting of the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[3][2] + 96` for each of the three iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 5, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 'aaa', `j` is 3.

Explanation: The loop runs for 3 iterations as given. After each iteration, `j` increments and the `temp` string concatenates with the next character in the sequence. Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop runs 3 times, it will eventually reach 3. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` remains 5 (since it increments by 1 after the loop starts), `cases` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged), `temp` will be 'aaa' (after 3 iterations of appending characters), and `j` will be 3 (the final value after the last iteration).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 7, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to 'chr(info[6][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][4] + 96)', `j` is 4.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` remains 7 because the loop does not change the value of `i`. The variable `cases` must still be greater than 0 as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `temp` contains the concatenated result of converting characters from the `info` list based on the specified indices and additions, and `j` is now 4 because the loop ran for 3 iterations, incrementing `j` from 0 to 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
