Postcondition: `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `n-2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` (where `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`), and `m` is `n-1` minus 1, and `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)` if `a1` is inserted, otherwise `l3.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)`.
