The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the value of \( ans \) as \( n \) plus the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each integer \( b \) from 2 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \). After processing all test cases, it prints the result \( ans \) for each test case.
