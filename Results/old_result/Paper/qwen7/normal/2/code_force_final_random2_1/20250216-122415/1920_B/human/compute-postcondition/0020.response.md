Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, and `k` is a non-negative integer. If `i` is 0, then `ans` contains the value `sums`, where `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is 1, then `ans` contains either `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[0]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`.
