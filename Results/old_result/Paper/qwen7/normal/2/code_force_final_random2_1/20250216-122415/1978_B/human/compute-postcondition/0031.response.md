Output State: The final value of `max_profit` will be the highest profit found during the entire binary search process. This means that after all iterations of the loop, `max_profit` will hold the maximum profit that can be achieved based on the conditions provided by the function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for all possible values of `mid` within the range defined by `low` and `high`.

In more detail, the loop continues to narrow down the range of `mid` values through binary search until `low` exceeds `high`. During each iteration, it calculates the profit for the current `mid` and the next value (`mid + 1`). It updates `max_profit` with the higher of these two profits and adjusts the search range based on whether the profit increases or decreases as `mid` increases. Once the loop completes, `max_profit` reflects the best possible outcome across all iterations.
