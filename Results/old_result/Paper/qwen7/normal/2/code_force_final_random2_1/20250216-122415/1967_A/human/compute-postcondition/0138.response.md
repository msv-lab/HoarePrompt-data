Let's break down the initial state and the expression to be evaluated:

1. `ii` is 2.
2. `n` must be greater than 1.
3. `k` is 0.
4. `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + 0 // n`. Since `n > 1`, `0 // n` is 0, so `r = a[n - 1] + 0 = a[n - 1]`.
5. `rem` is 0.
6. `y` is `n - 1 - (n - 1)`, which simplifies to `y = 0`.
7. `k` is not equal to 0, but this is contradictory to the earlier statement that `k` is 0. We'll assume the earlier statement is correct since it's explicitly defined.

Given these points, let's focus on the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`:

- `r` is `a[n - 1]`.
- Since `n > 1`, `n - 1` is a valid index for the list `a`.
- The expression becomes `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1`.

However, the value of `a[n - 1]` is not explicitly provided. Since we need to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information, we will express the result in terms of `a[n - 1]`.

Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1**
