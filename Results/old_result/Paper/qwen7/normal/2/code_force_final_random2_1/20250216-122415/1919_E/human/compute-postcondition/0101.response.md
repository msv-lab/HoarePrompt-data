Output State: **`new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) filled with zeros, `dp` is defined, `j` is \(k + 2\), `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding the value of `dp[j]` to it and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
