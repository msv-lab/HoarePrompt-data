Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state only mentions that `n` is assigned the value of an integer input, so the output state is that `n` is an input integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which is not specified beyond `n`.
