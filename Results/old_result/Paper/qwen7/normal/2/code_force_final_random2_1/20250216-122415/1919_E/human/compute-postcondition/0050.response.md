Output State: **For every index `j` from 1 to \(2 * n\), `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\).**

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`. This operation is performed for every `j` from 1 to \(2 * n\). The initial condition that `new_dp[j]` is the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0`, modulo `MOD`, remains unchanged. The value of `i` is `m + 1`, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to 0. After executing the code, the new state of `new_dp` is as described.
