You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100, and b is a list of integers representing the values n_i where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list 'a'
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list 'b' which consists of integers between 1 and 100, where each integer in list 'b' is less than or equal to 100 and the list 'a' (which is not returned but known to be strictly greater than 'b') contains integers in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of integers in strictly increasing order where each integer is between 1 and 100, and `b` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100. Depending on the conditions, the function returns either a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, or it returns the list `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list 'a'

Case_2: The program returns the list 'b' which consists of integers between 1 and 100, where each integer in list 'b' is less than or equal to 100 and the list 'a' (which is not returned but known to be strictly greater than 'b') contains integers in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
