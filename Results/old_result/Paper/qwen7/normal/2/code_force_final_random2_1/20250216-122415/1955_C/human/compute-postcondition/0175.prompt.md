Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `r` is set to n - 2, `sunks` is set to 2, `a[l]` is set to 0, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, then if `a[r]` is exactly `k / 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `r` is now `n-2`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and either `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[r]` and `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, or `k` is 0 or `a[r] * 2 == k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range 1 to \(n\), `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the conditions (`l` is `r-2` or `r-1`, `r` is `n-3` or `n-2`), `sunks` is increased by 1 or 2, `k` remains unchanged or is reduced by \(2 * a[n-3]\), and `a[r]` is modified based on the conditions (reduced by `a[l]` or `2 * a[l]`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
