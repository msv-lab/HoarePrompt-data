### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided example.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` (number of coins) and `k` (number of jewels).

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: \( n = k \)**:
     - The program correctly prints "YES" and outputs 1 stall with a price of 1 coin. This ensures Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels since she spends all her coins.
   - **Case 2: \( n < k \)**:
     - The program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy \( k \) jewels with fewer coins.
   - **Case 3: \( n \geq k \)**:
     - The program attempts to find a way to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels by setting up stalls with specific prices.
     - It calculates the number of stalls needed and their respective prices using the logic in the loop.
     - However, the logic in the loop is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `curr` and the subsequent updates to `n` and `h` do not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly \( k \) jewels.

### Detailed Analysis of the Loop Logic:

- **Loop Logic**:
  ```python
  costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
  h = 0
  for i in costs:
      curr = n // i
      h += curr
      n -= i * curr
  ```
  - Here, `costs` is initialized with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
  - The loop iterates over these two values, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy at each price and updating `h` and `n` accordingly.
  - The issue arises because the loop only considers the first two values in `costs`, and the logic does not account for the possibility of buying exactly \( k \) jewels across multiple stalls.

### Example Test Case Analysis:

- **Test Case 1: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 3 \)**:
  - The program correctly prints "YES" and outputs 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, ensuring Alice buys exactly 3 jewels.

- **Test Case 2: \( n = 6 \), \( k = 4 \)**:
  - The program incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not consider the possibility of setting up more than one stall to achieve the desired outcome.

- **Test Case 3: \( n = 255 \), \( k = 8 \)**:
  - The program incorrectly prints "YES" and outputs 2 stalls with prices 128 and 64, but this does not ensure Alice buys exactly 8 jewels. The logic fails to distribute the purchases correctly across multiple stalls.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly handle the case where \( n \geq k \) and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly \( k \) jewels. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
