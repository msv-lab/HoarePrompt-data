Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list comprehension that converts the last element of `arr` (at index `i-1`) to a string, iterates over each character in that string, converting each character to an integer, and adds those integers to a new list. It then appends the current element of `arr` (at index `i`) to this list. Since `i` is 0 initially, `arr[i-1]` would refer to the last element of `arr` (if `arr` has more than one element), and `arr[i]` refers to the first element of `arr`. Therefore, `nums` will contain the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the first element of `arr`.
