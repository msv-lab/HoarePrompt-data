Output State: **`palka` has at least one element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, `pl` has the element `i` appended, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `pl`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` is the first element in `palka`, `palka` still has at least one element. If `i` was already present in `pl`, then `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` was not in `pl`, no changes occur to `d`.
