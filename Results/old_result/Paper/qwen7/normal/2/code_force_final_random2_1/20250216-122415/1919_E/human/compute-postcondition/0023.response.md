Output State: **`index` is 6 + 2n, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result, `p` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `p` by converting the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers using `map(int, ...)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
