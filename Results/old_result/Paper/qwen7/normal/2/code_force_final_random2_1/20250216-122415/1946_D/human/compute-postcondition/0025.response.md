Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for val in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `val` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body Effects**: The loop body updates the variable `op` by performing a bitwise XOR assignment (`^=`) with `val >> i & 1`. It also sets `ai` to 0 and `t` to `[0]`. However, since there is no else part, the conditions remain as specified in the if part.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> i & 1`.
   - `ai` is 0.
   - `t` is `[0]`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop body does not change `a` or `val` directly, the value of `a` remains the same.
   - `val` will be the next element in the list `a` for the next iteration.
   - `op` will be updated based on the new `val` during the next iteration.
   - `ai` will be set to 0.
   - `t` will be set to `[0]`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `val` becomes the next element in `a`.
   - `op` is updated based on the new `val`.
   - `ai` is 0.
   - `t` is `[0]`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is the same list, `val` is the next element in `a`, `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> i & 1`, `ai` is 0, `t` is [0]**.
