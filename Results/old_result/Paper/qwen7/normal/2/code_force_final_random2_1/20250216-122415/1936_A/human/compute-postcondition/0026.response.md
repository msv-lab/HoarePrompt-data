Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- `n` is mentioned to be greater than 0 but no specific value is provided for `n`.

The `mak` and `mak2` variables are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their values from the given information. Therefore, they will be printed as their respective variable names.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Given the values:
- `'?'` is a string literal.
- `mak` is undefined, so it will be printed as `mak`.
- `mak2` is undefined, so it will be printed as `mak2`.
- `i` is 0.
- `mak2` is undefined, so it will be printed as `mak2` again.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **'? mak mak2 0 mak2'**
