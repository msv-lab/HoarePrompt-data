Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `new_median <= median`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `op` is 1
   - `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string
   - `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3
   - `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2
   - `new_median` is `b[ma]`
   - `median` is `b[ma] + 1`
   - `b[ma]` is greater than or equal to 4
   - `b` is explicitly sorted

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on `new_median` and `median`.
   - Given `new_median = b[ma]` and `median = b[ma] + 1`, the loop will continue if `b[ma] <= (b[ma] + 1)`, which is always true.

4. **Check if the loop can certainly execute one more time**:
   - Since `new_median` is always less than or equal to `median` given the current values, the loop cannot be guaranteed to execute one more time based solely on the current values of `new_median` and `median`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to change the value of `new_median` or `median` such that the condition `new_median <= median` no longer holds.
   - One way to achieve this is to increase `new_median` or decrease `median`.

Given the constraints, the most straightforward adjustment would be to increase `new_median` to a value greater than `median`.

**Final State**:
State: **`op` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b[ma]` is greater than or equal to 4; `b` is explicitly sorted.**

This ensures that `new_median > median`, breaking the loop condition and allowing the loop to terminate.
