Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of test cases, followed by \( t \) groups of data. Each group includes a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. For each group, the function sorts the list of integers, finds the smallest positive integer not present in the list, and determines whether this integer is even or odd. Based on this determination, the function prints either "Alice" or "Bob". The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.**
