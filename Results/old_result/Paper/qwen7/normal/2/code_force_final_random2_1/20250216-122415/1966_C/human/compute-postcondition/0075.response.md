Output State: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` is one more than the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the last element of the list `a`, `tc` is `t - 1`, and `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `mexsize` will be incremented once for each element in the list `a`. Since the loop continues as long as `sz` (which iterates through each element in `a`) is equal to `mexsize`, `mexsize` will be incremented until it is one more than the maximum value in the list `a`. The value of `sz` will be the last element in the list `a` after the loop completes, and the other variables (`tc` and `maxsize`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
