Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `cases`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `cases`.

3. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 5
   - `cases` must be greater than 0
   - `temp` is 'aaa'
   - `j` is 3

4. **Adjusting the States for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `cases`.
   - Currently, `i` is 5, and `cases` must be greater than 0.
   - To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 6.
   - `cases` must still be greater than 0.
   - `temp` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 6, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 'aaa', `j` is 3**
