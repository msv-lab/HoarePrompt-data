Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1`, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `aa[m:]` must have at least one element, and `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The value of `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, making it `D[out_aa] - 1`. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
