Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a string containing the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces, where `a` is calculated based on the input values of `n` and the list `T`.**

To elaborate, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be `0` because the loop condition `while t:` will no longer be true once `t` reaches `0`. At this point, the list `a` will contain `n` elements, starting with `1000` and each subsequent element being the difference of the previous element and the corresponding value in the list `T`. Since the loop reverses the list `a` before printing, the output will be a string of these elements in reverse order, separated by spaces.
