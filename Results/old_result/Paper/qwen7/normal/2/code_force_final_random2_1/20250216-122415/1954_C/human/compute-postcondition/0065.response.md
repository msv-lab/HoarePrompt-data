Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to 1.
2. It also states that `len(b)` must be greater than 0, meaning that the list `b` is non-empty.

Given these conditions, we need to determine what `b[i]` will be when the print statement is executed.

- Since `i` is 1, we are accessing the second element of the list `b`.
- Because `len(b)` is greater than 0, the list `b` contains at least one element.

Therefore, `b[i]` refers to the second element of the list `b`.

Output: **b[1]**
