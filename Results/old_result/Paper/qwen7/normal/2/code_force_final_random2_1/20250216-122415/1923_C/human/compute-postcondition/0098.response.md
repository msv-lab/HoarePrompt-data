Output State: **`m` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by subtracting the value of `p[a - 2]` from its current value, which was originally equal to `p[b - 1]`. Therefore, the new value of `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `p` remain unchanged.
