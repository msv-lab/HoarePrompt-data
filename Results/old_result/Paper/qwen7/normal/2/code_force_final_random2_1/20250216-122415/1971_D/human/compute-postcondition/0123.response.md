Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with a length of at least 4, `count` is equal to the length of `s` - 2, `flag` is True, `t` must be greater than 1, `j` is equal to the length of `s` - 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `flag` is True, then `count` is reduced by 1 (from `length of s` - 1 to `length of s` - 2). The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly reflects the if part's outcome.
