Output State: **The program returns a list containing the product of each element in the original list `b` with all the elements that came after it in reverse order.**

This means that if the original list `b` was `[a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`, the resulting list `ans` would contain the products `[a1*an, a2*(an-1)*an, a3*(an-2)*(an-1)*an, ..., an-1*an, an]`. The function `return reversed(ans)` will reverse this list, so the final output will be `[an, an-1*an, ..., a3*(an-2)*(an-1)*an, a2*(an-1)*an, a1*an]`.
