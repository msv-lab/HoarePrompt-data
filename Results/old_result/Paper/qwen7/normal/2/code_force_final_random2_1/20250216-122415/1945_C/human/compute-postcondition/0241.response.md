Output State: **`final` is an empty list, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**

Explanation: The code `c1 = o * 100 // n` assigns the value of `o * 100 // n` to the variable `c1`. The initial state of `final` remains an empty list because no elements are added or removed from it by this line of code. The values of `o` and `n` are used directly in the calculation to determine the value of `c1`.
