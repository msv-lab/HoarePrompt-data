Output State: **`i` is 23, `idx` is 21, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing elements [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` using a list comprehension where each element is calculated as \(1\) left-shifted by `i` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `20`. Since `i` starts from `0`, the first element is \(1 << 0 = 1\), the second element is \(1 << 1 = 2\), and so on, up to \(1 << 20 = 1048576\). The values of `i`, `idx`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
