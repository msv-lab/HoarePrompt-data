You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the square root of n does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^3. Additionally, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values across all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is greater than the square root of `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for each iteration where the gcd of `x` and `y` is 1, starting from `y = 1` until the condition `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` is met, `y` is the last value of `y` that satisfied the conditions in the inner loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be greater than the square root of `n`. The variable `cnt` will hold the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` such that the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true. The value of `y` will be the last value it took during the last iteration of the inner loop before the conditions were no longer satisfied.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the count of valid pairs (x, y) satisfying the given conditions)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the standard input. It then iterates over all pairs of positive integers \( (x, y) \) such that \( x \times x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \times x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \times y \leq m \). For each valid pair, if the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) is 1, it adds the minimum of \( \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \) to a counter. After completing all iterations, it prints the value of the counter, which represents the total count of such valid pairs. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 3\), `_` is 3.
    #
    #Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is effectively decremented by 1 because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. Therefore, after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `t` times), `t` will be `0`. The variable `_` will hold the value of the last iteration index, which is `t - 1`, so it will be `t - 1 = 3` if the loop ran `t` times. Given that the loop can run a maximum of `t` times, and `t` starts at a maximum of \(10^4\), after running `t` times, `t` will be `0`. Thus, `t` is an integer between `0` and \(10^4 - 3\), and `_` is `3`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to \(10^4\) test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1()`. After processing all test cases, it sets `t` to 0 and `_` to 3. The function does not return any value but modifies the variables `t` and `_` based on the number of iterations.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case, and `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one. Given the constraints and the logic used, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly without missing any valid pairs or including invalid ones.
