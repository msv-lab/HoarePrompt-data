Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations), `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `pans = []` initializes `pans` as an empty list. The values of `mak2`, `mak`, `i`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
