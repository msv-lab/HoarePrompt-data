Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `mexsize` is increased by 1**.

The code `mexsize = mexsize + 1` increases the value of `mexsize` by 1. The precondition that `a` must contain at least one element remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated output state is that `a` must contain at least one element and `mexsize` is increased by 1.
