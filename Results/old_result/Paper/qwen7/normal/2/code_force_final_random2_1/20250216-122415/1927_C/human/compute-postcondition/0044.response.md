Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:`. The variables in the loop head are `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more tuples in the `cases` list.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `results` now contains 'NO'.
   - `total_distinct`, `unique_a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, and `both` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over tuples from the `cases` list, at the start of the next iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` will change to the next tuple in the `cases` list.
   - The other variables (`results`, `total_distinct`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, and `both`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The new state should reflect that the loop will use the next tuple from the `cases` list for its variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`results` now contains 'NO', `total_distinct`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, and `both` remain unchanged, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are the next tuple from the `cases` list**.
