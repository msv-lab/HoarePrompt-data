Output State: **`T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `list0`. The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
