Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and 1, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is n-3, `el` is the character at index n-1 in `s1` and is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `zeroInd` as the sum of the last two elements of the `suffZero` list. Since `suffZero` contains only 0 and 1, `zeroInd` will be either 0 (if both last elements are 0) or 1 (if one of the last two elements is 1). The values of other variables remain unchanged.
