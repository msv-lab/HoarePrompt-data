Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `prev` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `r` is a string input from the last iteration, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n`, `v2` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: The line `prev = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
