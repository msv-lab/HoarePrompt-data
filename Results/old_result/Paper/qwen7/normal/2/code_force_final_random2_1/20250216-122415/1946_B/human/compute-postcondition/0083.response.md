Output State: **`i` is 1, `k - 1` must be a positive integer, `t` is 2 % MOD, `ans` is 2 % MOD**

Explanation: The code `ans += t` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `t`. Given that `t` is `2 % MOD`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (2 % MOD)`. Since `ans` was initially `0`, it now becomes `2 % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
