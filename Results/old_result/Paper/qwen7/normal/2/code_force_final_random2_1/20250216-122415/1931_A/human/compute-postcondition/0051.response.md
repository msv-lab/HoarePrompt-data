Output State: **`arr` is [lex, 26], `j` is 1, `lex` is either 0 or within the range [-26, 52]**.

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Initially, `arr` is `[26, lex]`. Since `lex` can be either 0 or within the range [-26, 52], when `lex` is less than 26, it will move to the front of the list, resulting in `[lex, 26]`. If `lex` is 26 or greater, the list remains `[26, lex]`. The value of `j` remains unchanged.
