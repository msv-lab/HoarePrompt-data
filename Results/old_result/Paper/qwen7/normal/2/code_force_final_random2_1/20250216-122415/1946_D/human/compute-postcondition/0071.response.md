Postcondition: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is 0. If `v` is truthy, `a` is a non-empty iterable, `op` is the cumulative result of performing `op ^= val >> i & 1` for every `val` in `a`, `cnt` is the count of how many times `op` turned from 1 to 0 during the loop's execution, `ans` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, `i` is the last bit position checked, `u` is the last value of `op` before it turned from 1 to 0 (if it did), `v` is the last value of `val` processed, and `t` is the last value of `ans` before updating, with `val` being the last element of `a` that was processed. If `v` is falsy, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
