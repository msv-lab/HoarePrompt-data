Output State: **`op` is 2, `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `median` is `b[ma] + 1, `b[ma]` is increased by 1.**

The code `b[ma] += 1` increases the value of `b[ma]` by 1. Since `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `b[ma]` is the element at the middle index of the sorted list `b`. The value of `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, so `median` will also be affected if `b[ma]` changes. However, since the problem specifies that `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, and `median` is defined as `b[ma] + 1`, the value of `new_median` will be less than or equal to `b[ma] + 1` after the operation.
