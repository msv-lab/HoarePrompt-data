Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers \((u, v)\), `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v, u]` and `nodes[v]` contains the value `[u]`, `u` is an integer obtained from the input, `v` is an integer obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `u` and `v` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the placeholders in the `edges` list and are stored as variables `u` and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
