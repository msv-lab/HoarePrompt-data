You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. Additionally, two binary strings of length n are provided, representing the values of a_{11}a_{12}...a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}...a_{2n}.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the original string representation of an integer, the second element is the second integer input as a string, and the third element is the third integer input as a string.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is 2 iterations based on the given information), `t` remains within the range of 1 to \(10^4\), `n` is the integer input by the user, and `a` is a list that contains three strings representing integers, with each string being the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. `s` will contain the concatenation of the first sublist of `a` up to the last index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, followed by the corresponding element from the second sublist of `a`. If no such index exists, `s` will be the concatenation of the entire first sublist and the last element of the second sublist. `x` will be the index `i` where the condition was last met, or `n - 1` if the condition was never met.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is 2, `x` is the same value as before (which is 2 since the loop did not find a new match beyond index 2), `a` remains a list of integers with the first element unchanged, `s` contains the concatenation of the first sublist of `a` up to index 2 and the corresponding elements from the second sublist, and `t` is 0.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: [1, 2, b[0], b[1]]
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two binary strings of length \(n\) and an integer \(t\). It then constructs a new string \(s\) by concatenating parts of the two binary strings based on specific conditions. Finally, it calculates a value \(t\) based on the matching segments of the original strings and prints both the constructed string \(s\) and the value \(t\). If no matching segment is found, \(t\) is set to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the lexicographically smallest string can be formed by taking the minimum value at each step, which might require considering both rows for each column.

Let's consider a counterexample:

For the input:
```
3
2
01
10
4
1101
1100
8
00100111
11101101
```

The expected output should be:
```
000
2
11000
1
001001101
4
```

However, the provided program does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest string. For instance, in the second test case, the expected lexicographically smallest string is `11000`, but the program outputs `11000` with a count of `1`. This is correct for this specific case, but the program fails to handle more complex cases properly.

To illustrate the failure, consider the following input:
```
3
2
01
11
4
1111
1111
8
00100111
11111101
```

The expected output should be:
```
000
2
1111
1
001001101
4
```

But the program will incorrectly output:
```
000
2
1111
1
001001101
1
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where the lexicographically smallest string can be formed by taking the minimum value at each step, especially when both rows have different values at the same position.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
