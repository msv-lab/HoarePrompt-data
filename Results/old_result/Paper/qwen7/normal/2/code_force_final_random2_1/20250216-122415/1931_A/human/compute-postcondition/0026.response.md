Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is either less than 27 or within the range [26, 78]; `arr` is a list containing the elements 26, 26**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the element 26. After appending another 26, `arr` now contains two elements, both of which are 26. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial states.
