Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), as indicated by `range(1, n)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the length of `pans` + 1.
   - `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - `n` is an input integer and greater than 0.
   - If the input string is `<`, no changes are made to `pans`, `mak`, or `n`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the length of `pans` + 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `1` and should still be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` to `length of pans + 2`.
   - `mak` will be updated to this new value of `i`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as long as it is greater than `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is the length of `pans` + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0**.
