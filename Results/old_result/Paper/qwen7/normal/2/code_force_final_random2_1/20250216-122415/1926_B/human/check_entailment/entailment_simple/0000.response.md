Reasoning:

1. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The program aims to determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions `n` and the grid itself.
   - It checks each row to see if it contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1'.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.
   - After processing all rows, it prints the value of `a` if set, otherwise it prints `b`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the condition where a row contains exactly one '1' (indicating a potential triangle).
   - The program correctly handles the condition where a row contains more than one '1' (indicating a square).
   - However, the logic has a flaw: it only checks if there is at least one row with exactly one '1' and one row with more than one '1'. This means it can miss cases where the entire grid forms a triangle or a square.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program fails to correctly identify the shape when the entire grid is a triangle or a square. It only checks individual rows and does not ensure that the entire grid forms a consistent shape.
   - For example, if the entire grid is a triangle or a square, the program might incorrectly identify it as a different shape because it only checks individual rows.

Given these points, the program is not correct because it does not ensure that the entire grid forms a consistent shape (either a triangle or a square).

Correctness: **False**
