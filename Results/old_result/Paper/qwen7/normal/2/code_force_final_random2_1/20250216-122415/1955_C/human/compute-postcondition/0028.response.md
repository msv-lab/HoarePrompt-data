Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 2, `sunks` is equal to 2, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `sunks` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
