The function processes multiple test cases, each involving integers n and m, and two lists of n integers a and b. It ensures that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000 and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function calls `func_1()` exactly `numero_testes` times, where `numero_testes` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The function does not return any value.
