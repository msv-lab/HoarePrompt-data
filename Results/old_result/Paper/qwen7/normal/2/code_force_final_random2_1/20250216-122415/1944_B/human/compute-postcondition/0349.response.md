Output State: **`k` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `len(l)` must be at least `n`, `ans2` is an empty list or initialized appropriately, `ans1` contains the element `l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `ans1` now contains the element `l[n]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
