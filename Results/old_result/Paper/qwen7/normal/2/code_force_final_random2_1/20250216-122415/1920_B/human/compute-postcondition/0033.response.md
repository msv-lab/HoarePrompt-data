Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: From the postcondition, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer. Since the loop starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop runs as long as `i < k + 1`. Therefore, if `i` is currently `j` (where `j` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), then for the loop to continue, `j + 1` should be less than `k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The value of `i` will be incremented by `1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The new value of `i` will be `j + 1`, where `j` is the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, let's assume the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration was `j`. For the loop to continue, `j + 1` must be less than `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `j + 1`.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `ans` and `sums` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can denote it as `j`. Thus, the new value of `i` will be `j + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1]`**.
