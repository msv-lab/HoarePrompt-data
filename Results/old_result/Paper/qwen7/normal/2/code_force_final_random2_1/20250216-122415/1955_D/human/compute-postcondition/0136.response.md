Output State: **`pairs_in_D` may decrease by 1, `D[out_aa]` is unchanged, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[in_aa]` may change as follows: if `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `C[in_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `C[in_aa]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
