Output State: **`a` is 'TRIANGLE' if at least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is 'SQUARE'; `s` holds the last input string processed by the loop; `i` is `n + 2`; `t` is the same as before; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n`, but does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, `i`, or `t`. The condition for `a` remains unchanged unless an input string containing exactly one '1' is provided during the loop processing, which is not specified in this snippet.
