Output State: **`i` is 1; `mak` is 1; `pans` is a list containing the element 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `pans` with the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `i` and `mak` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `mak` is still 1, and `pans` is a list containing the single element 1.
