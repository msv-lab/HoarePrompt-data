Output State: `op` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `median` is `b[ma] + 3, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `b[ma]` and update `op` until `new_median` becomes greater than `median`. Since the output state after 3 iterations shows that `new_median` is `b[ma] + 1` and `b` has been incremented by 1 each time, it implies that `b` was initially a list where each element was less than or equal to `median`. After 3 iterations, each element in `b` has been incremented by 3, making `new_median` also 3 units greater than `median`. Therefore, after all iterations, `op` will be 3 (since it increments by 1 each iteration), and every element in `b` will have been incremented by 3.
