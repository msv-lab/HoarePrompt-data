Output State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is either 16, 8, or 4, the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ans = []` simply initializes `ans` as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
