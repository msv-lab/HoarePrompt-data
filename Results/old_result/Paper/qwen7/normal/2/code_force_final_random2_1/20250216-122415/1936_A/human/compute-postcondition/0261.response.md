Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is 3.
   - `mak2` is `n-1`.
   - `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
   ```

3. **Determine Values:**
   - `mak` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `mak2` is `n-1`. Since `n` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak2`, but it is dependent on `n`.
   - `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`. So, `pans[mak]` would be `pans[3]`. Given `pans` is `[n-2, n-1]`, `pans[3]` does not exist because the list only has two elements. However, if we assume the list indexing starts from 0, then `pans[3]` would be out of bounds, but let's consider the valid indices.

Given the list `pans = [n-2, n-1]`, the valid index for `mak` (which is 3) is out of bounds. Therefore, the print statement will attempt to access an invalid index, which might result in an error or an undefined behavior depending on the Python version and environment. However, based on the given information, we should describe the intended values.

4. **Output Description:**
   - `mak2` is `n-1`.
   - `pans[mak]` would be `pans[3]`, but since `pans` only has two elements, this is out of bounds.

Output: **! (n-1) pans[3]** (where `n-1` is the value of `mak2` and `pans[3]` is out of bounds)
