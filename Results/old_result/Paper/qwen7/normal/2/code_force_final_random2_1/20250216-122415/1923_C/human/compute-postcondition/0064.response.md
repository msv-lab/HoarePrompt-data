Output State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element (one less than before), `c` is increased by the next element in `l`, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` appended.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(c)` appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. The values of `l` and `c` remain unchanged from their previous states, except that `c` is increased by the next element in `l` before the append operation. The list `p` now contains the updated value of `c`.
