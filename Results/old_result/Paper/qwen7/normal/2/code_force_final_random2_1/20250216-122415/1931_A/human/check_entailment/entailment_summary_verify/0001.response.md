### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the given program. Let's re-evaluate the program and the provided solution to ensure the correctness.

#### Issues in the Original Program

1. **Incorrect Decoding Logic:**
   - The original program uses incorrect conditions to decode the integer `lex` into the characters. For example, it incorrectly sets the second character to 'z' (26) when `lex < 52` and `lex <= 78`.
   - This leads to incorrect mappings and does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

2. **Unnecessary Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the array `arr` which is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct decoding process.

3. **Character Construction:**
   - The construction of the word using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` is correct but is applied to an incorrectly decoded array.

#### Corrected Program

The corrected program provided in the original assessment addresses these issues by:
1. Initializing the three characters with the smallest possible values (1, 1, 1).
2. Adjusting the characters to match the sum `n` while ensuring they remain within the valid range (1 to 26).
3. Constructing the word using the adjusted characters.

Let's break down the corrected program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   chars = [1, 1, 1]
   ```
   Start with the smallest possible values for the three characters.

2. **Adjusting Characters:**
   ```python
   for i in range(3):
       chars[i] += (lex - (chars[0] + chars[1] + chars[2])) // 26
       lex -= chars[i] * 26
   ```
   Increment each character by the quotient of `(lex - (chars[0] + chars[1] + chars[2])) // 26` and then subtract the corresponding value of `chars[i] * 26` from `lex`.

3. **Ensuring Valid Range:**
   ```python
   chars = [min(max(char, 1), 26) for char in chars]
   ```
   Ensure each character remains within the valid range (1 to 26).

4. **Constructing the Word:**
   ```python
   word = ''.join(chr(char + 96) for char in chars)
   ```
   Convert each character to its corresponding letter using `chr(char + 96)` and join them to form the word.

5. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(word)
   ```

This approach ensures that the lexicographically smallest word is constructed correctly for each test case.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the detailed analysis and the provided corrected program, the original program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed decoding logic. The corrected program provided in the original assessment is correct.

**Final: True**
