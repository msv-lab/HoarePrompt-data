Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < bets`.
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `bets`.
   - `ans` is the value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[bets]` followed by a space.

Given that `i` is equal to `bets` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop condition `i < bets` will be false, and the loop will terminate.

Since the loop is terminating, there are no further adjustments needed for `i` or `bets` within the loop head.

However, if we were to consider what would happen if the loop were to continue (which it won't), `i` would be incremented by 1, making it `bets + 1`.

But since the loop is not continuing, the only state that needs to be considered is the final state of `i` and `bets`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the termination of the loop) remains as follows:

**State: **`i` is `bets`, `ans` is the value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[bets]` followed by a space**
