Postcondition: `u` is the value of `u` decreased by 1, `c` is the return value of `r()`, and `d` is the second return value of `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the function does not change any additional variables. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, the function does not change any additional variables either.
