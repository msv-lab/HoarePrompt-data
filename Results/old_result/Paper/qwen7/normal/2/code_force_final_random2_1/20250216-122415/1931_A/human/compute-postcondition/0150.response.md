Output State: `j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is a list of length 2, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2. Depending on the value of `lex`, `arr` will contain either two 1s, two 26s, or one 1 and one 26. Specifically, if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` will be [1, 1]; if `lex` is between 28 and 53 (inclusive), `arr` will be [1, 26]; if `lex` is greater than 53, `arr` will be [26, 26]. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 1 or 2, and `lex` is adjusted according to the conditions within the loop, but its exact final value cannot be determined without knowing the initial value of `lex`.
