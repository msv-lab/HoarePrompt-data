Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs. For example, consider the input `24`. The correct answer should be `aav`, but the program incorrectly generates `aaa` because it does not properly distribute the remaining value after assigning the minimum possible values to the first two characters.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:
- For `n = 24`, the correct word is `aav` (1 + 1 + 22).
- However, the program assigns the minimum values to the first two characters (`1` and `1`) and then tries to assign the remaining value (`22`) to the third character. This results in `aaa` instead of `aav`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the smallest possible values are assigned to the first two characters and then correctly distribute the remaining value to the third character.
