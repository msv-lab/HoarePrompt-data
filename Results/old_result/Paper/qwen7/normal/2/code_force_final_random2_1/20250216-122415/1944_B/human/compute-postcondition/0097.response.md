Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be at least 3; `k` is -4; `ans2` now contains the element `c[3]` appended to it.**

The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[3]` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 3, the element `c[3]` is appended to `ans2`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
