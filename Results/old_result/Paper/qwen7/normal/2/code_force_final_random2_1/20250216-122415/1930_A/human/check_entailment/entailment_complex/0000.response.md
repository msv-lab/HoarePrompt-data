Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `numInteger` (which is `n`), which represents half the number of integers on the whiteboard.
3. It then reads the `2n` integers and stores them in a list called `numbers`.
4. The list `numbers` is sorted in ascending order.
5. A while loop processes the list in pairs, popping the first two elements, calculating their minimum, and adding it to the sum (`suma`).
6. This process continues until the list is empty.
7. The sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs is printed for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct. It correctly sorts the numbers and then iteratively picks the smallest pair of numbers to maximize the score, which aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
