Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(n):`. This means the loop variable is an underscore (`_`), which is a common practice when the loop variable is not used within the loop body. However, we still need to consider the other variables involved in the loop context.

2. **Understand the Context**: From the postcondition given, we know:
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `arr` is updated such that each element (except the last one) is replaced by the most significant digit of the next element in the original array.
   - `ans` is False.

3. **Determine the Loop Condition**: The loop runs `n` times. Since `i` starts at 0, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will increment by 1 at the start of each iteration. Therefore, if `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the number of iterations specified by the range function.
   - `arr` is updated based on its elements, but since the update process is not detailed in the loop itself, we assume it remains updated as per the rule given.
   - `ans` remains False unless explicitly changed within the loop body, which is not mentioned here.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged values of `m`, `arr`, and `ans`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is updated such that each element (except the last one) is replaced by the most significant digit of the next element in the original array, and `ans` is False**.
