The code snippet provided does not involve any variables or expressions that change their values within the scope of the print statement. It directly prints a string literal.

Given the initial state and postcondition, we know that `c` is 0, `casos` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `n` is equal to 4. However, these variables do not affect the print statement itself.

The print statement simply outputs the string `..##..##`.

Output: **..##..##**
