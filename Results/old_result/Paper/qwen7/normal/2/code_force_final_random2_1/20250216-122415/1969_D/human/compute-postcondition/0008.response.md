Output State: **`max_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, t is the length of test_cases, heap is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, bonuses is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The line `max_profit = 0` initializes the variable `max_profit` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `max_profit` is now set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial states.
