Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range 1 to \(n\), `l` is now `r-3`, `r` is now `n-3`, `sunks` is increased by 1 to `sunks + 1`, `k` is decreased by `2 * a[l]` and further by `2 * a[r]` if `a[r]` is not zero, `a[r]` is reduced by `a[l]` and further by `a[l]` if `a[r]` is not zero.
