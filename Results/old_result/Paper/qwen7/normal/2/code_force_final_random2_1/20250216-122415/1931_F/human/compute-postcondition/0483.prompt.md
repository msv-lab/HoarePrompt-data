Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `m` must be exactly 3, `a3` is the first integer from each of the three inputs, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input, `val` is a list containing three tuples: each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (3 times in this case), `m` will be exactly 3 because the loop runs `m-2` times. Each iteration of the loop appends a tuple consisting of `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. Since the loop runs 3 times, `val` will contain 3 such tuples.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` is 3, `val` is a list containing exactly 3 tuples, each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`). If `l3` is not equal to a list created by iterating through `l` and including only elements that are not equal to `a3`, then the condition remains as is. Otherwise, the condition also remains as is since there is no else part that changes the state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` is 3, `val` is a list containing exactly 2 tuples, each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`). If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` is 3, `val` is a list containing exactly 1 tuple, each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`). If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
