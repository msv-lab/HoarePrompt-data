Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The value of `m` remains unchanged as it was initially set to an input integer. The new list `arr` contains the integers from the input string.
