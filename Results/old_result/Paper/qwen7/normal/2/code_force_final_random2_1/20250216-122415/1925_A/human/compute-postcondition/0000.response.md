Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 676, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 676.
