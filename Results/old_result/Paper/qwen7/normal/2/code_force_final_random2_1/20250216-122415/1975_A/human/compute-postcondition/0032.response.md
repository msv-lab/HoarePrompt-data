Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is True if all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`, and in both cases (whether the if condition is met or not), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
