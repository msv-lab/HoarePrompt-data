Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing the elements 2, `mak` is 2**

Explanation: The code `pans = [i]` updates the list `pans` to contain only the element `i`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `n` is still greater than 0, `s` remains the input string, and `pans` now contains the single element 2.
