Output State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `num` is the first element of `a`, `required_mod_x` is ((x - mod_x) % x)**.

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` which is the result of `(x - mod_x) % x`. This calculation does not affect the values of `a`, `num`, or `mod_y`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `required_mod_x` is assigned the calculated value.
