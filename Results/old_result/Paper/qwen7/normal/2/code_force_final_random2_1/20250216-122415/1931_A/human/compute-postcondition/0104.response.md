The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `lex` is between -25 and 26 (inclusive), and `arr` is a list containing the elements 1, 26, 26, 26, 26; `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26]. The loop condition is `i < cases`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `cases`. Since `j` is 1, it does not directly affect the loop condition. We need to determine the value of `cases` based on the information given.

Given the initial state and the fact that `j` is 1, we can infer that `cases` should be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. However, since we are considering the state after the previous iteration, `i` would be 1 (as `j` is incremented by 1 each iteration).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1 and `cases` must be greater than 1. Given the information, the smallest possible value for `cases` that allows the loop to execute one more time is 2.

State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is between -25 and 26 (inclusive), `arr` is a list containing the elements 1, 26, 26, 26, 26; `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], `i` is 1, `cases` must be greater than 1**
