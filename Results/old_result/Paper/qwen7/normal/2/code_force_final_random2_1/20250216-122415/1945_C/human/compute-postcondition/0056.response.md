Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`; `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`; `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`; `_` is still 0; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `s` is the input string; `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`; `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`; `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `mini` will hold the smallest difference between `pk` and any index `ele` in the list `lst`. The counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s` (stored in `zero` and `one`) will reflect the total occurrences of these characters in the entire string. The other variables (`_`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, and `lst`) will retain their values from the final state of the last iteration, with `lst` containing all indices where the percentage of '0's and '1's is at least 50%.
