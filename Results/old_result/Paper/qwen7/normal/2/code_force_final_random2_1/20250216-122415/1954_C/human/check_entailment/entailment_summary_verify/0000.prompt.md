You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    73
    
    31
    
    2
    
    5
    
    3516
    
    3982

Output

    71
    33
    5
    2
    3912
    3586

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, each representing an integer of the same length. It then compares the corresponding digits of these strings. If a digit in `x` is smaller than the corresponding digit in `y`, it swaps them. This process continues until either no more swaps are needed or the end of the strings is reached. After the comparisons, it prints the modified string `x` followed by the original string `y`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the lengths of `a` and `b` are different. According to the problem description, both `x` and `y` are of the same length, but the program does not check this condition. Additionally, the logic inside `func_1()` is flawed because it only swaps digits if `f` is 0 initially, which means it might not always perform the necessary swaps to maximize the product.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
123
456
```
The program will output:
```
456
123
```
However, the optimal solution would be to swap the digits such that the resulting numbers are `654` and `321`, which would yield a higher product. The current implementation does not guarantee this behavior.
