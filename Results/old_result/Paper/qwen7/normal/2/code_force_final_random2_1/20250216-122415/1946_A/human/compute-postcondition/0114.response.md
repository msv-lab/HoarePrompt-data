Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, an integer `num2`, and a space-separated string of integers `case`. If `num2` exceeds 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 then breaks. Otherwise, it calculates the median of the sorted list of integers from `case`, increments the median until it surpasses the original median, and counts the number of increments. It then prints the count of increments. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
