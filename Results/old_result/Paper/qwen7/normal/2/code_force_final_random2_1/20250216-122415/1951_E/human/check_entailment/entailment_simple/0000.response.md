Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if a string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It correctly returns `True` if the first half of the string is equal to the reverse of the second half, and `False` otherwise.
   
2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function determines how many partitions are needed for a string `ch` to ensure none of the substrings are palindromic.
   - It uses `func_1` to check the middle part of the string and decides the number of partitions accordingly.
   - The logic seems to be flawed because it doesn't actually perform the partitioning, just determines the number of partitions needed. However, the main issue is that it doesn't handle all edge cases properly.

3. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It uses `func_1` and `func_2` to make decisions about how to partition the string.
   - There are several issues:
     - The logic for determining the number of partitions (`a`) in `func_2` is not implemented correctly.
     - The actual partitioning logic is missing.
     - The main loop does not correctly handle the partitioning process and instead relies on `T1` and `T2`, which are not properly defined or used.
     - The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when the string itself is a palindrome or when the string length is very small.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **False**
