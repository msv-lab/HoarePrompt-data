Output State: **`a` is a non-empty array with at least one element (excluding the first element), `mod_y` is the remainder of the new `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is increased by 1.**

This means that after executing the line `mod_x = num % x`, the following updates occur:
- The array `a` loses its first element, making it a non-empty array with at least one less element.
- `mod_x` is calculated as the remainder of the current `num` when divided by `x`.
- `required_mod_y` remains unchanged and is equal to the new `mod_y`.
- The frequency of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` is incremented by 1.
