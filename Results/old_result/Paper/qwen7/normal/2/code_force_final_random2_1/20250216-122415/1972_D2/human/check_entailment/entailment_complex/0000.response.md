Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**: The function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy the given conditions. It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) within the specified constraints and checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(x\) and \(y\) is 1. If true, it calculates the minimum value of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \times x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \times y}\) and adds it to the counter `cnt`.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**: The function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. This ensures that the logic implemented in `func_1()` is applied to each test case independently.

3. **Overall Program Logic**: The overall program structure is correct. It first reads the number of test cases, then processes each test case by calling `func_1()`, and finally prints the result for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**: The constraints and edge cases are handled appropriately. The program correctly processes the input within the given limits and ensures that the sum of \(n\) and \(m\) values across all test cases does not exceed the specified limit.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution for the problem statement provided.

Correctness: **True**
