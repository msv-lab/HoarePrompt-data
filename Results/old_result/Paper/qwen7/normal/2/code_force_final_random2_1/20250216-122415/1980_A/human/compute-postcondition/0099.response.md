Output State: **`i` is one of the remaining keys in `hmp`, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is `12 - hmp[i]`, `hmp` is {'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 1} with one fewer key, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. Initially, `ans` is `6 + (m - hmp[i])`. After executing the line `ans += m - hmp[i]`, `ans` becomes `6 + (m - hmp[i]) + (m - hmp[i])`, which simplifies to `12 - hmp[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
