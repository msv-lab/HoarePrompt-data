Output State: **`t` is 1, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer equal to the second element of `info`, and no pairs (i, j) satisfying the condition `(j+i) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0` have been printed.**

Explanation: The given code contains nested loops iterating over `i` from 1 to `a` and `j` from 4 to `b`. For each pair `(i, j)`, it checks if `(j + i) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0`. However, since the code only contains a print statement inside the if condition and does not assign any values to any variables outside these loops, none of the variables `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, or `b` are modified. The print statement itself does not modify any variables but would print pairs `(i, j)` that satisfy the condition. Since no such pairs are found, no output is generated, and the original values of the variables remain unchanged.
