Output State: **`mak` is 1, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variable values or change any state. It simply flushes the output buffer. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
