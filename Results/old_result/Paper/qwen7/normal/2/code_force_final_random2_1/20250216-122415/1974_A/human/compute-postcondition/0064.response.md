Postcondition: **`t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is equal to `b`, if `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2, otherwise, `t` is updated to `(b // 2) + 1`, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split, `t2` is `a - t1`, and depending on whether `t2 % 15 == 0` is true or false, `t` is either `t + t2 // 15` or `t + (t2 // 15 + 1)`.**
