Output State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to `sums`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `k`, `ans`, and `sums`) are updated as follows:

- `i` remains `j + 1`.
- `k` remains a non-negative integer.
- `ans` remains a list.
- `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]`.

All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
