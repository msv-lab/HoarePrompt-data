Output State: **`ai` is 0, `i` is 3, `op` is `op ^ (val >> 3 & 1)`, `t` is a list containing one element which is `ai ^ (val ^ val)`**

Explanation: The line `ai = 0` sets the value of `ai` to 0. The values of `i`, `op`, and the list `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `t` is a list containing one element, which is `ai ^ (val ^ val)`. Since `ai` is now 0, the element in the list `t` becomes `0 ^ (val ^ val)`, which simplifies to `val ^ val`, and since any number XORed with itself is 0, the element in `t` is `0`. However, the format of the output state keeps the original expression for clarity.
