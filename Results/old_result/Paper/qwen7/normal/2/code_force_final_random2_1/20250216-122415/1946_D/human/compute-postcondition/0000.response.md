Output State: **`n` is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ n[0] ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ n[1] < 2^30; `x` is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ x[0] ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x[1] < 2^30.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, x = func_3()` assigns the return values of the function `func_3()` to the variables `n` and `x`. Since the function `func_3()` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `x`. However, based on the precondition, we know that `n` and `x` are both tuples of two integers where the first element of `n` is between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive, and the second element of `n` is between 0 and \(2^{30} - 1\) inclusive. Similarly, the first element of `x` is between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive, and the second element of `x` is between 0 and \(2^{30} - 1\) inclusive. Therefore, the output state reflects these constraints.
