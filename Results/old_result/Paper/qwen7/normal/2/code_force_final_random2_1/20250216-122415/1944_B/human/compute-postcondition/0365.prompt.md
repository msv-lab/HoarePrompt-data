Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `k` is equal to `req` - 2 * (n - 2), `i` is equal to n, `n` is defined and greater than 1, `ans2` contains the values of `c[1]` through `c[n-1]` if `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]` for each iteration, and `k` becomes 0 if it reaches 0 before the loop completes all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `k` will have been decremented by 2 for each iteration, resulting in `k = req - 2 * (n - 2)`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`. The list `ans2` will contain pairs of consecutive elements from the list `c` where the elements are equal, up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop ends.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is equal to -1, `i` is equal to `n`, `len(l)` must be at least `n`, `ans2` contains the element `l[i]`, `ans1` contains the element `l[i]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is -2, `i` is `n + 1`, `len(l)` must be at least `n`, `ans2` now contains the elements `l[n + 1]` and the element appended from `l[i]`, `ans1` appends the element `l[n + 1]` to itself, and the loop breaks out of the iteration if `k` equals 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is -1, `i` is `n + 2`, `len(l)` must be at least `n + 2`, `ans2` contains the elements `l[n + 1]` and `l[i]`, `ans1` appends the element `l[n + 1]` to itself and contains the elements `l[n + 1]` and `l[i]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
