Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. It correctly reads pairs of integers `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Logic Implementation**: For each pair of integers `a` and `b`, the program checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd. According to the problem statement, if the absolute difference is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

3. **Output**: The program prints "Bob" if the absolute difference is even and "Alice" if it is odd. This matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all valid inputs within the specified ranges (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).

Given that the program correctly implements the logic and handles all valid inputs as per the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
