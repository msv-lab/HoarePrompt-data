Output State: `i` is 20, `idx` is 19, `n` is an input integer (unchanged), `k` is an input integer (unchanged), `nums` is a list containing elements `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the length of the `nums` list. Since `nums` has 21 elements, the loop will execute 21 times. According to the given pattern, after each iteration, `i` increases by 1 and `idx` is set to `i - 1`. Therefore, after the last iteration (20th iteration), `i` will be 20 and `idx` will be 19. All other variables (`n`, `k`, and `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
