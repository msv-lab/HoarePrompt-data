Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the deque `tree` now contains either `u` followed by `v` or `v` as its first element, depending on whether `u` equals `tree[0]`. If `u` equals `tree[0]`, `u` is added to the left end of `tree`, otherwise `u` is appended to the right end of `tree`.
