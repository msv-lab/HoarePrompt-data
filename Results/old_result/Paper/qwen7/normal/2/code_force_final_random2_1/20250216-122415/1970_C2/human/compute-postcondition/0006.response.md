Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers `(u, v)`, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v]` and all other values are still empty lists.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value `v` to the list associated with the key `u` in the `nodes` defaultdict. Since `u` and `v` are part of the `edges` list, and the initial state specifies that `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially empty lists, after executing the code, `nodes[u]` will contain `[v]`. All other values in `nodes` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
