Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers input by the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `sums` is updated as follows:
- If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`.
- If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`.
`ans` contains the value of `sums` after the update.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i == 0`, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`. The variable `ans` contains the final value of `sums` after the update.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated based on the same conditions, and `ans` contains the final value of `sums` after the update. If `i` equals 0, `ans` is appended with the value of `sums`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[2]` and subtracting `2 * a[x]`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[2]`, `ans` now contains `[sums]`, and `k` is greater than 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
