Output State: **`i` is `mak + 2`, `mak` is `mak + 1`, `len(pans)` must be greater than `mak + 2`**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variable values. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation related to I/O handling rather than variable assignment or modification. Therefore, the values of the variables `i`, `mak`, and the condition on `len(pans)` remain unchanged.
