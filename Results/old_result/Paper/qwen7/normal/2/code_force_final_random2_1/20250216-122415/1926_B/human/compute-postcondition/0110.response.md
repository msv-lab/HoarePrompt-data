Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is either 'SQUARE' (if any of the input strings contain more than one '1') or remains unchanged (if all input strings contain exactly one '1'), and `s` is updated to the new input string after the last iteration.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `n - 1` since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `b` will be 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings had more than one '1' at any point during the loop's execution. Otherwise, if all input strings had exactly one '1', `b` will remain an empty string (`''`). The variable `s` will hold the last input string processed by the loop.
