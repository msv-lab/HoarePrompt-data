Output State: **`lst` must have at least one element remaining, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Since the exact values of `mini`, `pk`, and `ele` are not specified, we can only say that `mini` has been updated accordingly. The list `lst` remains unchanged, and it is mentioned that it must have at least one element remaining.
