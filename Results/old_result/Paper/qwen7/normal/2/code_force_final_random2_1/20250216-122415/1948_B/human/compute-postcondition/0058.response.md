Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`, `ans` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no specific loop or if statement is mentioned in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial states.
