Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ans` is 3, `s` is the substring 'ma'.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will have the value 3 because the loop increments `ans` each time it finds and removes the substring 'map'. The final state of `s` will be 'ma' because the loop continues to remove 'map' until it can no longer find it, which leaves only 'ma' in the string.
Code of the loop:
while s.find('pie') != -1:
    s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
    ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is 4, `s` does not contain the substring 'pie' at least once
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `ans` is 5; `s` contains the substring 'pi'
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `ans` is 6; `s` contains the substring from the start to the index right before 'pie' plus the substring from the index right after 'pie' to the end.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
