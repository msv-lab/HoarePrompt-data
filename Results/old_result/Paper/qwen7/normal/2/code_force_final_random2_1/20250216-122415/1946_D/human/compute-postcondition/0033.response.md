Output State: **`a` is the same list, `val` is the next element in `a`, `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> 1 & 1`, `ai` is 1, `t` is [0, 0]**.

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR (`^`) operation with the result of `val >> 1 & 1`. Here, `val >> 1` shifts the bits of `val` one position to the right, and `& 1` ensures that only the least significant bit is considered. However, since `val` is the next element in the list `a` and `i` is 1, the expression `val >> 1 & 1` evaluates to the least significant bit of `val`. This value is then XORed with `op`. The other variables remain unchanged.
