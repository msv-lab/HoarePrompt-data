Postcondition: `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `num` is the first element of `a`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and if the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is present in the set `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`.
