Output State: `h` is the sum of all elements in the original `costs` list, `n` is reduced to the remainder when divided by the largest element in `costs` after processing all elements, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `h` will be the sum of all values originally in the `costs` list. The variable `n` will be reduced to its remainder when divided by the largest value in the `costs` list, after subtracting multiples of each value in `costs` from `n`. The variable `k` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The `costs` list will be reduced to a single element, which is `1`, since each iteration reduces it by one element until none are left.
