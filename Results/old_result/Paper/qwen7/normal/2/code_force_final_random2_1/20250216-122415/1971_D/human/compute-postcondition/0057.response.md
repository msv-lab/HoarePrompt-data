Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 2, and the current value of `s[j]` is '1' and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1'**.

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given that the initial value of `j` was 1, after executing this line, `j` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
