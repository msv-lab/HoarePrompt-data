Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is (a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1 which simplifies to 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `a // 1 + 1`, resulting in `a + 1`. Since `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, and `i` is 1, `x` is calculated as `a + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
