Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with a length of at least 2, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 1, the current value of `s[j]` is '1', the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1'**.

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` was 0. After the increment, `j` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `s[j]` changes from '0' to '1' because `j` now points to the second character in the string `s`.
