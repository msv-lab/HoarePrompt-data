Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the element at index `a` which now contains `[b, a]`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 2, `n` is the same as before, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are specific to the input provided by the user.
