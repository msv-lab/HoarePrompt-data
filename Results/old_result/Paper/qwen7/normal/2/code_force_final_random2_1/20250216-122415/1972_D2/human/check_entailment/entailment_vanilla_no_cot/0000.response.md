Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for Pair Validation**:
   - The condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b` is not properly handled in the nested loops.
   - Specifically, the inner loop increments `y` without checking the condition `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates `cnt` by iterating through possible values of `x` and `y`, but it does not correctly validate the condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b`.
   - It assumes `y` starts from 1 and checks if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, which does not guarantee that the condition is met.

3. **Missing Validation Logic**:
   - There is no logic to check if `b * gcd(a, b)` is indeed a multiple of `a + b` before incrementing the count.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the condition `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

This corrected approach iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and checks the condition directly. This ensures that only pairs satisfying the condition are counted.
