Output State: **`a` is an empty array, `beautiful_count` contains the total count of numbers that meet the specified conditions across all iterations, `freq` holds the count of numbers that have specific `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs as their remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from `case['params']`, and `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` must contain at least one more element.**

In this step, the code assigns the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the dictionary `case['params']`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
