Output State: **`k` is `-2 * (len(l) - 1)`, `ans1` is a list that includes all elements from `l`, `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `input().split(' ')`. These values are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `ans1`, `ans2`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
