Output State: **`t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is equal to `b`, if `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2, otherwise, `t` is updated to `(b // 2) + 1`, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split, `n` must be greater than 1, `t` remains unchanged.**

The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. Therefore, the value of `t` remains the same as it was before, which is determined by the condition: if `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2, otherwise, `t` is updated to `(b // 2) + 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
