Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining space-separated inputs, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0**.

The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, or `p`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
