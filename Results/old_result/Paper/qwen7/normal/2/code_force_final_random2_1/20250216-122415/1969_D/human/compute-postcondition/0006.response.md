Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, t is the length of test_cases, heap is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`**.

Explanation: The code creates a new list `neg_prices` which contains the negative values of each element in the `prices` list. The original values and relationships of the other variables remain unchanged.
