Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings sorted in ascending order without the first element, `a` is the first element of the original list converted to an integer, `b` is the last element processed (if any), `suma` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `a`. The precondition that `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings sorted in ascending order remains valid, but now it does not include the first element. All other variables remain unchanged.
