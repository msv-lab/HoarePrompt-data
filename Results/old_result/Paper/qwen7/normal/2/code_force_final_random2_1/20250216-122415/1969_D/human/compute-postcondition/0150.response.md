Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is reassigned to `current_profit`, `combined` must contain at least one item less than before, `removed_item` is now equal to the last element popped from `combined`, `current_profit` is adjusted by either subtracting `removed_item[0]` or by subtracting `item[1]` or increasing it by `item[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `item = combined.pop()` pops the last element from the `combined` list and assigns it to the variable `item`. This means `combined` now has at least one item less than before. The value of `removed_item` is updated to be the last element that was popped from `combined`. The other variables (`k`, `heap`, `max_profit`, and `current_profit`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously mentioned states.
