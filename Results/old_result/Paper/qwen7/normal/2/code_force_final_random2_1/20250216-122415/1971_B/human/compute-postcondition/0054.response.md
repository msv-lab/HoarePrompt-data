Functionality: **The function processes an integer `t` and a string `s`. It iterates `t` times, each time reading a new string `s`. For each string, it checks if the string length is 1 or if all characters are the same; if so, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it generates a random permutation of the string or a left rotation of the string and prints 'Yes' followed by the modified string. After processing all strings, the function ensures that `t` is reduced to 0 and prints the final string `s` after all iterations.**
