Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers `(u, v)`, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially empty lists.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `u` and `v` from input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values are then assigned to the variables `u` and `v`. Since `u` and `v` are read from input, their specific values are not known, but they are guaranteed to be integers. The `edges` list is updated to contain the pair `(u, v)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
