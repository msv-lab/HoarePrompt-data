Postcondition: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`. If `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp` is set to 2. Otherwise, `temp` remains 1. The most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
