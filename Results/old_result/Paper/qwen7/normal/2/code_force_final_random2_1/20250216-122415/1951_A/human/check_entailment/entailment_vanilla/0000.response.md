Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description:
The task involves generating two files (`ac.py` and `wa.py`) for each `.html` file found within directories named with digits between `start` and `end`. The directories are expected to be subdirectories of the current working directory.

### Provided Code Analysis:

#### Function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`:
1. **Current Directory**: The function starts by getting the current working directory.
2. **Subfolders**: It lists all subdirectories in the current directory.
3. **Filtering Subfolders**: It filters these subdirectories to include only those whose names are digits and fall within the specified range `[start, end]`.
4. **HTML Files**: For each qualifying subdirectory, it lists all `.html` files.
5. **File Generation**: For each `.html` file, it generates two new files: `ac.py` and `wa.py`, both empty.

#### Main Execution Block:
- The main block calls `generate_files_for_html_in_range(1951, 1980)`.

### Provided Additional Code:
The additional code defines a function `func_1()` which is not used anywhere in the provided `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function. This is irrelevant to the problem at hand.

### Correctness Determination:
- The provided `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
- The function does not rely on any input from `func_1()`, which is unused.
- The logic for generating the files is straightforward and follows the requirements accurately.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement without any logical errors or dependencies on unused functions, the code is correct.

**Correctness: True**
