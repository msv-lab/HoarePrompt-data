Output State: `L` is equal to `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is `(L + R) // 2`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be true because `R` and `L` will converge to the same value. At this point, the loop terminates. Given that `numCuts` remains 0 after all iterations, and considering the logic inside the loop, `L` will eventually equal `R`. The value of `x` will be the last computed midpoint of `L` and `R`, which is `(L + R) // 2`. The values of `z`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `numCuts`, and `dfs(1, 1)`'s result (`leftover`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
