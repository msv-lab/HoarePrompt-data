Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to \(10^4\), and `n` is not equal to 2.
   - `max_index` is 0, but this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. For the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to 0 (the starting value of the range function) and `n` must be a valid integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is 0 and `n` is within the valid range.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to \(10^4\) and `n` is not equal to 2**
