Output State: **`zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))**.

This means that the percentage of zeros (`zero`) in the substring `s[0:i+1]` is calculated using the formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. The values of `n` and `zero_perc` are new variables introduced by this calculation, while the conditions for `zero` and `one` remain as specified.
