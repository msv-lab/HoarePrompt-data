Postcondition: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001), `L` is set to 50001. Otherwise, `L` is set to 1.**
