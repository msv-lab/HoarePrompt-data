Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from `a[1:]`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`, `n` must still be at least 2.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `new` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `new` is a list containing elements from `a[1:]`**
