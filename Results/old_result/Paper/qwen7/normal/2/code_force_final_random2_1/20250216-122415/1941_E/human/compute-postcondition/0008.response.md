Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - `rows` remains a list of `n` lists.
   - `costs` remains a list of `n` elements.
   - `i` is `len(costs) - k`.
   - `total_costs` has one additional element which is the sum of the last `k` elements of the `costs` list.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `len(costs) - k`, the loop will increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `len(costs) - k + 1`.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
   - After the increment, `i` becomes `len(costs) - k + 1`.
   - The loop condition checks if `len(costs) - k + 1 < len(costs) - (k - 1)`, which simplifies to `1 < 1`, which is false.
   - Hence, the loop will not execute again because `i` is no longer less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `total_costs` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted.
   - `rows` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted.
   - `costs` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(costs) - k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, `costs` remains a list of `n` elements, `i` is `len(costs) - k + 1`.**
