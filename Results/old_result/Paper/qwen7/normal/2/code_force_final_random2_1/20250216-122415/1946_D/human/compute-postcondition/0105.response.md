Output State: **`a` is a list with all its elements processed, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation on `val >> i & 1` for each `val` in `t`, `ai` is 0, `val` is no longer used, `t` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `a, t = t, []` swaps the values of `a` and `t`. After the swap, `a` becomes the original `t`, and `t` becomes an empty list `[]`. All other variables (`op`, `ai`, and `val`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
