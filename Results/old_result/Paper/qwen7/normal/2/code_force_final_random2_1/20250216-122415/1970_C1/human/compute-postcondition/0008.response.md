Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` is appended to the deque `tree`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the deque `tree` now contains the elements `u`, `v`, `empty` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `empty` is assigned the boolean value `False`, which means the deque `tree` is not empty. All other variables retain their initial states.
