Output State: `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros, `x` is 0, `ans` is 10000.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `cnt` list, which initially has 10001 elements all set to zero. For each iteration, the value of `x` is taken from `cnt`, and `ans` is incremented by `max(0, x - 1)`. Since `x` is always 0 (as it is taken from a list of zeros), `max(0, x - 1)` will always be 0 except for the last iteration when `x` becomes the last element of the list, which is still 0 but the loop will increment `ans` one last time. Therefore, `ans` will be incremented 10000 times, starting from 0, resulting in `ans` being 10000. The `cnt` list remains unchanged as no operation modifies its elements inside the loop, and `a` is not affected by the loop.
