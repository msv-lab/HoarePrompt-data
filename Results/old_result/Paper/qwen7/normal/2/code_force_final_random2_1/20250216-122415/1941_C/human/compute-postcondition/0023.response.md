Output State: **`ans` is 6; `s` contains the substring from the start to the index right before 'pie' plus the substring from the index right after 'pie' to the end.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` was initially 5, and it is incremented by 1, making it 6. The variable `s` remains unchanged as the code snippet only modifies `ans`.
