Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of triples (n, x, y, a) where n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, x and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `case` is now the second element in `test_cases`, `a` is the array from the second element in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the array from the second element in `test_cases` to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `case` remain unchanged from their initial states.
