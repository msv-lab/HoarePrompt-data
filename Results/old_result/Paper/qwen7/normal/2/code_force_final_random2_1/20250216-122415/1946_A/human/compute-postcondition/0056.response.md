Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `new_median <= median`.

2. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The relevant variables are `new_median` and `median`.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `op` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `b` is the sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3 (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2 (this is used to determine `new_median`).
   - `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3` (this is part of the loop condition).
   - `median` is `b[ma]` (this is part of the loop condition).

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.
   - Given that `new_median = b[ma] + 3` and `median = b[ma]`, the condition `new_median <= median` simplifies to `b[ma] + 3 <= b[ma]`, which is never true unless there is some external adjustment.

Since the condition `new_median <= median` cannot naturally be satisfied with the given states (as `new_median` is always 3 more than `median`), we need to adjust the state such that this condition can be met for the first iteration of the loop.

**Adjustment**:
- We need to ensure that `b[ma]` is adjusted in such a way that `b[ma] + 3 <= b[ma]` becomes true. This is impossible with the current setup, so we need to consider an external factor or a different initial state that allows this condition to be met.

Given the constraints, the only feasible adjustment would be to change the initial state of `b[ma]` to a value that makes the condition `new_median <= median` true.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`, `median` is `b[ma]` and `b[ma]` must be greater than or equal to 3**.

This ensures that `new_median` can potentially be less than or equal to `median` for the first iteration of the loop.
