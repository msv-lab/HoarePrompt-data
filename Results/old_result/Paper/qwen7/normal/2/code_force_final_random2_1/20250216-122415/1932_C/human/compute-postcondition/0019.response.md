Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `b` is a list
   - If `s[i]` equals 'L', then `b` is a list with one element from `a[l]` appended and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `b` is a list with one element `a[r-1]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `n`, we need to check if `i < n` to determine if the loop can continue.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 0, the condition `i < n` is true if `n > 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop continuation, not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the Postconditions**:
   - The postcondition for `b` will depend on the value of `s[i]` (which is now `s[2]`).
   - If `s[2]` equals 'L', then `b` will be a list with one element from `a[l]` appended and `l` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `b` will be a list with one element `a[r-1]`.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, and `b` is a list. If `s[2]` equals 'L', then `b` is a list with one element from `a[l]` appended and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `b` is a list with one element `a[r-1]`**.
