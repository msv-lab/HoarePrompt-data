Output State: **`func_1()` has been called again.**

Explanation: The code `func_1()` is called, which means `func_1()` has been called at least twice. The precondition that `numero_testes` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, but since no specific value was provided for `numero_testes`, we cannot specify its exact value. The only change is that `func_1()` has been called once more.
