Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides this product by each multiplier to get the bet amounts. This approach does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.
   - For example, consider the case where `a = [3, 2, 7]`. The product is `42`, and dividing by each element gives `[14, 21, 6]`. The total bet is `41`, but the winnings for the third outcome is `42`, which is not strictly greater than `41`.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation:**
   - The program sums up the calculated bet amounts (`sumo`) and checks if it is greater than or equal to the product (`prod`). However, this check should be for each individual outcome's winnings being strictly greater than the total bet.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the bet amounts in a string format with spaces, which is acceptable but not necessary. The main issue lies in the logic used to calculate the bets.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome. One possible approach is to use binary search or a greedy algorithm to find the minimum bet amounts that satisfy the condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Calculate the minimum bet for each outcome
        min_bets = []
        for k in a:
            min_bet = 1
            while True:
                total_bet = sum(min_bet * (k // i) for i in a)
                if total_bet < k * min_bet:
                    break
                min_bet += 1
            min_bets.append(min_bet)
        
        # Check if a solution exists
        if all(k * min_bets[i] > sum(min_bets[j] * (a[j] // a[i]) for j in range(bets)) for i in range(bets)):
            print(' '.join(str(b) for b in min_bets))
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome by using a greedy approach to find the minimum bet amounts.
