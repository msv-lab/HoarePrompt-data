Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` which contains all elements from `l2` except for `a1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
