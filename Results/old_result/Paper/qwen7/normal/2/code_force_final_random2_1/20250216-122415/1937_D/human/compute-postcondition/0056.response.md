Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `zeroInd` using the function `func_1` applied to the list `suffZero` and the values `ol + 1` and `1`. However, since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `zeroInd`. But we know that `zeroInd` is calculated based on the given formula involving `func_1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
