Output State: **`op` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted, `i` is `num`, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string.**

Explanation: The code `case = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `case`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `op`, `a`, `b`, `ma`, `new_median`, `median`, `b`, `i`, and `num2` remain unchanged. The only new information introduced is that `case` now holds the input string provided by the user.
