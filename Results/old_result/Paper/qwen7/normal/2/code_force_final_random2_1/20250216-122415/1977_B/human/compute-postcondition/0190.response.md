Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 30
   - `length` is greater than 29

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, length)`.
   - This means the loop will continue as long as `i < length`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 30.

4. **Condition for Loop Continuation:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `length`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since `i` is currently 30, for the loop to continue, `length` must be greater than 30.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged because the condition `s[29]` is '-1' and `s[28]` is '1' does not change `i`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `length` to ensure it is greater than 30.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 30, `length` must be greater than 30**
