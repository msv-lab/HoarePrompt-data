Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in cnt:`. The variables involved here are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the list `cnt`. Since `x` is iterating over each element in `cnt`, the value of `x` will change with each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers (not relevant for the loop).
   - `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `ans` is 1.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `x` is currently 0 and it is iterating over `cnt`, the next value of `x` will be the first element in `cnt`.
   - `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros, so the first element is 0.
   - Therefore, after the next iteration, `x` will be 0 (the first element) and `cnt` will now be a list of 10000 zeros (since the first element has been "consumed" by the loop).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `x` will be the first element of `cnt`, which is 0.
   - `cnt` will now be a list of 10000 zeros.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of 10000 zeros, `x` is 0, `ans` is 1**
