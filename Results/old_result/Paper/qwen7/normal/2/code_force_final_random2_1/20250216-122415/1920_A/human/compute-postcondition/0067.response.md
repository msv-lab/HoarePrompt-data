Output State: **`no` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `num` is the final value it reached after all possible decrements, `big` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `big = []` creates a new empty list and assigns it to the variable `big`. This does not affect the values of `no`, `less`, or `num`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value for `big` and retains the initial states of `no`, `less`, and `num`.
