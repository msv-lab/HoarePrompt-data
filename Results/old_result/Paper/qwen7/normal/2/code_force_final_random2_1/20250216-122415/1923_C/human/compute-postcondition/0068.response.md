Output State: **`l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`, and `p` is a list containing all intermediate sums of `c` as the loop iterates through each element of `l`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `c` will hold the total sum of all elements in the list `l`. The list `p` will contain each cumulative sum at every step of the iteration, starting from the first element up to the last one in `l`.
