Postcondition: **`p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `idx1` is either 0 or 1, `idx2` is either 0 or 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is true, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged.**
