Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `num` is 0, `m` is either 0 or `n - num`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are newly assigned values from the input, and `c` and `r` are the last integers read from input during the loop.**

The code `num = 0` sets the variable `num` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
