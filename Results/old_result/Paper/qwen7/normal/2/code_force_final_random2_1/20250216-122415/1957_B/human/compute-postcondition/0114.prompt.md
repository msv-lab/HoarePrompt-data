You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)
        
    #State: Output State: All test cases have been processed; `t` is now the total number of test cases; for each test case, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer; `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer; `k0` is equal to the original `k` for each test case; `arr` is either an empty list or a list of length `n` depending on the value of `n`; `ans` is a list containing either two or three elements depending on the value of `n`, where the elements are calculated based on the logic inside the loop; `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) for each test case; `i` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 for each test case, indicating the number of times `temp` was doubled before breaking the loop.
    #
    #This output state describes the final conditions after all iterations of the loop have completed, with each variable reflecting its state after processing all test cases according to the given logic.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, there are two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The function returns different values based on the conditions given for `n` and `k` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
