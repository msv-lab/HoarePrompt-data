Output State: `a3` is the first integer from the input split for each iteration, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split for each iteration, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, `m` is exactly `n-3`, and `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, and `n` retain their initial values as described in the initial state.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `val` will contain a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of an `a3` value and a list `l3` corresponding to each input line provided, up to `m-2` times. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state since they are not affected by the loop.
