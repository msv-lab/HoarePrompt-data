Output State: **`final` is an empty list with an additional element 0 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` remains an empty list; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an integer divided by 2 to get `pk`; `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The code `pk = n // 2` divides the value of `n` by 2 using integer division and assigns the result to `pk`. The values of `final`, `t`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
