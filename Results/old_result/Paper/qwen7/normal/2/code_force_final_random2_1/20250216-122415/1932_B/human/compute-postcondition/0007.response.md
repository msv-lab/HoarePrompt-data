Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 3, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list.**

The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 2, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 3. The values of `results`, `t`, `data`, and `n` remain unchanged.
