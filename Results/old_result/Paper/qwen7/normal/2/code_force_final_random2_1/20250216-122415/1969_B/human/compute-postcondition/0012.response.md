Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list, `c` is the first element in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt[0]` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` if `c` is not 0.
