### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` handle the problem as described. Let's break down the analysis further to ensure there are no overlooked details or potential issues.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function aims to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row while ensuring the distance constraint is met.
   - The logic iterates through the row and updates the cost of placing supports based on the minimum cost found in the previous segment of length \( d \).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the entire grid and builds bridges on consecutive rows.
   - It reads the dimensions and the grid from input.
   - For each row, it calls `func_1` to get the minimum cost for that row.
   - It then iterates over possible starting rows for the bridges and sums the costs for each set of \( k \) consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly initializes the cost for the first support in column 1.
   - It then iteratively updates the cost for each subsequent cell, ensuring the distance constraint is maintained.
   - The use of a sliding window approach to find the minimum cost for placing supports is appropriate and efficient.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly reads the input dimensions and the grid.
   - It processes each row using `func_1` to get the minimum cost for that row.
   - The iteration over possible starting rows for the bridges and the summation of costs for each set of \( k \) consecutive rows is logically sound.
   - The final printing of the minimum total cost is correct.

### Potential Edge Cases and Considerations:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the edge case where the first and last columns have a depth of 0, which is correct.
  - The sliding window approach in `func_1` ensures that the distance constraint is met, which is crucial for the problem.

- **General Correctness:**
  - The overall logic of the program is consistent with the problem requirements.
  - The functions are well-defined and the implementation is straightforward.

### Conclusion:

After a thorough review, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the solution to the problem. There are no logical errors or overlooked details that would invalidate the program.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
