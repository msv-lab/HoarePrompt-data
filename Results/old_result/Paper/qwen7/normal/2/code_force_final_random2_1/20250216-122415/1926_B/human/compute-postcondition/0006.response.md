Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 0 within the loop itself, so its initial state before the loop starts is irrelevant.
   - `n` is a variable that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since `range(n)` includes values from 0 to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the given states**:
   - The initial state of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are not relevant to the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
