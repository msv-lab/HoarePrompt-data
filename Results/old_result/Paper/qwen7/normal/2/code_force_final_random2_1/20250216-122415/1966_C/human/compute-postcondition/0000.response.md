Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. This integer is assigned to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is maintained, and no other variables are affected by this operation.
