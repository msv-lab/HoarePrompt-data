Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of triples (n, x, y, a), where n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, x and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, x, y = case['params']
    a = case['array']
    freq = {}
    beautiful_count = 0
    print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
    for num in a:
        mod_x = num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
        required_mod_y = mod_y
        print(
            f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
            )
        if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
            beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
        if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
    print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
    results.append(beautiful_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `beautiful_count`; `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i; `beautiful_count` reflects the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the frequency dictionary `freq` during the loop's execution; `mod_x` is the remainder when the last `num` in `a` is divided by `x`; `mod_y` is the remainder when the last `num` in `a` is divided by `y`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`; `freq` is updated to count the occurrences of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an empty array, `beautiful_count` contains the total count of numbers that meet the specified conditions across all iterations, `freq` holds the count of numbers that have specific `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs as their remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, and `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]` for each iteration where `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq` is true, plus the initial value it started with (which was 0); `freq` dictionary will have counts updated for each unique pair of `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered during the iterations; `mod_x` and `mod_y` will be the remainders when the last number in `a` is divided by `x` and `y` respectively; `required_mod_x` will be `(x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y` will be `mod_y`; `a` must have at least one element, and `test_cases` must contain at least one more element as per the initial state; `results` list will have the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
