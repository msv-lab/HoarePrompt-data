None of the variables in the function `func_1()` are provided in the function signature. However, the function reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k` for each test case. The input format is structured as described in the problem statement.
