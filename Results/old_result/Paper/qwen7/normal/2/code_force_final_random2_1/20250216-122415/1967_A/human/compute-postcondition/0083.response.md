Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by (2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2]), `r` is a[3]**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 2, `r` becomes `a[2 + 1]`, which is `a[3]`. The other variables (`ii`, `n`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
