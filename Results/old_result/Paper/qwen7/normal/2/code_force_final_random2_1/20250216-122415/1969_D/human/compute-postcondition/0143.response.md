Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, `combined` does not contain the last popped item (`item`), `removed_item` is the last element popped from `combined`, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` is set to `current_profit` if `current_profit > max_profit`.**

In this output state, the variable `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the value of `removed_item[0]`. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values as described in the initial state.
