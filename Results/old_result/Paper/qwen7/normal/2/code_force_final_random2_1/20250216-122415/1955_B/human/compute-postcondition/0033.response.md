Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is equal to `n-1`, `li` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, each calculated as `a + n * c, a + (n-1) * c + d, a + (n-2) * c + 2d, ..., a + d * (n-1)`**.

Explanation: The list `li` was initially populated with elements calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. After the loop completed, `k` became equal to `n` and `h` became `n-1`. Sorting the list `li` rearranges its elements in ascending order. The sorted list `li` now contains the elements `[a + n * c, a + (n-1) * c + d, a + (n-2) * c + 2d, ..., a + d * (n-1)]` in ascending order.
