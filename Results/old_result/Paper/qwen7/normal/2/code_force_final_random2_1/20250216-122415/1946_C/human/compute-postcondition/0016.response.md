Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the elements at indices `a` and `b` which now contain `[b, a]` and `[a, b]` respectively, where `a` and `b` are the integers from the inputs corresponding to each iteration of the loop, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the same as before, and `adj[a].append(b)` and `adj[b].append(a)` have been executed for every pair `(a, b)` provided by the input.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the adjacency list `adj` will represent a graph where each edge between nodes `a` and `b` is bidirectional, and the variables `t`, `x`, `R`, `z`, `k`, `i`, and `n` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
