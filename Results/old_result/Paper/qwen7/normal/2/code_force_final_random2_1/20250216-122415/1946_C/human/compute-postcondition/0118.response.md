Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is `(1 + 100001) // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`, which simplifies to `(1 + 100001) // 2`. Since both `L` and `R` are integers, the division operation will result in an integer. Therefore, `x` is calculated as `50001`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
