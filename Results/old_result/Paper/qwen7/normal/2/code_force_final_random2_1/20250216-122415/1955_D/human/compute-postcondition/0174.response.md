Output State: **Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must have at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element, and `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2. Specifically, if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1`. If `D[out_aa]` was less than or equal to 0, then `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 2` and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. Moreover, `C[out_aa]` is set to 1. Additionally, `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0. `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `E[in_aa] += 1` increments the value of `E[in_aa]` by 1. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged. Therefore, the postconditions related to `D[out_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `C[in_aa]`, `aa[m:]`, and `aa[:n - m]` still hold true.
