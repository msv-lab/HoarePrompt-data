Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input. It splits the input string into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3`. The rest of the integers are collected into a list `l3`. The initial values of `a3` and `l3` depend on the input provided by the user, but the structure of the variables remains as described.
