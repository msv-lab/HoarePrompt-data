Output State: **`index` is 4 + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| â‰¤ `n` and sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is an empty list, `p` is now a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is updated by adding `n` to its current value, which was initially 4. All other variables remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
