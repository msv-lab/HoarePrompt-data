### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum into the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The key insight is that we can always insert the sum of the entire array multiple times without changing the overall sum. This is because the sum of the array remains the same regardless of where we insert the sums.
   - Therefore, the optimal strategy is to first compute the sum of the array and then repeatedly double this sum `k-1` times (since the first insertion doesn't change the sum but subsequent ones do).

3. **Steps in the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and computes the initial sum `s`.
   - It calculates the maximum prefix sum `t` (which is the maximum subarray sum).
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to \((s + t) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, it doubles the value of `t` and adds it to `ans`, taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly handles the doubling of the sum and the addition of these sums to the initial sum.
   - The use of modulo arithmetic ensures that the result stays within the required bounds.
   - The code correctly processes all test cases as per the problem statement.

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles all edge cases and performs the necessary operations as described.
