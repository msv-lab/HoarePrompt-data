Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop is defined as follows:
  ```python
  for _ in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```
- At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that the loop has completed all its iterations.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head does not explicitly mention any variables being modified or used within the loop itself. However, the loop runs for `n` iterations, where `n` is a variable that determines the number of iterations.
2. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop runs for `n` iterations and completes all of them, `n` must have been decremented to zero during each iteration until it reaches zero. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n`.

### Conclusion:
- Since the loop has completed all its iterations, `n` must now be zero (or less, but typically loops stop when `n` reaches zero).

### Updated State:
- `ans` remains unchanged because the loop has already completed all its iterations.
- `n` must now be zero.

### Final Answer:
State: **`ans` is the sum of the two components, `n` is 0**
