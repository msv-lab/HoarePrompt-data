Output State: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `mexsize` is `t`, `sz` is the last element in the list `a`, `tc` is `t - 1`, and `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `mexsize` will be incremented by 1 for each element in the list `a`. Since the loop continues as long as `sz` (which iterates through each element in `a`) is equal to `mexsize`, and given that `mexsize` starts from 1 and increments by 1 for each iteration, it will eventually reach the length of the list `a` plus one. Therefore, `mexsize` will be equal to the length of the list `a` plus one, which is also the value of `t`. At the end of the loop, `sz` will be the last element in the list `a`, `tc` will still be `t - 1`, and `maxsize` will remain the maximum value in the list `a`.
