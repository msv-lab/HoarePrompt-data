You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

    #State: Output State: `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is ((((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t % MOD) * (2^k - 1)) % MOD, `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`, `t` is `2^k * t % MOD`.
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `k-1` since the loop runs from `0` to `k-2`. The variable `t` will be updated to `2^k * t % MOD` because it gets multiplied by `2` in each iteration. The variable `ans` accumulates the value of `t` in each iteration, starting from `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD` and adding `t` for each iteration, resulting in `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t % MOD) * (2^k - 1)`. The variable `a` remains an empty list as it is not affected by the loop, and `tmp` remains equal to `t` as it is not reassigned within the loop. Finally, `ans` is taken modulo `MOD` to ensure it stays within the required range.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` with length `n`, and two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates a result based on the sum of the list `a`, the maximum subarray sum starting from any point, and the value of `2^k % MOD`. The final output is the accumulated value of `t` for `k` iterations, adjusted by the initial sum and maximum subarray sum, all taken modulo `1000000007`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum into the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The key insight is that we can always insert the sum of the entire array multiple times without changing the overall sum. This is because the sum of the array remains the same regardless of where we insert the sums.
   - Therefore, the optimal strategy is to first compute the sum of the array and then repeatedly double this sum `k-1` times (since the first insertion doesn't change the sum but subsequent ones do).

3. **Steps in the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and computes the initial sum `s`.
   - It calculates the maximum prefix sum `t` (which is the maximum subarray sum).
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to \((s + t) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, it doubles the value of `t` and adds it to `ans`, taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly handles the doubling of the sum and the addition of these sums to the initial sum.
   - The use of modulo arithmetic ensures that the result stays within the required bounds.
   - The code correctly processes all test cases as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles all edge cases and performs the necessary operations as described.

### Correctness:
