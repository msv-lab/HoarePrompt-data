Output State: `i` is 5, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 'aaa', `j` is 3.

Explanation: The loop runs for 3 iterations as given. After each iteration, `j` increments and the `temp` string concatenates with the next character in the sequence. Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop runs 3 times, it will eventually reach 3. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` remains 5 (since it increments by 1 after the loop starts), `cases` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged), `temp` will be 'aaa' (after 3 iterations of appending characters), and `j` will be 3 (the final value after the last iteration).
