Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `beautiful_count` is 0, `a` is now set to the array from `case['array']`, `n` is unchanged, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(
        f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
        )
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a non-empty array with at least one element, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the frequency of (mod_x, mod_y) in `freq` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a non-empty array with at least one element (excluding the first element), `mod_y` is equal to `required_mod_y`, which is equal to `mod_y`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, and the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a non-empty array with at least one less element (excluding the first element), `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is incremented by 1, and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
