Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(bets)`. The relevant variables here are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < bets`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`.
   - `i` is less than `bets`.
   - `bets` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `bets`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `sumo` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `bets` remains the same.

So, the new state is:

State: **`sumo` is increased by int(a[i]), `i` is less than bets, `bets` is a positive integer, and i is incremented by 1**.

However, to fit the exact format requested, we can simplify it to:

State: **`sumo` is increased by int(a[i]), `i` is less than bets, `bets` is a positive integer, and i is 1 more than its previous value**.

But to strictly adhere to the format given in the examples:

State: **`sumo` is increased by int(a[i]), `i` is 1 more than its previous value, `bets` is a positive integer**.
