Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `lst`. The condition for the loop to continue is that there are elements left in `lst`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `lst` is `[5, n - 1]`.
   - `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - 5))`.
   - `ele` is `5`.

4. **Determine the Next Element to Process**:
   - Since `ele` is currently `5`, the next element in `lst` would be `n - 1`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `lst` will now be `[n - 1]` because the current element `5` has been processed.
   - `ele` will be `n - 1` for the next iteration.
   - `mini` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `lst` must now be a list containing only `n - 1`.
   - `mini` remains the same.
   - `ele` is updated to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`lst` is `[n - 1]`, `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - 5))`, `ele` is `n - 1`**
