Postcondition: `zero` remains unchanged, `one` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (previous_i + 2)), `one_perc` remains unchanged (if the if condition is not met), `lst` now contains `i + 1` where `i` is `previous_i + 2`, `one_perc` is updated to math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)) if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50.
