Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`, `tmp` remains unchanged if it was less than 0, otherwise it remains the same.**

This means that `t` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value (`t`) and `tmp`. If `tmp` was less than 0 before the operation, it remains 0; otherwise, `tmp` stays the same.
