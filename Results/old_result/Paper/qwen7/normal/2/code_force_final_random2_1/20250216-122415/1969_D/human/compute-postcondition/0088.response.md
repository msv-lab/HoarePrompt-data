Output State: **`combined` is an empty list, `max_profit` holds the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop's execution, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `current_profit` is 0, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

The code `bonuses = list(func_2())` assigns the return value of the function `func_2()` to the variable `bonuses`. Since `func_2()` returns two values, `n` and `k`, and the code specifies that `bonuses` is assigned the list returned by `func_2()`, `bonuses` will be a list containing these two values. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
