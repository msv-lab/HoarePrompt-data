Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `c` equals `r` plus twice the number of times `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `c` and `r` are the last integers read from input during the loop, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `dp[2] = 3` sets the second element of the list `dp` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
