Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 20.
   - `idx` is 19.
   - `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
   - `k` is an input integer (unchanged).
   - `nums` is a list containing elements `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048577, k + nums[idx] + 1]`.

2. **List Construction:**
   - The list `nums` starts with the sequence `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048577]`.
   - The last element of the list is `k + nums[idx] + 1`, where `idx` is 19.
   - Therefore, the last element is `k + 1048577 + 1 = k + 1048578`.

3. **Length of the List:**
   - The length of the list `nums` is the number of elements it contains.
   - The list starts with 22 elements and ends with one additional element, making it a total of 23 elements.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(len(nums))`.
   - Since the length of `nums` is 23, the print statement will output 23.

Output: **23**
