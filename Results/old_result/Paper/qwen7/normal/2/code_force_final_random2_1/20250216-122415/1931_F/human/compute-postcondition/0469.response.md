Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is explicitly given as 3.
- `val` is a list containing exactly 3 tuples, each tuple is of the form (`a3`, `l3`).
- The current value of `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that generates a list of elements from `l` where each element is not equal to `a3`.

The print statement is simply `print('no')`.

Given this information, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `m`, `val`, `a3`, or `l3`. It directly prints the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
