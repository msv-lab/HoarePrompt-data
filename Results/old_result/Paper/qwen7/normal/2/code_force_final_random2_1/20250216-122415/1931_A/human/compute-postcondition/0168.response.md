Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `cases`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < cases`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[3][2] + 96` for each iteration of the loop.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, the loop has completed 3 iterations.
   - The loop will stop when `i` reaches the value of `cases`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4.
   - `cases` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `j` will be updated to the next value, which would be 3 (since `j` is typically used to track the current iteration).
   - `temp` will contain the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[3][2] + 96` for the fourth iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `cases` must be greater than 0, `j` is 3, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[3][2] + 96` for the fourth iteration.**
