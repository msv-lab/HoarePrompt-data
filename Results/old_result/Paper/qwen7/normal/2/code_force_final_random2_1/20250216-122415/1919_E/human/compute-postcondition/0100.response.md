Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `2 * n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) filled with zeros.
   - `dp` is defined.
   - `j` is \(k + 1\).
   - If `dp[j] > 0` and \(j - 1\) is within the bounds of the list (i.e., \(j - 1 \geq 0\) and \(j - 1 \leq 2 \times n\)), then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\).
   - If \(j - 1\) is out of bounds, no updates are made to `new_dp`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be \(k + 2\).

5. **Check if the new value of `j` is within the bounds**:
   - The bounds for `j` are from `0` to \(2 \times n\).
   - Therefore, \(j = k + 2\) must be within these bounds.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `new_dp` remains unchanged as it is not modified outside the loop.
   - `dp` remains defined.
   - `j` is now \(k + 2\).

7. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `new_dp` is still a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) filled with zeros.
   - `dp` is still defined.
   - `j` is now \(k + 2\).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) filled with zeros, `dp` is defined, `j` is \(k + 2\)**.
