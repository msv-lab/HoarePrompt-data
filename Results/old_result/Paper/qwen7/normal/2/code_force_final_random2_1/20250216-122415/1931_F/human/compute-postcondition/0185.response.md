Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1**.

The code initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, both to -1. This assignment does not depend on any previous values or conditions, so the only change is the direct assignment of -1 to both variables. All other variables (`a2`, `l2`, `n`, `m`, `val`, `a1`, `l1`, `l11`, `l22`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
