Output State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, and `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`, `case` is now the input string from the user, `a` is updated to a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `a` by converting each digit in the `case` string to an integer and filtering out non-digit characters. The other variables (`b`, `ma`, `new_median`, and `op`) remain unchanged. The `case` string is updated to the input string from the user.
