Output State: **`no` is a list with an additional element `a`, `num` is 0, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise it is an empty list, `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise it contains either `a` (if `x` is 1) or `a` (if `x` is 2), `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `no` becomes a list that includes its original elements plus the new element `a`. The values of `num`, `big`, `less`, `iterable2`, `x`, and `a` remain as they were initially.
