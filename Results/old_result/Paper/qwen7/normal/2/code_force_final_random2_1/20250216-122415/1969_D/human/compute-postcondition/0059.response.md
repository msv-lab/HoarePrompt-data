Output State: **`combined` is now one item shorter, `item` is the last element of `combined` before it was popped, `heap` contains the new item, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of the last item of the original `combined` if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`.**

Explanation: The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs two operations:
1. It pushes the `item` onto the heap.
2. It pops the smallest element from the heap and returns it.

Before the operation, `combined` is one item longer, and `item` is the last element of `combined` before it was popped. After the operation, `combined` is one item shorter because the last item (which is `item`) was removed from the heap. The `heap` now contains the new smallest element, which is the `removed_item`.

Based on the postconditions, if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of the last item of the original `combined`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`.
