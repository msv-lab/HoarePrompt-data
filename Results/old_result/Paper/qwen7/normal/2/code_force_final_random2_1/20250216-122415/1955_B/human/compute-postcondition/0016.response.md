Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `h`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs for `h` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `h < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `h` is 1
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive
   - `k` is 1
   - `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and it has appended the value `a + k * c + d * h`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `h` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `h` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `k` remains 1 since it is not modified within the loop.
   - The list `li` will now contain the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1` (which is now 2), and it will have appended the value `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` = 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`h` is 2, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `k` is 1, `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to 2, and `li` has appended the value `a + k * c + d * 2`**.
