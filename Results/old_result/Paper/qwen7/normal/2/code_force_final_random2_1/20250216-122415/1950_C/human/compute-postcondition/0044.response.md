Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the integer part of the input split by `:` minus 12, `m` is the integer part of the input split by `:`.**

The code `h = h - 12` subtracts 12 from the value of `h`. The other variables (`t`, `day`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `h` is now `h - 12`.
