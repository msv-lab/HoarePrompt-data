Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `r` is the new input string from the user (though its value is not needed for this print statement)
- `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`
- `prev` is 1

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here's the breakdown of the values used in the print statement:
- `v1` is `n-1`
- `i` is 2
- `v1` again is `n-1`
- `prev` is 1

So, the print statement will output:
Output: **? [n-1] 2 [n-1] 1**
