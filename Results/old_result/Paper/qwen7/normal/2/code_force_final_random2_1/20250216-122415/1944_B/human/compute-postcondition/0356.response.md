Output State: **`k` is equal to -1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `len(l)` must be at least `n`, `ans2` contains the element `l[n + 1]`, `ans1` appends the element `l[n + 1]` to itself, and the loop breaks out of the iteration if `k` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is `n + 1`) from list `l` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is already set to `n + 1`, appending `l[i]` means `ans1` now contains two elements, both being `l[n + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
