Output State: The loop will execute `k + 1` times. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, and `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` will be calculated based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically:

- If `i` is 0, the first element in `ans` will be `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For subsequent iterations (from `i = 1` to `i = k`), each element in `ans` will be updated according to the following rules:
  - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the next element in `ans` will be the previous element plus `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
  - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the next element in `ans` will be the previous element plus `a[i - 1]`.

The final state of `ans` will be a list of length `k + 1`, with each element calculated as described above based on the values of `sum1`, `a`, and `x`.
