Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `new_median <= median`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `op` is 2
   - `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string
   - `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3
   - `ma` is either `int(num2 / 2) - 1` or `int(num2 / 2)`
   - `new_median` is decreased by at least 1
   - `median` is `b[ma] + 1`
   - `b` is explicitly sorted again (but remains the same)
   - `i` is `num`
   - `num2` is an input integer
   - `case` is the input string
   - `a` is updated to contain integers from `case` split and filtered
   - `median` is reassigned to `b[ma] + 1`
   - `new_median` is reassigned to `b[ma]`
   - `b[ma]` is increased by 1

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `new_median <= median` depends on `new_median` and `median`.
   - From the current states, we know:
     - `new_median` is decreased by at least 1.
     - `median` is `b[ma] + 1`.
     - `new_median` is reassigned to `b[ma]`.
     - `b[ma]` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `new_median` is reassigned to `b[ma]` and `b[ma]` is increased by 1, `new_median` will be increased by 1.
   - Therefore, `new_median` will no longer be less than or equal to `median` because `median` is `b[ma] + 1` and `new_median` is now `b[ma]`.
   - To allow the loop to execute one more time, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`. This means `new_median` should be set to a value that is less than or equal to `median`.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `new_median` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`**
