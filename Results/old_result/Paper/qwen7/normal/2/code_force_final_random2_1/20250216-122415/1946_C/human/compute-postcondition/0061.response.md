Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[b]` contains the value `[b, a]`**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contains the value `[a, b]`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will now contain `[b, a]` because `a` is appended to it. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
