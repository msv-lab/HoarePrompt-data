The function processes input values for variables `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` and determines the winner of a game based on these inputs. The function prints either "Alice", "Bob", or "draw" and does not return any value. Depending on the specific conditions met during execution, it may print "Alice" or "Bob" and return the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` (denoted as `t`), otherwise it prints "draw".
