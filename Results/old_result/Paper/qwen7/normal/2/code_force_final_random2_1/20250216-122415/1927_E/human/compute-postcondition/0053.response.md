Output State: `i` is 1, `k` is 2, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` (2) are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`, `len(permutation)` is at least 14, and the elements of `permutation` at indices that are multiples of `k` follow the pattern of being incremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop until all relevant indices are filled.

To break it down further:
- Initially, `permutation` starts with some elements set to consecutive integers starting from 2 at indices that are multiples of `k`.
- After the loop runs for 3 iterations, the next value to be assigned to `permutation` at the next multiple of `k` would be `curr_v + 1`, which is `len(permutation) + 7` (since `curr_v` was `len(permutation) + 7` after 3 iterations).
- The loop continues until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches or exceeds `len(permutation)`. Given the initial conditions and the loop's behavior, after all iterations, `permutation` will have its elements at multiples of `k` filled up to the length of the list, following the described increment pattern.
- Therefore, `curr_v` will be `len(permutation) + 7`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `len(permutation)`, indicating that all relevant indices have been processed.
