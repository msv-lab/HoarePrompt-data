Postcondition: **`combined` now contains all but the last element of its original contents, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit` before the pop operation, otherwise `max_profit` remains 0, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` contains all elements that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `current_profit` is updated based on the condition: if `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`**.
