Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of strings containing the split input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, and converts each string to a string (which is redundant since they are already strings). The resulting list of strings is assigned to `aa`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
