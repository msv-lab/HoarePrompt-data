Output State: **`j` is 0 or 1, `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` contains the element 26**.

The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Since `j` and `lex` were unaffected by this operation, their conditions remain the same. Therefore, `j` is still either 0 or 1, `lex` is still greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, and `arr` now contains the element 26.
