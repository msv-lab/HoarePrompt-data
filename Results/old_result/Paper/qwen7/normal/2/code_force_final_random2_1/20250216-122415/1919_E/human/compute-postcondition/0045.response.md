Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where for every index `j` from 1 to \(2 * n\) (inclusive), `new_dp[j]` is the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0`, modulo `MOD`, `i` is `m + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 * n + 1\) where each element is 0, and `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` for every `j` from 1 to \(2 * n\).**

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Since `new_dp` is initialized to a list of zeros and `i` is set to `m + 1`, these values remain unchanged. The condition `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` modifies `new_dp` based on the values of `dp`, but the overall structure and conditions for `new_dp` and `dp` remain as described in the initial state.
