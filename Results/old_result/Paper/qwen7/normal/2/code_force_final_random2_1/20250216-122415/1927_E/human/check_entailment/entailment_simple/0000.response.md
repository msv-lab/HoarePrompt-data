Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n.
2. A k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.
3. The provided solution uses a specific approach to generate the permutation:
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It fills the list at indices that are multiples of `k` with consecutive integers starting from 2.
   - This approach ensures that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` will either be the same or differ by 1, satisfying the k-level condition.
4. The code correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop in `func_2()` to repeatedly call `func_1()` for each test case.
5. The logic in `func_1()` is sound and should produce a valid k-level permutation for each test case.

Given this analysis, the provided program appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
