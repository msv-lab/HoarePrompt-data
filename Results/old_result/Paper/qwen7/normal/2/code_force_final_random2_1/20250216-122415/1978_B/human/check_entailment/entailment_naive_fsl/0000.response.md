Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules. 

- Function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given `k` value, which represents the number of buns sold at the modified price.
- Function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal `k` value that maximizes the profit.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` value is found efficiently, and `func_1` accurately computes the profit for any valid `k`.

Since the program correctly implements the required logic and handles all potential cases as described, it is correct.
