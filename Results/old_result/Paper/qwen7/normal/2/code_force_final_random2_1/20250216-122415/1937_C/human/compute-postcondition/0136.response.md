Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 2 (though the value of `n` itself is not needed for this specific print statement)
- `v2` is 3

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Here, `v1` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information. Therefore, `v1` remains as `v1` in the print statement.

The values of `v2` are explicitly given as 3.

So, the print statement will output:
Output: **? v1 v1 3 3**
