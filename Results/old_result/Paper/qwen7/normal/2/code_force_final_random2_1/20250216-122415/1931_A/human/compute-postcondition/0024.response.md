Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is either less than 27 or within the range [26, 78]; `arr` is a list containing the elements 26 and 1.**

The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contained the element 26. After appending 1, `arr` now contains both 26 and 1. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
