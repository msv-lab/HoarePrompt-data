Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples.
- During each iteration, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the current tuple in `val`.
- The current value of `l3` is not equal to a list obtained by iterating over `l` and excluding all elements that are equal to `a3`.

The `print('no')` statement simply prints the string `'no'` regardless of the values of `a3` and `l3`.

Output: **no**
