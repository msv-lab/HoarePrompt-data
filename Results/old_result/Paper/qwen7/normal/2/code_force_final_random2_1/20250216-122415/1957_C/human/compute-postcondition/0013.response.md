Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < k`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `num` is either 1 or 2
   - `i` is 0
   - `c` is an input integer
   - `r` is an input integer
   - If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1; otherwise, `num` is 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and if `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1; otherwise, `num` is 2.**
