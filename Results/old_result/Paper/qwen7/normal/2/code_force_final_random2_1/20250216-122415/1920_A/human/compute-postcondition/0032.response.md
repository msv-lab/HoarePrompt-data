Postcondition: `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and depending on the value of `x`, either `a` is added to the list `big` (if `x` equals 1) or `a` is added to the list `less` (if `x` equals 2). If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, the lists `big` and `less` remain unchanged.
