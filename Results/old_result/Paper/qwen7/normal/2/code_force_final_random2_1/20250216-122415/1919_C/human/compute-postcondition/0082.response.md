Postcondition: `x` is `y + 3`, `y` remains the same, `n` remains the same, and `l[x]` is updated to either `a` or `b` based on the conditions inside the loop. If `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, then `l[x]` is set to `a`; otherwise, if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `l[x]` is set to `a`; otherwise, if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `l[x]` is set to `a`; otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`.
