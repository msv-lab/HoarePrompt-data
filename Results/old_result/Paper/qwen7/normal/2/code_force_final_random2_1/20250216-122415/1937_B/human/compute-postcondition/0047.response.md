Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is the same value as before, `a` is a list of integers, the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `s`, and `t` is 0. If the first `i + 1` elements of `a` are equal to the first `i + 1` elements of `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
