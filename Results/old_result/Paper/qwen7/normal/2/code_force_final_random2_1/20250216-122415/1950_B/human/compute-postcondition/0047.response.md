Output State: **`c` is 1, `casos` must be a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that is either equal to 1 or not equal to 2, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`**.

This means that the variable `c` retains its initial value of 1, `casos` remains a positive integer greater than 0, and `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user through the input function. The condition that `n` is either equal to 1 or not equal to 2 is preserved.
