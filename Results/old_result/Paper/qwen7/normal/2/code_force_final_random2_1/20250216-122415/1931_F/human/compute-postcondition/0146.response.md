Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `a3` will be the first integer from the final input split.
- `l3` will be a list containing the remaining integers from the final input split.
- `val` will be a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`).
- `m - 2` will be equal to 0.

### Loop Head:
The loop iterates over each tuple in `val`:
```python
for (a3, l3) in val:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `a3`: This is the first element of the tuple being iterated over.
   - `l3`: This is the second element of the tuple being iterated over.
   - `val`: This is the list of tuples that the loop iterates over.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will iterate over each tuple in `val`.
   - Since `m - 2` is equal to 0, this implies that `m` is 2. Therefore, the loop will run exactly once because `m - 2` starts at 0 and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0.

### Required Adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `val` contains at least one tuple for the loop to execute at least once.
- `a3` and `l3` should be initialized to the values they will take on the first iteration of the loop.

Given these points, let's construct the required state:

### State After Adjustment:
- `val` must contain at least one tuple.
- `a3` should be the first element of the first tuple in `val`.
- `l3` should be the second element of the first tuple in `val`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`val` must contain at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`**
