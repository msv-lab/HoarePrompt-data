Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `D` is a Counter object counting the elements common to both `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `E` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_bb` but not in `D`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of strings containing the split input from the user, `bb` is a list of strings created from the split input, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; all other variables retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if either `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` and `E[out_aa] > 0`, or `pairs_in_D - 1` is greater than or equal to `k` and `D[out_aa] > 2`, or `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. In all other cases, `fnd` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1. If `C[in_aa] <= 0`, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. All other variables retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` remains unchanged; `pairs_in_D` may decrease by 1; `D[out_aa]` is unchanged; `D[in_aa]` may increase by 1; `E[out_aa]` and `E[in_aa]` may change as follows: if `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[in_aa]` may decrease by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
