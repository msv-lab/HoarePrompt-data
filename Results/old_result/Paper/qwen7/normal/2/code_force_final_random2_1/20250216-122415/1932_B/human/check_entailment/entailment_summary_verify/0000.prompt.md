You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if path[0] == '@':
        dp[0] = 1
    elif path[0] == '*':
        dp[0] = -float('inf')
    if n > 1:
        if path[1] == '*':
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
    return max((x for x in dp if x > -float('inf')))

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        path = data[index]
        index += 1
        results.append(func_1(path))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t sets of data. Each set includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. For each set, it calls `func_1(path)` to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the given periodicities and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the LCM for each set.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to calculate the year in which all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially, based on their periodicities. However, the given functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not implement this logic at all. Instead, they seem to be related to processing a string with `@` and `*` characters, which is unrelated to the problem description.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 3 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The first sign occurs every 2 years, so it will occur in years 2, 4, 6, etc.
  - The second sign occurs every 3 years, so it will occur in years 3, 6, 9, etc.
  - The third sign occurs every 4 years, so it will occur in years 4, 8, 12, etc.
  - The first sign occurs in year 2, so the second sign will start occurring from year 3. The second sign will occur in year 6, so the third sign will start occurring from year 7. The third sign will occur in year 12, so the next sign (if there were more) would start from year 13.
  - Therefore, the output should be 12.

However, the program will not produce this output because it is not designed to solve the problem described. Thus, the program is incorrect.
