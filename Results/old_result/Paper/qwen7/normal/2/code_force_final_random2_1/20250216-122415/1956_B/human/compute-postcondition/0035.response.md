Output State: **`ans` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that contains at least `n` elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element in `cnt` is incremented according to the frequency of each integer in `a`, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, and `n` is the input integer.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` sets the value of `ans` to 0. All other variables (`a`, `cnt`, `x`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
