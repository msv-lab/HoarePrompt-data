Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing two tuples of (`a3`, `l3`), `m` is 2**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple of `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple, which is (`a3`, `l3`). After executing `val.append((a3, l3))`, `val` now contains two tuples, both of which are (`a3`, `l3`). The values of `a3`, `l3`, and `m` remain unchanged.
