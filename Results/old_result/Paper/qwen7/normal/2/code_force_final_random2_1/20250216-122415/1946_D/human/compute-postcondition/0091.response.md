Output State: **`op` is now the result of `val` >> `i` & 1 ^ `op`, `a` is a list with at least one element, `ai` is `ai` ^ `val`, `val` remains unchanged, `t` is a list containing the element 0.**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`. The other variables (`op`, `a`, `i`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
