### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the program, particularly regarding the generation of the missing subsequence. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs two strings: `s1` and `s2`.
     - `s1` is built by including characters from `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - `s2` is built by taking every `k`th character from `s1` after removing duplicate characters.
   - It checks if `s1` has at least `n * k` characters. If so, it returns `True` and the appropriate substrings; otherwise, it returns `False` and the substrings.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic checks the output of `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "No" and generates a string of length `n` using characters not present in `s1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "Yes".

### Issues Identified:
1. **Character Generation for Missing Subsequence:**
   - The code tries to generate a missing subsequence by finding the first character `i` that is not in `s1` and creating a string of length `n` using this character.
   - However, this approach might not always work because it only considers one character at a time, and it doesn't ensure that the generated string is lexicographically minimal or maximal, which is required by the problem statement.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` does not handle edge cases well, such as when `s` is very short or when `k` is large compared to `n`.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` constructs `s1` by including characters from `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- It then constructs `s2` by taking every `k`th character from `s1` after removing duplicate characters.
- The function checks if `s1` has at least `n * k` characters. If so, it returns `True` and the appropriate substrings; otherwise, it returns `False` and the substrings.

#### Main Logic:
- If `func_1` returns `False`, the program prints "No" and generates a string of length `n` using characters not present in `s1`.
- If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints "Yes".

### Issues:
1. **Generating the Correct Missing Subsequence:**
   - The current approach to generating the missing subsequence is flawed. It only considers the first character not in `s1` and creates a string of length `n` using this character. This does not guarantee that the generated string is the lexicographically smallest or largest missing subsequence.
   - For example, if `s = 'abb'` and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the missing subsequence should be "aa", but the current implementation might generate "bb" instead.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` does not handle edge cases well, such as when `s` is very short or when `k` is large compared to `n`.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the provided examples again to see if the program works correctly:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  2 2 4
  abba
  2 2 3
  abb
  3 3 10
  aabbccabab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  NO
  aa
  NO
  ccc
  ```

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `s = 'abba'`
  - `func_1` will correctly identify that all possible strings of length 2 using 'a' and 'b' are subsequences of 'abba'.
  - Output: `YES`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `s = 'abb'`
  - `func_1` will identify that 'aa' is not a subsequence of 'abb'.
  - Output: `NO` and `'aa'`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `s = 'aabbccabab'`
  - `func_1` will identify that 'ccc' is not a subsequence of 'aabbccabab'.
  - Output: `NO` and `'ccc'`

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the examples correctly but has issues with generating the correct missing subsequence. The current implementation might not always produce the lexicographically smallest or largest missing subsequence as required by the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be modified to ensure that the generated missing subsequence is the lexicographically smallest or largest missing subsequence.
