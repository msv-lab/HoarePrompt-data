Output State: **`casos` is an input integer and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.**

Explanation: The code `casos = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `casos`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 20. The other variables (`n` and the precondition for `n`) are not defined yet and remain unaffected.
