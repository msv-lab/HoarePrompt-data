Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2)`. The only variables involved here are `m` and the range calculation `m - 2`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `m - 2` is now `m - 3`. This means that the value of `m` has decreased by 1 from its previous value.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `m - 2` is greater than or equal to 0. After each iteration, `m` decreases by 1, so `m - 2` decreases by 1 as well.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `m - 2` is now `m - 3`, for the loop to execute one more time, `m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, `m` must be at least 3 (since `m - 2 >= 0` implies `m >= 2 + 2 = 3`).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The input taken is not stored in any variable, so that part remains unchanged.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 3, and `m - 2` must be 2 (since it will decrease by 1 in the next iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **input is taken but not stored in any variable, and `m` must be at least 3**
