Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2 or 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are (1 << i) - 1 and k - ((1 << i) - 1), and `temp` is either 16, 8, or 4.**

Explanation: The code appends `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element `(1 << i) - 1`. The sum of `ans` is `(1 << i) - 1`. Therefore, `k - sum(ans)` becomes `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, and `temp` remain unchanged.
