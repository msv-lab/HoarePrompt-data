Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `L`, `i`, `n`, `R`, `x`, and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states.
