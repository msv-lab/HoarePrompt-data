Output State: **`t` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `bets`, `prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets-1`, `sumo` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sumo` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `bets`, `i`, or `prod`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. `sumo` is explicitly set to 0.
