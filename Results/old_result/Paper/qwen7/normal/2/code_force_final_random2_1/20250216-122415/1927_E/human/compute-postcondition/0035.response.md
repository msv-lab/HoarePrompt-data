Output State: **`len(permutation)` is greater than 4; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is equal to `curr_v + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`. The other conditions and the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` remain unchanged.
