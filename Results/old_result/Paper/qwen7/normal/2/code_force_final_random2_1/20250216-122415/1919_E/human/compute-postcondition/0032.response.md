Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is the next element in `results`.
- `t` is the total number of iterations, which is the length of `results`.
- `n` is the integer from `data[3]`.
- `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration.
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.

The `print(res)` statement will print the next element in the `results` list. Since `res` is defined as the next element in `results`, it means `res` is the last element of the `results` list because the next element after all elements in the list would be the last one.

Therefore, the output will be the last element of the `results` list.

Output: **the last element of results**
