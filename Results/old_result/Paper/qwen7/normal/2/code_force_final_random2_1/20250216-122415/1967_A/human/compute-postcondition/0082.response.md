Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by (2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])`, which means `k` is decreased by `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`. The values of `ii`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
