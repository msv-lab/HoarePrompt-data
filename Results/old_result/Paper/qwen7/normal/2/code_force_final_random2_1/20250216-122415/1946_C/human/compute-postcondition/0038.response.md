Postcondition: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1), and `x` is now the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `R` is greater than `L` by more than 1. Otherwise, `R` is equal to `x`.
