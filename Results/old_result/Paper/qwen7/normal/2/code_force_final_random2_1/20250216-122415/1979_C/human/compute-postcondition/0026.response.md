Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `bets`.
- `sumo` will be increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]` + ... + the integer value of `a[bets-1]`.
- `bets` must be greater than 0.
- `a[i]` will be assigned the value of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `bets`.
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The print statement is simply `print(-1)`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or their values; it directly prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
