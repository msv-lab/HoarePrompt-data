Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, where a and b are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 ≤ a, b ≤ 99 and both are odd. It returns the sum of x and y, followed by the sum of y and y.**

This means the function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which represent the dimensions of a field. Both `a` and `b` must be odd integers within the range of 3 to 99. The function then returns two values: the first is the sum of `x` and `y`, and the second is the sum of `y` and `y`.
