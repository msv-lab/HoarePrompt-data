Output State: `i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2()` + 1.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `cnt` will have been decremented to 0, and `l` will be equal to `func_2()` + 1. The value of `i` remains 2, `n` remains 1, and `k` remains 1 since these variables are not affected by the loop. The condition for the loop to continue (`cnt != 0 or l < n + 1`) will no longer be satisfied when `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` is at least `n + 1`. Therefore, the loop terminates, and the final state of the variables inside the loop's scope is as described.
