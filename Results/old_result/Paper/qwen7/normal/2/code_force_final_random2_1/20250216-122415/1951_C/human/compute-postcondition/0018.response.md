Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` in the range of `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` must still be greater than 0. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
