Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (as per the `range(n - 1)`).
   - `n` is an integer from the first space-separated input.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(n - 1):` will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. This means that the loop will run `n - 1` times.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, it is already set correctly.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since `range(n - 1)` will run `n - 1` times, and if `n` is 1, the range would be `range(0)`, which is empty).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list.**
