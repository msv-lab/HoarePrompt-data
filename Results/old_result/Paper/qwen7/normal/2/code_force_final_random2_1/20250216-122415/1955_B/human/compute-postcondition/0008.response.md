Output State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 2, `li` is a list containing the value `a + d + 2 * 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given that `k` is 0 and `h` is 2, the expression simplifies to `a + 0 * c + d * 2`, which further simplifies to `a + d * 2` or `a + 2 * d`. Therefore, the list `li` now contains the value `a + 2 * d`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
