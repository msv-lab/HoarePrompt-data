Output State: **`min_indices` is `[0]`, `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, 0)`, `i` is `0`, `n` is greater than `0`.**

Explanation: The code `min_indices = [i]` updates the list `min_indices` by setting its first element to the current value of `i`, which is `0`. All other variables (`res`, `i`, `n`, and `max_index`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
