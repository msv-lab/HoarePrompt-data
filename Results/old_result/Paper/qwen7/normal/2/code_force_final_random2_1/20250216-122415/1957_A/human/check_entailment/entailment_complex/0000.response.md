Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks without breaking any of them.
2. A regular polygon with \( k \) sides requires \( k \) sticks of the same length.
3. The provided code correctly calculates the frequency of each stick length.
4. The function then sums up the integer division of each frequency by 4 because a quadrilateral (the simplest polygon with 4 sides) is the smallest regular polygon, and each division by 4 represents the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed with the available sticks of that particular length.
5. The logic in the function ensures that no stick is used more than once across different polygons, which aligns with the problem statement.
6. The function handles the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) appropriately.

Given the above points, the provided solution correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
