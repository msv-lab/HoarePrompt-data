Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. It sorts the array in descending order, which is a good approach for Alice's strategy of removing the smallest elements first.
3. The program then iterates through possible values of \(i\) from 0 to \(k\), calculating sums based on the following logic:
   - If \(i = 0\), it calculates the sum of the array minus twice the sum of the first \(x\) elements.
   - For other values of \(i\), it updates the sum by adding the \(i\)-th smallest element and subtracting twice the \((i + x - 1)\)-th smallest element.
   - If \(i + x - 1\) is beyond the length of the array, it simply adds the \(i\)-th smallest element.
4. The program stores these sums in a list `ans` and prints the maximum value from this list, which represents the optimal sum after both players have made their moves.

Given the logic and the steps taken by the program, it aligns with the problem statement and the optimal strategies for both players. Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
