You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Program:
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`. For each `n` within the range 1 to 4, it prints a specific pattern. If `n` is 1, it prints two lines of double hashes. If `n` is 2, it prints four lines with alternating double hashes and dots. If `n` is 3, it prints six lines with a more complex alternating pattern. If `n` is 4, it prints eight lines with an even more intricate pattern. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value; it only outputs the patterns based on the input values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate a 2n x 2n checkerboard where each 2x2 block alternates between `#` and `.`. The top-left cell should be `#`.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`casos`) and processes each test case individually.

3. **Checkerboard Generation**:
   - For `n = 1`, the output is correct.
   - For `n = 2`, the output is correct.
   - For `n = 3`, the output is correct.
   - For `n = 4`, the output is correct.
   
4. **Handling Larger Values**: The program incorrectly handles values of `n` greater than 4 by printing "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range"). However, the problem description does not specify how to handle values outside the range [1, 4]. Since the problem asks for a 2n x 2n checkerboard and provides examples for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`, we can assume that the checkerboard pattern should be extended logically for larger `n`.

5. **Pattern Extension for Larger `n`**:
   - For `n > 4`, the checkerboard pattern should repeat the 4x4 pattern in a consistent manner. The existing code does not extend this pattern correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not provide a generalized solution for `n > 4`. It only handles specific cases up to `n = 4` and fails to extend the pattern logically for larger values of `n`.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
