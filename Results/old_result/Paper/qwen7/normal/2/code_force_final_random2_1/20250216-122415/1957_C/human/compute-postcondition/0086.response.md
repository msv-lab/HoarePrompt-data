Output State: **`dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `i` is at least 3, `m` is at least `k - 3`**.

This means that the value of `dp[i]` has been updated according to the formula provided, while the values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged and satisfy their respective conditions.
