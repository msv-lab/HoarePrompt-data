Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in lst:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `lst` has at least one element.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must have at least one element.
   - `pk` and `elem` are compared within the loop body.
   - `mini` is the minimum absolute difference found so far.
   - `final` is updated if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `lst` must have at least one element for the loop to continue, and assuming the loop just finished an iteration (meaning `lst` had at least one element before the current iteration), `lst` will now have one less element.
   - `elem` will be the current element being processed in the loop.

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- `lst` must have at least one element minus one (since one element was processed in the previous iteration).
- `elem` will be the next element in `lst`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `lst`**
