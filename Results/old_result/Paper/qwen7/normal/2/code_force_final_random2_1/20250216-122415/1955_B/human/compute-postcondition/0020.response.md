Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `k` will be equal to `n`, `h` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` will still be between 2 and 500 inclusive, and `li` will be a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, with each element updated by the loop as `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- `k` will be equal to `n`.
- `h` will be equal to `n-1`.
- `n` will remain between 2 and 500.
- `li` will be a list of length `n`, where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for each `h` from 0 to `n-1` and each `k` from 0 to `n-1`.
