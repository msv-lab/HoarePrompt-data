Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between \(k\) and \(2k\), `i` is \(k-1\), `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., `i` goes from 0 to \(k-1\)), the value of `num` will be the sum of either 1 or 2 for each iteration, depending on whether `c` equals `r`. Since the loop runs `k` times, `num` will be in the range from \(k\) to \(2k\). The variable `i` will be set to \(k-1\) after the last iteration. The values of `t`, `n`, `c`, and `r` remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop.
