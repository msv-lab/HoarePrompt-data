Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The relevant variables here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `max` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`.
   - There is a postcondition: if `min(a[2], a[1]) > max`, then `max` remains unchanged.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, the loop will continue if `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 3.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `max` is determined by the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`. Since no new information about `a[2]` or `a[1]` is given, `max` remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `max` remains the same (the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `max` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`, `n` must be the same as before**
