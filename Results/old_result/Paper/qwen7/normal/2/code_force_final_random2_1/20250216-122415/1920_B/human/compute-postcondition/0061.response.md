Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; `ans` contains the value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `k`, and the condition involving `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `sums` is updated but not explicitly shown here, and `ans` now includes the latest value of `sums`.
