Output State: **`flag` is 1; the character at index `i` of string `s` is '-' and the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is '1'.**

The value of `flag` is explicitly set to 1, which changes its state from 0. The characters at index `i` and `i + 1` of string `s` remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify these characters.
