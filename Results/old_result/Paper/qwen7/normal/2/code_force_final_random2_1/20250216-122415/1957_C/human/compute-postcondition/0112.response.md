Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `c` is the first integer from the input split by space, `r` is the second integer from the input split by space, and `num` is `num + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Since `num` was previously either `c + 1` if `c` equals `r`, or `num + 2` if `c` does not equal `r`, the new value of `num` is updated to `num + 2`. The values of `i`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged.
