Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Spending:**
   - The logic `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is not correctly calculating the minimum spending. The term `- s * s / 2` is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - The formula should simply be `c += l[i] * s`.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - Sorting the list `l` before processing is not necessary and can be omitted since the algorithm needs to consider the original order of prices.

3. **Incorrect Use of `k * k / 2`:**
   - The variable `c = k * k / 2` is not used correctly and seems to be a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

4. **Logic for Purchasing Tickets:**
   - The logic `s = min(m, k)` and `k -= s` is almost correct but should be adjusted to ensure that `k` is always non-negative and the number of tickets purchased does not exceed `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        total_cost = 0
        remaining_tickets = k
        
        for price in l:
            if remaining_tickets == 0:
                break
            max_tickets_today = min(m, remaining_tickets)
            total_cost += max_tickets_today * price
            remaining_tickets -= max_tickets_today
            price += max_tickets_today
        
        print(total_cost)
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum spending is calculated correctly by iterating through the days and purchasing the maximum possible tickets each day until the required number of tickets (`k`) is met.
