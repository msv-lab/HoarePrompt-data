Output: **1**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and n is equal to k. The print statement simply outputs the integer 1, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`. Since the specific values of `n` and `k` are not needed to determine the output of the print statement, the output is simply 1.
