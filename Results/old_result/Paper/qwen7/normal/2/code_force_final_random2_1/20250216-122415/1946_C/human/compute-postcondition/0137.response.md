Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is `x`.**

Explanation: The variable `L` is assigned the value of `x`. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial state. `leftover` is the return value of the function `dfs(1, 1)`, and `numCuts` is still 0.
