Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute as long as `n > 1`. This is because `range(1, n)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, and the loop starts with `i = 1`, `i` needs to be adjusted to `1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `prev`, `r`, `g`, `kp`, `v1`, and `v2` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
