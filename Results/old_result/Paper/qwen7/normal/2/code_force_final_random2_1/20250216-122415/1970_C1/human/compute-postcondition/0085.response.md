Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) from standard input, followed by an integer `t` (where t = 1), and then two integers `u` and `v` (where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n). The tree represented has exactly two leaves. Based on the provided inputs, the function determines and returns whether the path from node `u` to node `v` passes through the root of the tree.**

This functionality describes the inputs and expected behavior of the function without detailing the internal operations.
