Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is either [1, 1, 1] or [1, 26, 1] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the end of the list `arr`. Since `arr` is either `[1, 1]` or `[1, 26]` based on the value of `lex`, after appending 1, `arr` becomes either `[1, 1, 1]` or `[1, 26, 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
