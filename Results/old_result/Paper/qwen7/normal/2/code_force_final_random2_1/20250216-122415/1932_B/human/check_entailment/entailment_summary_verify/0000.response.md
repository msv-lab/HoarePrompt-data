### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not follow the problem description. Let's break down the issues and verify the function summaries and the actual behavior of the code.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is designed to process a string containing `@` and `*` characters, which is unrelated to the problem of finding the year when all signs occur sequentially.
   - The function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities using a dynamic programming approach, but it is applied incorrectly to the string instead of the periodicities.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, as mentioned, `func_1` is not correctly implemented for the problem at hand.

Given the problem description, we need to find the year when all \( n \) signs occur sequentially based on their periodicities. The correct approach would involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities, not processing a string with special characters.

Let's consider the correct implementation:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_apocalypse_year(periods):
    return reduce(lcm, periods)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[1])
        periods = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version:
- Calculates the LCM of the periodicities using the `gcd` function and `reduce`.
- Reads input and processes multiple test cases correctly.

Since the original program does not match the problem description and does not implement the required logic, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to find the year when all signs occur sequentially based on their periodicities.
