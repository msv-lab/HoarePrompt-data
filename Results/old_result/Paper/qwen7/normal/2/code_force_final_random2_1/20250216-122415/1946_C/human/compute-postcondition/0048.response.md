Output State: `L` is equal to `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is `(L + R) // 2`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be satisfied because `R` and `L` will converge to the same value. At this point, the loop terminates. Given that `numCuts` remains 0 after the third iteration, it does not meet the condition to update `L` or `R` within the loop. Therefore, `L` and `R` will be equal to the final value of `x` calculated just before the loop exits. The value of `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, which effectively means `L` and `R` are the same. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their last state inside the loop.
