Output State: **`mak` is equal to the value of `i`, `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed, a string is read from input and its value is greater than the character '>'**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state's condition about reading a string from input and its value being greater than '>' remains unchanged. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call also remains unaffected.
