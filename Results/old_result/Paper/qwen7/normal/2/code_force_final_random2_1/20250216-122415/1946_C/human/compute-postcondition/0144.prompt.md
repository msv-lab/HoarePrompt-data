Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is 1, `R` is 100001.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `L` is equal to `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is `(L + R) // 2`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be true because `R` and `L` will converge to the same value. At this point, the loop terminates. Given that `numCuts` remains 0 after all iterations, and considering the logic inside the loop, `L` will eventually equal `R`. The value of `x` will be the last computed midpoint of `L` and `R`, which is `(L + R) // 2`. The values of `z`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `numCuts`, and `dfs(1, 1)`'s result (`leftover`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `L` is 50001, `R` is 50002, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `L` and `R` are updated based on the condition `if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x): L = x; else: R = x`. Given that `numCuts` remains 0 after the first three iterations, and since `R - L > 1` must hold true for the loop to continue, the value of `L` will eventually be set to 50001 after the third iteration, and `R` will be set to 50002. The variable `x` is calculated as the midpoint of `L` and `R`, which remains 50001. The value of `leftover` is the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)`, which does not change within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the binary search process will converge such that `L` and `R` will be equal. Given the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop, `L` and `R` both end up being 50001. The variable `numCuts` remains 0 because the condition `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)` was never met throughout the iterations. The variable `i` remains `n-2` as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `x` is set to the final value of `L` (or `R`) which is 50001. The variable `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is not modified by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
