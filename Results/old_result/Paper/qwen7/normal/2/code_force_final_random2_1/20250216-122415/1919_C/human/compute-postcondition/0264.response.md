Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is 6, `n` must be at least 6, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 6 in the list `l`, and `c` is 0. If `a` (which is the first element of the list `l`) is greater than or equal to the element at index 6 of the list `l`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` becomes the element at index 3 of the list `l`.
