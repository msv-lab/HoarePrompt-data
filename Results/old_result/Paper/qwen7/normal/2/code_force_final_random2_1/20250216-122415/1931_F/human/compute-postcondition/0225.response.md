Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 to become `k+2`, `idx1` is now `i`, `idx2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` is now 1, `p2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n` remains greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value `1` to `p1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
