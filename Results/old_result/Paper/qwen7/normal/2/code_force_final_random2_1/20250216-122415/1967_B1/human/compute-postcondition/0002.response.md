Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a string from input, `m` is a string from input**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into two strings and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Since the initial state of `t` is 0 and it is within the range (0, 10^4], the value of `t` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are set to the respective parts of the input string after splitting.
