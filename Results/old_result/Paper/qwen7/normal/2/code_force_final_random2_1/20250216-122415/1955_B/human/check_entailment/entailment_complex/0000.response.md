Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` first finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It then generates a list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
   - After generating `li`, both `l` and `li` are sorted.
   - Finally, it checks if the sorted list `l` is equal to the sorted list `li`. If they are equal, it returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

2. **Correctness**:
   - The logic ensures that the generated list `li` matches the expected sequence of numbers in a progressive square.
   - Sorting both lists before comparison is necessary because the original order of elements in `l` does not matter; only the values do.
   - The approach correctly identifies whether the given array can form a progressive square based on the provided formula.

Given the above analysis, the program is logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
