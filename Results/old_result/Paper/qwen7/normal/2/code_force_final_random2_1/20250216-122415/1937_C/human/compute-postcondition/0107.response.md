Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is an input from the user, and `prev` is '>', assuming `r` equals '>'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. The initial state of `i` and `n` remains unchanged. The value of `prev` is set to '>' because the condition `r == '>'` is assumed to be true, which matches the given initial state where `prev` is 2 if `r` equals '>', otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.
