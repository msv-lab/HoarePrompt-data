Output State: **`op` is 2, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 4`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted, `b` is sorted again which does not change its order.**

Explanation: The code `b[ma] += 1` increments the value of `b[ma]` by 1. Since `ma` is defined as either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, the value of `b[ma]` is increased by 1. Consequently, `new_median` (which is `b[ma] + 3`) becomes `b[ma] + 4`, and `median` (which is `b[ma]`) becomes `b[ma] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
