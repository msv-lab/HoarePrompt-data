The only variables in the loop head are `z` and `t`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables. According to the code, the loop continues as long as `R - L > 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `L` is equal to `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is `(L + R) // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `R` must be greater than `L` by at least 1.

Since `L` and `R` are equal at the end of the previous iteration, `R` must be incremented by 1 to satisfy the condition `R - L > 1`. The variable `z` must be set to 0 for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`L` is equal to `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `z` is 0, and `t` must be greater than 1**
