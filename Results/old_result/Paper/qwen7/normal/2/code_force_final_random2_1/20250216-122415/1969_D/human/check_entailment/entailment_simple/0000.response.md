### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1()` correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - `func_2()` correctly reads the values of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case, as well as the lists of prices \( a \) and bonuses \( b \).
   - `func_3()` calculates the total profit considering the conditions specified in the problem statement. It sums the first elements of the tuples in `secondary_heap` and adds the sum of `item[0] + item[1]` for all tuples in `primary_items` where `item[0] + item[1]` is non-negative.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in `func_4()` correctly initializes the necessary variables and structures.
   - It uses a min-heap (`heap`) to manage the items that are taken for free by Bob.
   - The items are sorted based on the bonuses \( b_i \) to prioritize the most beneficial items.
   - The code correctly handles the scenario where Bob takes \( k \) items for free and the remaining items are traded with Alice.
   - The logic for updating the maximum profit is sound and ensures that the optimal strategy is followed by both Alice and Bob.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when \( k = 0 \) (where Bob takes no items for free) and when \( k = n \) (where Bob takes all items for free).
   - The sorting and heap operations ensure that the algorithm considers the best possible outcomes for Alice.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum profit for each test case, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's profit under the given constraints and conditions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
