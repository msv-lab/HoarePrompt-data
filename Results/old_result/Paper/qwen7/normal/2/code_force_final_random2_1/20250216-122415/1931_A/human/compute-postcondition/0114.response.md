Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is [26], `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The code subtracts 26 from `lex`. Since `lex` was initially an input integer greater than or equal to 28, after subtracting 26, `lex` becomes an input integer greater than or equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
