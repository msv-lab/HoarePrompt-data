Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` contains an element that is equal to `a[1] - T[1]`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` appends to list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, this translates to appending `a[1] - T[1]` to `a`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
