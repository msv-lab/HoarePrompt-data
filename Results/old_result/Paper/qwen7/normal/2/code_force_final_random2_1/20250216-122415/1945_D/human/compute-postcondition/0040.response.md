Output State: **`i` is 4, `n - k` is 0, `soma_b` is equal to `lista_B[0] + lista_B[4]`, `resultado` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `(pref + lista_B[0] + lista_A[0])`**

Explanation: The code `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increments `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. Given that `i` was initially 3, after executing the code, `i` becomes 4. `soma_b` is updated to be `lista_B[0] + lista_B[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
