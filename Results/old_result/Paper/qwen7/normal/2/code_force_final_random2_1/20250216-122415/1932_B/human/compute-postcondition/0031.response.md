Output State: **`results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(path)` for all iterations, `t` is reduced to 0, `data` remains a list of strings with the length equal to the initial `t` times 2 plus the number of lines in `path`, `index` points to the position right after the last path value in the `data` list, `n` still holds the integer from the second line, and `path` holds the last path value from the `data` list.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `results` will contain the output of `func_1(path)` for each iteration. Since the loop runs for `t` times, `t` will be reduced to 0. The `data` list will remain unchanged in terms of its content but will have a length equal to the initial `t` times 2 plus the number of lines in `path`. The `index` will point to the position right after the last path value in the `data` list. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop. Lastly, `path` will hold the last path value from the `data` list.
