Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is less than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `arr` is a list (though its contents are not specified, this does not affect the output of the print statement).
- `ans` is `False`.

Let's break down the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]`:

- Since `ans` is `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][False]` will evaluate to `'NO'` because `False` corresponds to the first element in the list (index 0).

Therefore, the print statement will output `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
