Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `num_iterations` is defined as `prev_num_iterations - 1`. However, since `prev_num_iterations` is not explicitly given, we only know it is one less than the previous value, but we don't have the exact value. But for the print statement, we only need the current value of `mak` and `i`, which are explicitly given.
- `n` is stated to be greater than or equal to 1, but this value is not needed for the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Given the values from the initial state:
- `mak` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

So, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
