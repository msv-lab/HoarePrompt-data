Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and 1, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1` and is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The line `ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1` assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`.
- The values of other variables (`s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`) remain unchanged.
