Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given that `b` is defined as `min(n, m) + 1` and `min(n, m)` must be at least 2, `b` will be at least 3. Therefore, `ans` is now `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
