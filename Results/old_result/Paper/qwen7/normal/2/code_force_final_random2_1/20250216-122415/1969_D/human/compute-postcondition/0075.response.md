Postcondition: **`combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `removed_item` is the item pushed into the heap; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the first element of `removed_item`. If the `removed_item` is not empty, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`; otherwise, `current_profit` remains unchanged.**
