Output State: **`no` is a list containing `a`, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing either `a` (if `x` is 1) or `a` (if `x` is 2), `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `no` becomes a list containing the element `a`, while `num`, `big`, `less`, `iterable2`, `x`, and `a` retain their original values.
