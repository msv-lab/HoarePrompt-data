Output State: **`only_a` is updated to contain all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` contains all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`; `total_distinct` remains unchanged; `unique_a` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `m` remains unchanged; `k` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `unique_b` remains unchanged; `relevant_a` remains unchanged; `relevant_b` remains unchanged; `both` is the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.**

Explanation: The code `both = relevant_a & relevant_b` creates a new set `both` which contains only the elements that are present in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
