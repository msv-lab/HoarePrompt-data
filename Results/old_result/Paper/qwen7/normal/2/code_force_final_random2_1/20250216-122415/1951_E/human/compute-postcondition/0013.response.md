Output State: **`ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with an odd length; `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2; `a` is 2; `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value `2`, which was not present in the initial state. All other variables (`ch`, `b`, and the return value of `func_1(ch[:b])`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
