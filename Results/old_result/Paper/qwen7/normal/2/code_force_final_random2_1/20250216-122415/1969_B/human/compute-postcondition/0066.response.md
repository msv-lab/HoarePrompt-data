Output State: **`s` must not be empty; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the character `c` in the dictionary `cnt`. The precondition that `s` must not be empty is still valid, meaning `s` is not empty. The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, but the exact value before incrementation is not specified, so we only state that it is incremented.
