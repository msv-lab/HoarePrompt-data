Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `ans` is True**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `m` or `arr`. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state with `ans` being set to `True`.
