Based on the initial state and the conditions described:

- `L` is initially set to 50001.
- `R` is initially set to 50002.
- `numCuts` is 0.
- `x` is 50001, which is the midpoint of `L` and `R`.
- `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, but this value does not change within the loop.

The loop continues as long as `R - L > 1` and updates `L` and `R` based on the condition `if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x): L = x; else: R = x`.

Given that `numCuts` remains 0 throughout the loop, the condition `numCuts > k` is never met, and the condition `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)` also cannot be met because `numCuts` is always 0. Therefore, the only update to `L` and `R` occurs in the else part of the condition, setting `R = x`.

However, since `R` starts at 50002 and `x` is 50001, the loop will terminate when `R - L <= 1`. This means `L` will remain 50001 and `R` will be set to 50002 after the loop ends.

When the print statement `print(L)` is executed, it will print the value of `L`, which is 50001.

Output: **50001**
