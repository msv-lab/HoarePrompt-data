Output State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the modulus (`%`) of `num` (which is the first element of list `a`) with `x`. This value is stored in the variable `mod_x`. The values of `a` and `num` remain unchanged.
