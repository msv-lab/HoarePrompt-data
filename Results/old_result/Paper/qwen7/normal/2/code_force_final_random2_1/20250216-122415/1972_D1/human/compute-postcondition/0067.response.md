Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer value from `info[0]`.
   - `b` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `x` is \((a - 2) // 2 + 1\).
   - `suma` is \((a - 2) // 2 + (a - 2) // 2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i \times (i - 1) > 0\), then `suma` is updated to `suma + (a - i \times (i - 1))`.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `b + 1`.

4. **Update the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
   - `b` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the postconditions**:
   - Since `i` is now 4, we need to check if the condition \(a - i \times (i - 1) > 0\) holds true.
   - If the condition is true, `suma` will be updated accordingly.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `a` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `i` is now 4.
- `x` remains the same.
- `suma` remains the same unless the condition \(a - i \times (i - 1) > 0\) is true, in which case it will be updated.

Since we don't know the exact value of `a` or the specific update to `suma`, we will assume no update to `suma` for this step-by-step analysis.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 4, `x` is `(a - 2) // 2 + 1`, `suma` is `(a - 2) // 2 + (a - 2) // 2 + 1`**.
