Postcondition: **The `letters` list is sorted in ascending order, the `digits` list remains sorted in ascending order, `i` is 0, `len(digits)` is greater than 0, and either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`, and `digits[-1] is less than or equal to letters[i]`**
