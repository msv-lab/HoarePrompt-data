Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `i` is `m - 1`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `nums` by converting the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` into a list of integers and appending `arr[i]` to it. The conditions regarding `m` and `i` remain unchanged because no operations affect these variables. The value of `arr[i]` is still less than `arr[i - 1]`, but now `nums` contains both values as described.
