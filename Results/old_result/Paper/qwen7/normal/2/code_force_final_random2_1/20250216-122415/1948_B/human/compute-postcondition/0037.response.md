Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is at least 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `arr` is modified according to the conditions within the loop.
- `ans` is `False` if any of the conditions to update `arr[i - 1]` were met during the loop's execution; otherwise, `ans` remains `True`.

Given that `i` is initially 0, `arr[i - 1]` would refer to `arr[-1]`, which is out of bounds since `i` is 0 and the array is not yet fully initialized with elements corresponding to indices from 0 to `m-1`. Therefore, the condition to update `arr[i - 1]` cannot be met because `i - 1` is out of bounds.

Since no conditions to update `arr[i - 1]` are met, `ans` remains `True`.

Thus, the print statement will evaluate the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]`, which translates to `['NO', 'YES'][True]`, resulting in `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
