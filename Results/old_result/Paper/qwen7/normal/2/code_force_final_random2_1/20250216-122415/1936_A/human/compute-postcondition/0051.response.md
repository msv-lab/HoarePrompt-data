Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
- `s` is an input string but its content is not specified.
- `pans` is a list containing the element 1, so `pans` is `[1]`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

From the statement itself, it's clear that `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the provided initial state. Since these variables are not initialized or assigned any values, they will remain undefined and will result in a NameError if tried to be printed directly. Therefore, the `print` statement will fail to execute due to these undefined variables.

Given the format requirement, the output should reflect the intended print statement with placeholders for undefined variables.

Output: **'? ', mak, mak2, 2, mak2**
