Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `s` is a list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 29`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 30.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `x` remains an integer.
   - `s` remains a list.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` must be 2.
   - `x` is still an integer.
   - `s` is still a list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list**.
