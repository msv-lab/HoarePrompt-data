Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for h in range(0, n)`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `h`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `h`**: Since the loop starts from `0` and increments `h` by `1` each iteration, at the start of the first iteration, `h` is `0`.

3. **Understand the increment behavior**: The loop will continue as long as `h` is less than `n`.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: It is given that `li` has a new element which is `a + k * c + d * h`, and the other variables `a`, `k`, `c`, `d`, and `h` retain their original values.

5. **Determine the new value of `h`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `h` would have been incremented by `1` from its value at the start of the previous iteration. Therefore, if `h` was `0` at the start of the previous iteration, it would now be `1`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be less than `n`. If `h` is currently `1`, then `n` must be greater than `1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `li` has a new element which is `a + k * c + d * h`, the other variables `a`, `k`, `c`, `d`, and `h` retain their original values, `h` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.**
