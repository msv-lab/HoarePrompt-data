Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n - k`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `n - k` is a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was either 1 or 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 or 3.
   - `n - k` remains unchanged because it is determined by the initial values of `n` and `k` and does not change within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2 or 3 (depending on the previous value).
- `n - k` remains the same and is still a positive integer.
- `soma_b` and `pref` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values depend on the loop body, which is omitted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n - k` is a positive integer, `soma_b` is the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i`, and `pref` is updated if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` when `i` is 1.**
