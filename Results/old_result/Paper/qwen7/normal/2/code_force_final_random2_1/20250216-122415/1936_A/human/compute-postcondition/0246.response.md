Postcondition: `mak` is 1, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`. This is because the input string is compared to '>', and if they are equal, `mak` is set to 1, `i` is set to 2, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged as specified in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows from the if part.
