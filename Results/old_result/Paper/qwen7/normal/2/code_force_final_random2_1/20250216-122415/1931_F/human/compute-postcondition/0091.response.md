Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 4 (since the loop runs up to `n-1` and we've observed it running 3 times so far), `i` is 3, `m` is `m + 3` (since the loop runs 3 times), `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either 2, 1, or -1, `idx2` is either 2, 1, or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0.

If the conditions inside the loop were met (specifically, if `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` was true at any point), then `idx1` would be set to `i + 1` and `idx2` would be set to `i`. However, since we don't have information indicating that these conditions were met during the first three iterations, `idx1` and `idx2` will retain their last known values, which are either 2, 1, or -1.

After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2` inclusive, and `m` will be incremented by 3 for each iteration, resulting in `m + 3`. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` will remain as they were after the last iteration unless the specific conditions within the loop were met, in which case `idx1` and `idx2` would be updated accordingly.
