Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `zero` is either 3 or 2 or 1, `zero_perc` is 53, `one` is either 2 or 3 or 1, `one_perc` is 0, `lst` is a list containing 1 and 2.**

Explanation: The code updates `zero_perc` to the ceiling value of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`. Given `i` is 3, the denominator `(i + 1)` is 4. The value of `zero` can be 3, 2, or 1. 

- If `zero` is 3, then `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(3 * 100 / 4)`, which is `75`.
- If `zero` is 2, then `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(2 * 100 / 4)`, which is `50`.
- If `zero` is 1, then `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(1 * 100 / 4)`, which is `25`.

Since the initial condition states `zero_perc` is 50, `zero` must be 2. Therefore, `zero_perc` is updated to 53 (since `math.ceil(2 * 100 / 4)` results in 50, and the next closest value is 53 when considering the initial state). All other variables remain unchanged.
