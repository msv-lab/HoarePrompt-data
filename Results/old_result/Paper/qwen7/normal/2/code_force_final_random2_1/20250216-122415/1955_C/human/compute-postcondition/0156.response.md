Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range 1 to \(n\), `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the conditions (`l` is `r-2` or `r-1`, `r` is `n-3` or `n-2`), `sunks` is increased by 1 or 2, `k` is unchanged, and `a[r]` is modified based on the conditions (reduced by `a[l]` or `2 * a[l]`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the operations involving `k`, `a[r]`, and the adjustments to `l` and `r` do not occur. Therefore, `k` remains unchanged, and `a[r]` is modified based on the conditions specified before the `break` statement. All other variables retain their preconditions.
