Output State: `idx` is 1, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), and `i` is equal to the length of `nums`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each index in the `nums` list. If the condition `nums[i] > k` is met, the loop breaks and sets `idx` to `i - 1`. Given that the output state after the loop executes 3 times shows `idx` as 1, it means that the first two elements in `nums` (which are \(2^0\) and \(2^1\)) are less than or equal to `k`, but the third element (\(2^2\)) is greater than `k`. Therefore, the loop will continue until it reaches the end of the list, setting `i` to the length of `nums`, and `idx` will be set to the second-to-last index, which is 1.
