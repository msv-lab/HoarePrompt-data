Output State: **`u` is False, `c` is the first return value from function `r()`, `d` is the second return value from function `r()`**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `u` is `True`. The code `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Since `u` was initially `True`, which is equivalent to `1` in numerical context, decrementing it by 1 results in `0`, which is considered `False` in boolean context. The values of `c` and `d` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
