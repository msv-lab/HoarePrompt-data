Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`.
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, no changes occur. Otherwise, `b` is a sorted string of `s`, and `c` is a string consisting of the characters of `s` sorted in descending order.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` must be greater than 0, the loop will execute as long as `i` remains less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

5. **Updated state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged (still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `s` remains unchanged (still an input string).
   - `a` remains unchanged (still a set containing unique characters from `s`).

Given this reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`**.
