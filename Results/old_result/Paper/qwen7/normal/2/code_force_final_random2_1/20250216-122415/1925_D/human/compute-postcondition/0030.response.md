Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f` plus `f`, `j` is `m`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the third integer from the input**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and splits them into `a`, `b`, and `f`. The initial conditions for `m` and `sum_f` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are set to the respective integers from the input.
