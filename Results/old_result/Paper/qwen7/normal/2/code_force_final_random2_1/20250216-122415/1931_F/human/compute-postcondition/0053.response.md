Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 1 or -1, `idx2` is 1 or -1, `p1` is 1 or 0, `p2` is 1 or 0, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. All the initial conditions remain unchanged.
