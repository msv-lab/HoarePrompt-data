The only variable in the loop head is the variable `s`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s.find('pie') != -1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` does not contain the substring 'pie' at least once. For the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must contain the substring 'pie'.

State: **`ans` is 4, `s` must contain the substring 'pie'**
