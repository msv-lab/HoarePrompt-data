Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with a length of at least 2, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 1, the current value of `s[j]` is '1', and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1'. If the first two characters of `s` are '01', then `flag` is set to True and `j` is incremented to 1.
