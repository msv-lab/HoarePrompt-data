Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`; `v` is `y - x`; `a` is `-1000000000.0`; `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v, b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v), b[-1] + v + (v > z - y) * (b[-1] + v), b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-1] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v))]; `c` is `2000000000.0`; `d` is `-1000000000.0`; `u` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- `a` is assigned the value `-1000000000.0`.
- The first return value of `r()` is assigned to `c`, which is `2000000000.0`.
- The second return value of `r()` is assigned to `d`, which is `-1000000000.0`.
- The values of `t`, `v`, `b`, and `u` remain unchanged from their initial states.
