Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n - k` is a positive integer, `soma_b` is the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i + 1`, and `pref` is updated if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` when `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increments `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `soma_b` now includes the element at index `i + 1` in `lista_B`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
