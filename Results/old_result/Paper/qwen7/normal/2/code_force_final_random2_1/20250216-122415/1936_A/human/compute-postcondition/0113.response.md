Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is the length of `pans` plus the number of iterations.
   - `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `s` is the input string `'>'`.
   - `pans` is an empty list.
   - The length of `pans` plus the number of iterations must be less than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

Given the initial state:
- Since `pans` is an empty list, its length is 0.
- Let's assume the number of iterations is `k`. Therefore, `i` is `0 + k = k`.
- `mak` is set to `i`, so `mak` is also `k`.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so `mak2` is also `k`.

Thus, the print statement will output:
```python
print('?', k, k, k, k)
```

Output: **? k k k k**
