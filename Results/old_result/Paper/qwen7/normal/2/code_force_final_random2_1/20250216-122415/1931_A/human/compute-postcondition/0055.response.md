Output State: **`arr` is [], `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, `info` contains [[lex, 26]], `i` is 1**

The code `lex = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `lex`. The other variables (`arr`, `j`, `info`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
