Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 3, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input by space.**

The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input string, splits it by spaces, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `c` and `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged.
