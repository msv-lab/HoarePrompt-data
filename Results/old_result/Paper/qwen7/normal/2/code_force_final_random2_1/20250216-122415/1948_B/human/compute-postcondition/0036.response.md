Output State: **Postcondition: `m` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is modified according to the conditions within the loop, and `ans` is `False` if any of the conditions to update `arr[i - 1]` were met during the loop's execution; otherwise, `ans` remains `True`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be 0 because the loop starts from `m-1` and decrements `i` until it reaches 0. The variable `ans` will be `False` if at any point the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` was true and the corresponding update to `arr[i - 1]` was made. If no such condition was met throughout the loop, `ans` will remain `True`. The list `arr` will be modified based on the logic inside the loop where elements are rearranged as described.
