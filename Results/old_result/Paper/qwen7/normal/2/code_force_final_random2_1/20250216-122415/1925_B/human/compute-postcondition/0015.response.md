Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `isqrt(x) + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments until it reaches `isqrt(x) + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `i` is a divisor of `x`.
   - `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i`.
   - If `n` is greater than `x // i`, then `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `isqrt(x) + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i + 1` must be within the range of the loop.

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` to `i + 1`.
   - `n` must remain the same as it does not change within the loop unless explicitly modified (which is not mentioned here).

7. **Post-Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - `ans` will be updated if `i + 1` is a divisor of `x` and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i + 1`.
   - If `n` is greater than `x // (i + 1)`, then `ans` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x` and `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i`, and `n` must be greater than `x // (i + 1)` if `i + 1` is a divisor of `x`.**
