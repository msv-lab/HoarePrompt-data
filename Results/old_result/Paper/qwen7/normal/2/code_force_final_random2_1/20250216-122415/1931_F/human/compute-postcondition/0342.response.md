Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(m - 2):` statement. This means the loop will run `m - 2` times.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as `m` must be at least 3, and an input is taken but not stored.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs `m - 2` times. For the loop to continue, `m` must be at least 3 (since `m - 2` must be a positive integer).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to start, for the loop to continue, `m` must still be at least 3.
   - An input is taken but not stored, so this state remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 4 (since `m - 2` should be at least 1 for another iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` must be at least 4**.
