Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`, which is initialized in the `range` function. The `range` function takes `len(costs) - (k - 1)` as its argument.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop will start with `i` being 0 and increment until `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be true. This means that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts from 0).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `total_costs` is an empty list and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers. This does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `costs` is a list of `n` elements, each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`. We need to ensure that `len(costs)` is at least `k`.

Given these points, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `len(costs)` is at least `k` so that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, `costs` is a list of `n` elements, and the length of `costs` must be at least `k`**.
