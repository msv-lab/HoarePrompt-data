The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it finds the highest value \( b \) in the list where the current element is greater than the previous one, and the second highest value \( a \) among the initial value of \( a \), or any value greater than both \( a \) and \( b \). It then counts how many elements in the list are greater than both \( a \) and \( b \). The function outputs this count for each test case.
