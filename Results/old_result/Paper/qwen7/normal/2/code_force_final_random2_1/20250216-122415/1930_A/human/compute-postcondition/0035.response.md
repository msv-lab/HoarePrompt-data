Output State: **`suma` is 4, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings starting with the second smallest number except the first element, `a` is the first element of the updated `numbers` list converted to an integer, `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list converted to an integer, and the first element of `numbers` is popped and assigned to `a`.**

The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the `numbers` list and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
