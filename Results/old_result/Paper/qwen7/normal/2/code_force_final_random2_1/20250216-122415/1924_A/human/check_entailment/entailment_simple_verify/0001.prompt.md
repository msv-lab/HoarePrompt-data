You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.

    #State: `s1` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself, `s2` is the string formed by concatenating every unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet` (each character repeated once), and `alphabet` is an empty set.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` and going to the end, and the string `s2` which contains each unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to identify if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - It constructs two strings: `s1` and `s2`.
     - `s1` is built by including characters from `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - `s2` is built by taking every `k`th character from `s1` after removing duplicate characters.
   - It checks if `s1` has at least `n * k` characters. If so, it returns `True` and the appropriate substrings; otherwise, it returns `False` and the substrings.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic checks the output of `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "No" and generates a string of length `n` using characters not present in `s1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "Yes".

### Issues Identified:
1. **Character Generation for Missing Subsequence:**
   - The code tries to generate a missing subsequence by finding the first character `i` that is not in `s1` and creating a string of length `n` using this character.
   - However, this approach might not always work because it only considers one character at a time, and it doesn't ensure that the generated string is lexicographically minimal or maximal, which is required by the problem statement.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` does not handle edge cases well, such as when `s` is very short or when `k` is large compared to `n`.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the provided examples to see if the program works correctly:

#### Example 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  2 2 4
  abba
  2 2 3
  abb
  3 3 10
  aabbccabab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  NO
  aa
  NO
  ccc
  ```

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `s = 'abba'`
  - `func_1` will correctly identify that all possible strings of length 2 using 'a' and 'b' are subsequences of 'abba'.
  - Output: `YES`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `s = 'abb'`
  - `func_1` will identify that 'aa' is not a subsequence of 'abb'.
  - Output: `NO` and `'aa'`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `s = 'aabbccabab'`
  - `func_1` will identify that 'ccc' is not a subsequence of 'aabbccabab'.
  - Output: `NO` and `'ccc'`

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the examples correctly but has issues with generating the correct missing subsequence. The current implementation might not always produce the lexicographically smallest or largest missing subsequence as required by the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
