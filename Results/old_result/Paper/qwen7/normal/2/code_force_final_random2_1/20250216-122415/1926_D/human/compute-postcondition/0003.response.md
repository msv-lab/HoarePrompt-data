Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which is not specified but implied to be their default or previously defined state. Since no other variables are mentioned or altered, the only change is that `n` now holds the value of the user's input as an integer.
