Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`: This function reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list. It correctly handles the input for each test case.
   - `func_2()`: This function reads a single integer and returns it. However, this function is not used in the main logic of `func_5()`, so it seems redundant.
   - `func_3()`: This function reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a map object. It correctly handles the input for each test case, including `n` and `x` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - `func_4()`: This function reads the first line of input and returns it after stripping any trailing whitespace. It is not used in the main logic of `func_5()`, so it seems redundant.
   - `func_5()`: This function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of segments `[l_i, r_i]` such that the bitwise OR of their XOR results is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_5()` correctly iterates over the bits of `x` from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.
   - It checks the conditions for each bit position and updates the counter `ans` accordingly.
   - The function handles edge cases and ensures that the maximum number of segments is found.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where `x` has all bits set to 0.
   - It correctly handles cases where no valid segments can be formed.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem statement. All necessary steps are included, and the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
