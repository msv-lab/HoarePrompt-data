Output State: **`results` is a list containing 'NO', `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a` and its length is greater than `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, and its length is greater than `k // 2`.
