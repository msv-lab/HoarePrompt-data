Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, the first element of `b` is not equal to the second element of `b`, `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order starting from index `n` of list `a`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to the original value of `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`. The element at index `n-2` in list `b` is equal to the element at index `n-1` in list `b`.
