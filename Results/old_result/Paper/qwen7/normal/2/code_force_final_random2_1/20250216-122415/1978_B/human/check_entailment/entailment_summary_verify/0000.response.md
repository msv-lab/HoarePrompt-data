### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step using the given function summaries and the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k` value.
   - The formula used is: \( \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).
   - Here, \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \) represents the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns.
   - \( (n - k) \times a \) represents the sum of the usual prices for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.
   - The formula is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` value that maximizes the profit.
   - The function initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - It performs a binary search to find the best `k` value.
   - For each midpoint `mid`, it calculates the profit using `func_1(mid)` and `func_1(mid + 1)`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The function returns the maximum profit found during the binary search.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search approach is correct because it efficiently narrows down the range of possible `k` values to find the optimal one.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that the optimal `k` value is found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \) (all buns are sold at the usual price) correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where \( k = \min(n, b) \) (all buns are sold at the modified price).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` value is found efficiently, and `func_1` accurately computes the profit for any valid `k`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the required logic and handles all potential cases as described.
