Postcondition: **`fnd` is adjusted according to the condition, `pairs_in_D` is adjusted accordingly, `C[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` may be updated according to the condition, `in_aa` will be the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` will be the corresponding element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1. If `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**
