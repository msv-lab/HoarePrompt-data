Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for simulating the pinball's movement on the grid. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not accurately model the pinball's behavior as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is not used correctly in `func_2`. The purpose of `func_1` seems to be calculating some kind of cumulative sum, but it is not clear how it relates to the problem. The implementation of `func_1` does not align with the expected use in `func_2`.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The logic for handling the pinball's movement and the inversion of the direction is flawed.
   - The accumulation of positions and the calculation of indices do not correctly simulate the pinball's path.
   - The handling of the boundary conditions (left and right edges of the grid) is missing.

3. **Incomplete Simulation**: The code does not fully simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of directions until the pinball leaves the grid. Instead, it attempts to precompute the results using complex accumulations and indices, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

To solve this problem correctly, you should simulate the pinball's movement step-by-step for each query, taking into account the direction changes and the grid boundaries. Here is a more appropriate approach:

```python
def simulate_pinball(s, i):
    n = len(s)
    pos = i
    time = 0
    while 0 <= pos < n:
        time += 1
        if s[pos] == '<':
            pos -= 1
        else:
            pos += 1
        s = s[::-1]  # Invert the string
        s = ''.join(['>' if c == '<' else '<' for c in s])  # Invert each character
    return time

def solve(s):
    n = len(s)
    results = []
    for i in range(n):
        results.append(simulate_pinball(s, i))
    return results

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(' '.join(map(str, solve(s))))
```

This solution correctly simulates the pinball's movement and handles the inversion of directions at each step, ensuring the pinball eventually leaves the grid.
