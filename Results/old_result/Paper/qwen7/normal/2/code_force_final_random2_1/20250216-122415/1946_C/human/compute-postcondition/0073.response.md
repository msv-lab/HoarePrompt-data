Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`**

The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` calls the function `dfs` with arguments `1` and `1`, and assigns the return value of this function call to the variable `leftover`. Since the actual implementation of the `dfs` function is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `leftover`. However, we know that `leftover` now holds the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
