Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' based on certain conditions, but this variable is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
```

This statement will print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by a space. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9, their specific values cannot be determined without additional information. However, we know they will be printed in that order with a space separating them.

Output: **x y z (where x, y, and z are random integers between 1 and 9)**
