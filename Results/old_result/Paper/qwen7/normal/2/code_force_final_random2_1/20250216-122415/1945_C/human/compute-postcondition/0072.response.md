Output State: **`final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `final` will contain every element from the list `lst` that meets the condition where the absolute difference between `pk` and each element `elem` is equal to `mini`. The values of all other variables (`mini`, `zero`, `one`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `lst`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
