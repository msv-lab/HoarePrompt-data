Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 75001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code snippet `R = x` assigns the value of `x` (which is 75001) to the variable `R`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
