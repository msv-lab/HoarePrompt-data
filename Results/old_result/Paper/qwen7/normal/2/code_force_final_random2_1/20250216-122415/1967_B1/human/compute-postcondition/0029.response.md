Output State: **`n` is an integer converted from the first string input, `m` is an integer converted from the second string input**.

Explanation: The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the string inputs `n` and `m` into integers and assigns them back to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state where `n` and `m` were strings is now updated to reflect their conversion to integers. All other information from the initial state remains unchanged.
