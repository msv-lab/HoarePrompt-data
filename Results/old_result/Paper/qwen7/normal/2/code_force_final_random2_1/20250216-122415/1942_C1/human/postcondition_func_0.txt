The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \(T\), \(n\), \(x\), and \(y\). For each test case, it reads a list of \(x\) distinct integers from 1 to \(n\), sorts the list, and calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list. It also considers the gap between the largest element in the list and \(n\). The function then prints the total count of these gaps plus \(x - 2\). After processing all test cases, it outputs the result for each case.
