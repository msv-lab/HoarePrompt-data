Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `new` is a list starting from `a[0]` to the end of the list `a`
   - `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`
   - `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`
   - If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `check_all_new` is false or `new_all` is false, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, and `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` changes to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The values of `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[0]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`**.
