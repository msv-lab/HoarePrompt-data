Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings sorted in ascending order with its first element removed, `b` is the first element of the original list converted to an integer, `suma` is `min(a, b)` and `a` is the first element of the original list converted to an integer minus the first element.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `b`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The other variables (`numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `numbers`, and `suma`) remain in their previous states.
