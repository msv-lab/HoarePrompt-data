Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ans = []` initializes an empty list for the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
