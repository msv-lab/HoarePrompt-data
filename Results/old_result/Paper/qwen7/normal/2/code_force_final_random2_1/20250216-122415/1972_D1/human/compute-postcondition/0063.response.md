Output State: **`a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `x` is `(a - 2) // 2 + 1`, and `suma` is `(a - 2) // 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 ** 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `(a - 6) // 9 + 1`. Since `x` was previously defined as `(a - 2) // 2`, the new value of `x` is updated to `(a - 6) // 9 + 1`. The value of `suma` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `x`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unaffected.
