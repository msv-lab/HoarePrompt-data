Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`. Additionally, either `idx1` is 1 and `idx2` is -1, or `idx1` is -1 and `idx2` is 1, and `p1` and `p2` are adjusted accordingly such that either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`.
