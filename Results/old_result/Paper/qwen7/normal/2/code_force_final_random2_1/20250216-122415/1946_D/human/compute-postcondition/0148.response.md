Output State: **`ai` is `ai ^ val`, `i` is 2, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is False, `a` must contain at least one element, `t` contains `ai ^ val`.**

The code `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Since `ai` is `ai ^ val` in the initial state, `t` now contains `ai ^ val`. All other variables remain unchanged.
