Output State: **`i` is 3, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), `w` must be greater than 3, and `M` is a list containing the values 2, 3, and `q // i`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. Since `i` is 3, `M` originally contains the values 2 and 3. After executing the code, `M` will contain the values 2, 3, and `q // i`. The values of `i`, `q`, `x`, `w`, and the original content of `M` remain unchanged.
