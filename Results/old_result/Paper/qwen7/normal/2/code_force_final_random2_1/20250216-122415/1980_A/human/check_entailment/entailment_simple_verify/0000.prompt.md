You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5; a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, i will be 'F', p is 'ABCDEF', ans will be 0, hmp will be a dictionary with keys 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' each mapped to the total count of these characters in the input string s across all iterations, n will be the input integer from the first iteration, m will be the input integer from the first iteration, and s will be the input string from the last iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
7 2
ABCDEFAB
```
- Expected Output:
```
4
```
- Program Output:
```
2
```

The program fails to recognize that for 2 rounds, Vlad needs at least 2 problems of difficulty 'A', 2 problems of difficulty 'B', 2 problems of difficulty 'C', and 2 problems of difficulty 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G' each at least once. However, the program only counts the shortfall of each required difficulty level without ensuring that each difficulty level is met for every round.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', the total number of problems available plus the number of problems to be created is at least `m`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
