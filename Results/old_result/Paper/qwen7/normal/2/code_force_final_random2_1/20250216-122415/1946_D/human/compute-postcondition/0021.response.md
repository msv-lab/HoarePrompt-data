Output State: **`op` is False, `ai` is `ai ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and `t` is a list containing the value of `ai`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `ai` to the list `t`. The variables `op` and `ai` undergo an XOR operation with `val >> i & 1`, but the value of `ai` after this operation is not directly used in the append operation. Therefore, `ai` remains as the result of the XOR operation, and `t` now contains this updated value of `ai`. The value of `op` remains unchanged.
