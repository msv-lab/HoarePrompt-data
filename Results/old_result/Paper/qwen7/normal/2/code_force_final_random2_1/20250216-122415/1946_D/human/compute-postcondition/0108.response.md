Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is 0, and `v` is odd.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used within a loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The `v` is noted to be odd, which means its value is an odd number, and this state is preserved.
