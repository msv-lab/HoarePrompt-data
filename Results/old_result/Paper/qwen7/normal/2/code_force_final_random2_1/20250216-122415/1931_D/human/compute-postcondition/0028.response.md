Output State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) is present in the set `freq` with a value of 1.**

Explanation: The code `required_mod_y = mod_y` simply assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
