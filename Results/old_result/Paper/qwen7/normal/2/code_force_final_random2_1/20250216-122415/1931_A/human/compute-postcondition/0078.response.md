Output State: **`j` is either 0 or 1; `lex` is between 2 and 52 (inclusive); `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the element 26, and now the list also contains an additional element 26.**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 26. Given that `lex` was initially between 27 and 78 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from it results in a new range for `lex` from 2 to 52 (inclusive). The values of `j` and the list `arr` remain unchanged.
