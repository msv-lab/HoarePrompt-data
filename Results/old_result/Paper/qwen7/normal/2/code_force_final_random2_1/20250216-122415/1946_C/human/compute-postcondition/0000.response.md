Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is 1, `R` is 100001.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(sys.stdin.readline())` reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `x` and `R` remain unchanged. The initial constraints for `t` are preserved, and `x` and `R` retain their initial values.
