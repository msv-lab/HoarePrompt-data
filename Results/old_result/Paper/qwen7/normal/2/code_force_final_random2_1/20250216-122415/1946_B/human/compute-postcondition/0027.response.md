Output State: **`t` is the maximum value that `tmp` ever reached during the loop execution, and `tmp` is 0.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will hold the maximum value that `tmp` ever reached during the loop's execution. This is because the loop updates `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and `t` on each iteration. The variable `tmp` is reset to 0 whenever it becomes less than 0 or at the end of each iteration, so its final value will always be 0.
