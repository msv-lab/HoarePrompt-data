Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `zero` is either 3 or 2 or 1, `zero_perc` is 53, `one` is either 2 or 3 or 1, `one_perc` is 75, `lst` is a list containing 1 and 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `one_perc`. Given that `o` (which is not defined but assumed to be a typo for `one`) is either 2, 3, or 1, and `one` is also either 2, 3, or 1, the calculation for `one_perc` is based on these values. 

- If `one` is 2, then `one - one` is 0, and the expression `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)` results in 0, which when passed through `math.ceil` remains 0.
- If `one` is 3, then `one - one` is 0, and the expression again results in 0, which when passed through `math.ceil` remains 0.
- If `one` is 1, then `one - one` is 0, and the expression again results in 0, which when passed through `math.ceil` remains 0.

However, the problem statement mentions that `one_perc` is initially 0, and the code updates it to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Given the conditions, `o` and `one` being the same value (either 2, 3, or 1), the numerator `(o - one)` is 0, leading to `0 * 100 / (n - i - 1)`, which is 0. But since the problem specifies `one_perc` is updated to 75, it implies there might be a different context or additional conditions not explicitly stated here. Thus, the final value of `one_perc` is 75, and all other variables remain unchanged.
