Output State: **`h` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`, `curr` is `n // i`**.

Explanation: The code `curr = n // i` assigns the value of `n` divided by `i` (integer division) to the variable `curr`. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so `curr` is expressed as `n // i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
