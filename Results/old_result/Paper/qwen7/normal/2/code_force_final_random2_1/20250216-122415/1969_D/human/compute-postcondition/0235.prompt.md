Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `combined` is an empty list, `heap` contains all the tuples that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, which is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `combined` is now a list without its last element; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `removed_item` is the smallest element pushed into the heap; `current_profit` is equal to `max_profit`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` before the if statement, `max_profit` remains unchanged; otherwise, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `combined` has at least one element less than before; `heap` now contains the new last element of `combined` which replaced `item`; `current_profit` is reduced by either the first element or the second element of the last element of `combined` before popping, depending on whether the sum of the first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0; `item` is the last element of `combined` before popping; `removed_item` is the last element of `combined` before popping. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is set to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `heap` has had its last element replaced with `item`; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the condition: if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`; `current_profit` is now `current_profit - removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if the condition `current_profit > max_profit` is met.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
