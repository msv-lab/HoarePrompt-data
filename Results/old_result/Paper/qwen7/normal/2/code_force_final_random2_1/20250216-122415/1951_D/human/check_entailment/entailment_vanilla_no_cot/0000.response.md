Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Stalls**: The solution only considers up to 2 stalls, which is insufficient to handle the requirement of setting up at most 60 stalls and ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The function `func_1` does not properly distribute the number of stalls or their respective prices.
   - The logic for determining the number of stalls and their prices is flawed. It does not account for the greedy nature of Alice's purchasing behavior across multiple stalls.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The solution fails to handle various edge cases, such as when `n` is significantly larger than `k`, or when `n` is just slightly larger than `k`.

### Correct Solution Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by strategically setting the prices of the stalls. Here’s a more appropriate approach:

1. **Distribute Coins Across Stalls**: We can distribute the coins across multiple stalls in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
2. **Greedy Algorithm**: Use a greedy algorithm to determine the number of stalls and their respective prices.

Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import sys

def solve(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print("YES")
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    # Determine the number of stalls needed
    stalls = []
    current_stall_price = 1
    while n > 0 and len(stalls) < 60:
        if n >= current_stall_price:
            stalls.append(current_stall_price)
            n -= current_stall_price
        else:
            stalls.append(n)
            n = 0
        current_stall_price += 1
    
    if sum(stalls) >= k:
        print("YES")
        print(len(stalls))
        print(" ".join(map(str, stalls)))
    else:
        print("NO")

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    solve(n, k)
```

This solution ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by distributing the coins across up to 60 stalls, each with a progressively higher price.
