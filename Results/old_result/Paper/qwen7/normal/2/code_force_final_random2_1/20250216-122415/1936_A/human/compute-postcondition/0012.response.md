Output State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the input received is less than 0**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `mak`, `i`, `n`, and the input condition remain unchanged.
