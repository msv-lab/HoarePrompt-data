Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `i` to `n-1`. The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `max_index`, `min_indices[0]`, `max_index`, and `i`. Since `i` is now `n-1`, the function call is stored in `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
