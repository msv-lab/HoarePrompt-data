Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted; `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted; `adj[b]` now contains `a`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains the value of `b`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will contain both `b` and `a`. However, since the initial state only specifies that `adj[b]` contains `b`, the updated state is that `adj[b]` now contains `a` in addition to `b`.
