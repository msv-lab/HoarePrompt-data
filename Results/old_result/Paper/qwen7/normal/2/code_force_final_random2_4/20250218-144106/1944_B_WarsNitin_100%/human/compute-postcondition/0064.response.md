Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` equals 0, `ans1` contains the elements `b[3]` and `b[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans1` now contains the element `b[3]` twice. The other variables remain unchanged.
