Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be exactly equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. The postcondition will depend on the specific inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. If the string `s` contains '11' at any point, the postcondition will be that the output printed was 'NO'. Otherwise, if `cnt1` is greater than 2 and `cnt1` is even, the postcondition will be that the output printed was 'YES'. For all other cases where `cnt1` is either greater than 2 and odd, or `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2, the postcondition will be that the output printed was 'NO'.
