Output: **n - k + 1, 1**

Explanation:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), but it is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- It is given that `n > k`.
- Additionally, it is stated that `k - 1 < n - k + 1`.

The print statement `print(n - k + 1, 1)` will output two values separated by a comma:
1. The value of `n - k + 1`.
2. The integer `1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we express the first value in terms of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the output is `n - k + 1, 1`.
