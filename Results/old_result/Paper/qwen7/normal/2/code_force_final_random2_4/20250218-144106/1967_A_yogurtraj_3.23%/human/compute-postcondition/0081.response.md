Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`. The values of `i` and `k` are updated according to the given conditions. The initial state of `i` being incremented by 1 and `k` being decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` remains valid after the code execution.
