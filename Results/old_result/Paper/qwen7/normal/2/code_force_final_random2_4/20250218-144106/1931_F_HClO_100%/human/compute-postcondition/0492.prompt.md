Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m == 1:
        input()
        print('yes')
        continue
    a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())
    a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())
    l11 = [i for i in l1 if i != a2]
    l22 = [i for i in l2 if i != a1]
    if l11 != l22:
        for _ in range(m - 2):
            input()
        print('no')
        continue
    idx1 = idx2 = -1
    p1 = p2 = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
            break
        if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
                idx1 = idx2 = i
                break
            else:
                if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                    idx1 = i
                    p1 = 1
                else:
                    idx2 = i
                    p2 = 1
                if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                    break
    val = []
    if idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1:
        idx1 = n - 2
    if idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1:
        idx2 = n - 2
    if idx1 < idx2:
        l2.insert(idx1, a2)
        l = l2
    elif idx1 > idx2:
        l1.insert(idx2, a1)
        l = l1
    else:
        if m == 2:
            print('yes')
            continue
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        if l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2):
            l1.insert(idx2, a1)
            l = l1
        else:
            l2.insert(idx1, a2)
            l = l2
        val.append((a3, l3))
        m -= 1
    for _ in range(m - 2):
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        val.append((a3, l3))
    for a3, l3 in val:
        if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
            print('no')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The list `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers. After executing all iterations of the loop, the loop has checked each tuple in `val` to ensure that `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` except those equal to `a3`. If for any tuple `(a3, l3)`, the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` is false, the loop breaks and prints 'no'. If the condition holds true for all tuples in `val`, the loop completes and prints 'yes'.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, if none of the lists `l3` in the tuples of `val` match the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]` for their respective `a3`, the final output will be 'yes'. Otherwise, if any list `l3` matches the list comprehension, the output will be 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: m is 2 or less, a3 is a list of integers representing the values entered during each iteration of the loop, l3 is a list of lists of integers also entered during each iteration, val is a list containing m-2 tuples (a3, l3) from each iteration, and _ is m-2, indicating the number of iterations performed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `m` will be greater than 2, `a3` will hold the first integer from each of the `m-2` inputs provided, `l3` will be a list of the remaining integers from each of these inputs, all converted to integers, and `val` will be a list containing `m-2` tuples, with each tuple consisting of an `a3` and corresponding `l3`.

In more detail, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `m` will retain its value indicating that the loop ran `m-2` times.
- `a3` will store the first integer from each of the `m-2` inputs.
- `l3` will contain the remaining integers from each of these inputs, excluding the first integer, all converted to integers.
- `val` will be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding `a3` and `l3` for each of the `m-2` inputs.

If at any point during the loop's execution, the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` evaluates to `False` for any iteration, the loop will break and print 'no' instead of continuing to the next iteration or completing the final 'else' block which would print 'yes'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
