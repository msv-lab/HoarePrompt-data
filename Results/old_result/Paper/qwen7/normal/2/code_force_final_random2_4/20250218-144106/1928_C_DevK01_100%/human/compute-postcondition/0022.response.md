Output State: **`i` must be less than `w` and `i` must be greater than 2; `M` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Since `i` must be less than `w` and greater than 2, the value of `i` is added to the list `M`. The conditions on `i` remain unchanged, and `M` is now a list containing the value of `i`.
