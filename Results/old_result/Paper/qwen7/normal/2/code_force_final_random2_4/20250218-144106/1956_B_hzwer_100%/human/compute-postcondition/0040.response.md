Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in `cnt`. For each iteration, `x` takes the value of an element from `cnt`.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute. This means `cnt` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `cnt`.

4. **Consider the initial state**: Initially, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` contains the frequency of each number that appeared in `a`, and `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt` after decrementing each element (except the first one) by one.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**: Since the loop depends on `cnt` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `cnt` is not empty. The other variables (`a` and `ans`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they provide context about the initial state.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` must contain at least one element**
