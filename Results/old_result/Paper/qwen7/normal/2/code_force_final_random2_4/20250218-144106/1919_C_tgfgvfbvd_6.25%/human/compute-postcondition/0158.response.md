Postcondition: `y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, and `a` remains unchanged. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then either `a` remains unchanged if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, or `b` remains unchanged if `a - l[x]` is greater than `b - l[x]`. If the condition `l[x] < a` is true but `l[x] >= b`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `l[x] >= a` and `l[x] < b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`.
