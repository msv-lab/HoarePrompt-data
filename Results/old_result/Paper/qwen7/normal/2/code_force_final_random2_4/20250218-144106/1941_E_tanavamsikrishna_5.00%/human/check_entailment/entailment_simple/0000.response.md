### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function processes a single row of river depths (`row`) and a maximum distance (`d`) between supports.
   - It first increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by their respective indices.
   - Then, it updates each subsequent element of `row` to be the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus 1.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the updated `row`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes the entire grid of river depths.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row and stores the result in a list called `costs`.
   - It then calculates the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges across consecutive rows by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows and storing these sums in `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_2`, and prints the results.
   - The logic in `func_2` ensures that the cost calculations are performed correctly for each row and the minimum total cost is found.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, and the logic adheres to the problem statement.
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the first and last columns have a depth of 0.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Each part of the program is designed to handle the specific requirements stated in the problem description.
