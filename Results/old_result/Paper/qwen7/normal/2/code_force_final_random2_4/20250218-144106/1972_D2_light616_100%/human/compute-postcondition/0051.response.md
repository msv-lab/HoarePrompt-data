Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 2, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 2**.

Explanation: The code updates `cnt` by adding the minimum value between `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to `cnt`. Given the initial values, `x + y` equals 5. Therefore, `n // ((x + y) * x)` is `n // (5 * 3) = n // 15`, and `m // ((x + y) * y)` is `m // (5 * 2) = m // 10`. Since `n` is at least 10 and `m` is at least 20, the minimum value between these two expressions is 1 (when `n` is 10 and `m` is 20). Thus, `cnt` is updated from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
