Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` is an input integer, `v` is appended to the list `tree`.**

The code `tree.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `tree`. Since `v` is an input integer, its specific value is not known, but it is added to the list. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `u`) remain unchanged.
