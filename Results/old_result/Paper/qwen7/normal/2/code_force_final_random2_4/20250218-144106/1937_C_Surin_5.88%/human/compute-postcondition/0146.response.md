Output State: **i is n, n is an input integer, r is an input string, g is 0, v1 is n - 1, v2 is n - 1, and prev remains unchanged (still 0).**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i` starting at 1 up to but not including `n`. After `n-1` iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. During each iteration, `v1` and `v2` are updated to the current value of `i`, which is `n-1` by the last iteration. The values of `n`, `r`, `g`, and `prev` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
