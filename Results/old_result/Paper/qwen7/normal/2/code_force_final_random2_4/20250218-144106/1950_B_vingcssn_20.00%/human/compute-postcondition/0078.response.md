Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is `c + 1`, but since `c` is not explicitly defined, we can assume it is being incremented by 1.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an integer input.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'##..##'`.

Since none of the variables `c`, `t`, or `n` are used in the print statement, and the only content being printed is the string `'##..##'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **##..##**
