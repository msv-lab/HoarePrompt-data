Postcondition: `a` is an array, `mod_x` is num % x, `mod_y` is num % y, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `required_mod_y` is num % y. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is not found in `freq`, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.
