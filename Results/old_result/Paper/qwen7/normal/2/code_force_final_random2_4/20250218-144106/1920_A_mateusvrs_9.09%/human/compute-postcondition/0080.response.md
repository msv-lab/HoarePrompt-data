Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `x` respectively. The initial conditions for `n` and the possible values for `a` and `x` are updated accordingly. `n` remains greater than 1, `a` becomes an integer from input (previously it was either 1 or an integer from input but not equal to 1, now it is specifically an integer from input), and `x` becomes an integer from input.
