Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is increased by `s * (l[2] + t)`, `t` is increased by `s`**

Explanation: The code `t += s` increments the value of `t` by the value of `s`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `n` must still be greater than 0, `s` is still the minimum value between `m` and `k`, and `c` is increased by `s * (l[2] + t)`. Additionally, `t` is increased by `s`.
