### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling \( n \) buns.
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price of \( b - i + 1 \) coins for the \( i \)-th bun.
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \) coins each.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It calculates \( k \) as the minimum of \( n \) and \( b - a \).
   - If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \) (since no bun should be sold at a lower price).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula \( b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).

3. **Checking the Formula:**
   - The term \( b \times k \) represents the total revenue from the first \( k \) buns.
   - The term \( -\frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \) accounts for the decreasing price of each subsequent bun.
   - The term \( (n - k) \times a \) represents the total revenue from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \( b \leq a \), the formula simplifies to \( a \times n \), which is correct.
   - When \( b > a \), the formula correctly accounts for the decreasing price and the usual price.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic in the code matches the problem statement and the examples provided.
   - The formula used to calculate the profit is correct and handles all edge cases appropriately.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
   - The function iterates over each test case, calculates \( k \) correctly, and applies the appropriate formula based on the condition \( b \leq a \).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given conditions. The code handles all edge cases and the formula used is correct.
