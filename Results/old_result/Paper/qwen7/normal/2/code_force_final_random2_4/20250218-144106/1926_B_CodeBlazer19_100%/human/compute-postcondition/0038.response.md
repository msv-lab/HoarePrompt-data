Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to the value of `n`.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or remains 0.
- `b` is 'SQUARE'.
- `s` is the final input string after all iterations, but this variable is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is `print(b)`, and since `b` is explicitly stated to be 'SQUARE', the output will be:

Output: **'SQUARE'**
