Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads a string `a` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'.
3. It initializes two counters, `l` for counting 'A' and `h` for counting 'B'.
4. It iterates through each character in the string `a`, updating the counters accordingly.
5. After counting, it compares the counters `l` and `h` to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently and prints the result.
6. The logic to determine the most frequent character is correct.
7. The program does not have any logical errors or issues with the given constraints.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
