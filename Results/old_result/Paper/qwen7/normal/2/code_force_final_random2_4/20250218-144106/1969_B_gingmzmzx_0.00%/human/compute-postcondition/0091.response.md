Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the occurrences of '0' in the string `s` and the presence of '1' before each '0'. Specifically, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each '0' that has at least one '1' preceding it, and by the difference between the total number of zeros and the count of '0's seen so far for each '1'. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated `ans` for each test case.**
