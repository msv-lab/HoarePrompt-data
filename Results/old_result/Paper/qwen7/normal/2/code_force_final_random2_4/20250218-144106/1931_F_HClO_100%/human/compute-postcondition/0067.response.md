Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `idx2` is equal to the new value of `i`.**

Explanation: The line `idx2 = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `idx2`. Since `i` was already incremented by 1 before this line, `idx2` now holds this incremented value. The initial condition and other variables remain unchanged.
