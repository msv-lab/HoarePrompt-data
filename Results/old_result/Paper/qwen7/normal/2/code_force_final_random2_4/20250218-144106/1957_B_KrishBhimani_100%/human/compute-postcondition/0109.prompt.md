Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    if n == 1:
        print(k)
    else:
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        ans = []
        temp = 1
        while True:
            if temp * 2 < k:
                temp *= 2
                i += 1
            else:
                break
        ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
        ans.append(k - sum(ans))
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`. If `n` equals 1, then `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`. Otherwise, `i` is either 0 or 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing three elements `(1 << i) - 1`, `0`, and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is either the final value it reached after being doubled as many times as possible without exceeding `k`, or 2 if doubling did not occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer. If `n` equals 1, the function does not change the values of `i`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`, and adds zeros to `ans` to match the length of `n`. Otherwise, `i` is either 0 or 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`. If `n == 1`, the function does not change `k0`, `arr`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp`. Otherwise, `k0` equals `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is the final value determined by the loop (either the number of times the loop executed or one less than that), `ans` is a list containing `(1 << i) - 1`, and `temp` is 2 if `temp * 2 >= k` after the last iteration of the loop, otherwise `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`; `ans` now contains `k - sum(ans)`, and `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
