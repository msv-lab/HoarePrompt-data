Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop is defined as `for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:`.
   - This means that the loop iterates over every second line starting from the third line from standard input.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `line` is the third line (or any subsequent valid line) from standard input.
   - `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` on whitespace.

3. **Determine the Next Line:**
   - Since the loop iterates over every second line starting from the third line, the next line would be the fifth line, seventh line, and so on.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The variable `line` needs to be set to the next valid line, which is the fifth line from standard input.
   - The variable `elements` should be updated to reflect the split of this new line on whitespace.

### Final State:

State: **`line` is the fifth line from standard input, `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` on whitespace**.
