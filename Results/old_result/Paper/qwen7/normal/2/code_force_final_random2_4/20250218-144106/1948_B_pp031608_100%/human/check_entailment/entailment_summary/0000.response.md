Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array from the end to the beginning.
2. For each pair of consecutive elements, it checks if the first element is greater than the second element.
3. If it finds such a pair, it splits the first element into its individual digits and checks if the resulting list of numbers (including the second element) is sorted.
4. If the list of numbers is not sorted, it sets the answer to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
5. Finally, it prints "YES" if the answer is `True`, otherwise "NO".

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The program does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits.
- It assumes that splitting the first element and appending the second element will always result in a sorted sequence, which is not necessarily true.
- The program does not actually perform the digit splitting and reinsertion; it only checks if the sequence would be sorted after such an operation.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
