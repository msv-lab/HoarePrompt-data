Output State: **`d.get(i)` is incremented by 1, `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`.**

Explanation:
- The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d.get(i)` by 1. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, it becomes `1`. If `d.get(i)` was not `None`, it is incremented by 1.
- The code does not affect the value of `pl` directly, but it ensures that `i` is added to `pl` if it was not already present.
- The value of `i` remains the same as the next element in `palka` after `i_val`.

Therefore, the updated states are as described in the output state.
