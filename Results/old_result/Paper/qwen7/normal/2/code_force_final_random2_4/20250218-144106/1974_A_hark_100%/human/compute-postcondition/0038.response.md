Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is 1, `x` is an input integer from the first input split, `y` is an input integer from the second input split, `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`.**

The code `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the ceiling value of `y / 2` and assigns it to the variable `bxsfory`. The other variables remain unchanged.
