Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is the final value determined by the loop (either the number of times the loop executed or one less than that), `ans` is a list containing `(1 << i) - 1`, and `temp` is 2 if `temp * 2 >= k` after the last iteration of the loop, otherwise `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`; `ans` now contains `k - sum(ans)`**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(k - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially contains `(1 << i) - 1`, the new value appended is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
