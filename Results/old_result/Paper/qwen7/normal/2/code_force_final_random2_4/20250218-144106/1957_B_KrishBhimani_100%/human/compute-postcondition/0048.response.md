Output State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1.**

The code initializes `temp` to 1. This does not affect the values of `i`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `temp` is updated to 1.
