Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where there are duplicate cards in your hand correctly. According to the problem description, each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice among the 2n cards. However, the program calculates the maximum points you can get by assuming that each integer appears at most once in your hand. This leads to an incorrect result when there are duplicates.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 2
```

In this case, you have two cards with the number 1 and two cards with the number 2. If you play optimally, you can score 2 points by playing one card with the number 1 and one card with the number 2. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the result as 0 because it assumes each integer appears at most once.

To fix this, the program needs to account for the fact that each integer appears exactly twice and adjust the calculation accordingly.
