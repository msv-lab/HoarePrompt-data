Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**.

The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a` in place, changing its order from ascending to descending. All other variables (`n`, `k`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
