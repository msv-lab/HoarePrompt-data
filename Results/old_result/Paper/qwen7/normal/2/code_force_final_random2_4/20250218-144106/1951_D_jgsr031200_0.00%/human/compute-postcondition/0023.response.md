Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `i` is 1, `h` is `n`, `curr` is `n`, `n` is `n - curr`**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `n` is set to some value, `i` is 1, `h` is `n // 1 + curr` which simplifies to `n + n` since `curr` is `n`, and `curr` is `n`.
- The code `n -= i * curr` subtracts `i * curr` from `n`. Since `i` is 1 and `curr` is `n`, this effectively means `n` is reduced by `n`, resulting in `n` being updated to `n - n`, which is 0.
- All other variables (`costs`, `i`, `h`, `curr`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state includes the updated value of `n` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
