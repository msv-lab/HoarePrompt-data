Output State: **`bigList` has its last element removed, and `smallList` now has its last element removed.**

Explanation: The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. The precondition that `smallList` must have at least one element remains valid, and the last element of `smallList` is now removed. The state of `bigList` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned that its last element was removed initially, and no operation was performed on it.
