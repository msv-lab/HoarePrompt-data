Output: **NO**

Explanation: The initial state provides the following information:
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))`. However, the actual value of `new` is not provided, so we cannot determine the value of `new_all`.
- `check_all_new` retains its previous value, but its value is not relevant to the `print` statement.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'. Since no other variables or objects are being printed, the output is exactly as written: 'NO'.
