Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for j in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Postconditions at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty string.
   - `j` is the last character of `a`.
   - `l` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `j` is 'A'.
   - `h` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `j` is not 'A'.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be a non-empty string.
   - The value of `j` will change to the second-to-last character of `a` (since it was the last character in the previous iteration).
   - `l` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.
   - `h` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 again.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `a` remains a non-empty string but now its length is reduced by 1 because `j` is no longer the last character.
   - `j` becomes the second-to-last character of `a`.
   - `l` is updated based on the new value of `j`.
   - `h` is updated based on the new value of `j`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty string with its length reduced by 1, `j` is the second-to-last character of `a`, `l` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `j` is 'A', `h` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `j` is not 'A', and `i` is `i + 1`**.
