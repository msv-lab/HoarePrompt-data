Output State: **`L` is 33334, `R` is 33335, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 33334, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the range between `L` and `R` converges to the smallest possible interval where `R - L` is no more than 1. Given that the initial range was from 1 to 100001, and considering the precision of integer division, the final range narrows down to 33334 and 33335. Since `numCuts` remains 0 throughout the iterations and does not meet the condition to update `R`, the final value of `R` will be 33335 (the ceiling of the average of the range), and `L` will be 33334 (the floor of the average). The variable `x` will be the midpoint of the final range, which is 33334. The `dfs(1, 1)` function call results in the value of `leftover`, which is not modified during the loop iterations.
