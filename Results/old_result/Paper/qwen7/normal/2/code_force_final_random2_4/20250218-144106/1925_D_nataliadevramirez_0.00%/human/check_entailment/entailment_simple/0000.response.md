Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the expected value contribution of each friendship pair for all `k` excursions.
   - For each friendship `(a, b, f)`, the expected value contribution is `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
   - This calculation is correct because the probability of choosing any specific pair in `k` excursions is `k * (k + 1) // 2 / (n * (n - 1))`, but since we are only interested in the expected value and not the exact probability, we can directly use `k * (k + 1) // 2` as the expected count of times the pair is chosen.
   - The function correctly returns the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of friendships.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.
   - The logic and the flow of the function are correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The main function `func_2` is called at the end, which handles the input/output and manages the test cases.
   - The program structure is correct and follows the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
