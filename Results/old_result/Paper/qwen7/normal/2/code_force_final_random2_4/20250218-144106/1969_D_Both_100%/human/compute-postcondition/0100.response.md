Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `k` iterations in total. Therefore, the `heap` will contain the last tuple from the `combined` list after all iterations. `current_profit` and `max_profit` remain unchanged at 0 because no operations that modify these variables are mentioned in the loop body. `remaining_items` is still an empty list. `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`. `n` is the return value of `func_2()`. `k` is now equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, which is the length of `combined`. `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`.

In summary, the `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined`, and all other variables retain their previous states.
