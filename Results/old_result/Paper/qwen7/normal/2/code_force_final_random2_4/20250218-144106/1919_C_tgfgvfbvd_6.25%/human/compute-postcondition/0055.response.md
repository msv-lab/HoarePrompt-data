Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `x` in the range from `y + 1` to `n`.

3. **Determine the initial values**:
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `y` is equal to `n - 1`.

4. **Calculate the starting value of `x`**:
   - Since `y = n - 1`, the starting value of `x` is `y + 1`, which is `(n - 1) + 1 = n`.

5. **Loop execution**:
   - The loop starts with `x = n` and continues as long as `x < n`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` would have been `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes `n + 1`.

7. **Maintain the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `x < n`.
   - Therefore, `x` must be less than `n` for the next iteration.

8. **Update the required states**:
   - `n` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `y` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `x` is updated to `n + 1`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`**.
