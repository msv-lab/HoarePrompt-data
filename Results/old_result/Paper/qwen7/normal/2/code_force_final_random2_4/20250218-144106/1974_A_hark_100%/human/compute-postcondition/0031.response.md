Output: **math.ceil(x / 15)**

Explanation: Based on the initial state, `x` is an input integer, and there is no specific value provided for `x`. Therefore, the expression `x / 15` will result in a floating-point number, and `math.ceil(x / 15)` will return the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`. Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, the output remains as the expression itself.
