Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `cn2` remains `n * (n - 1) // 2`; `j` is -1; `sum_f` is 0; `p` is `p // gcd`; `q` is `2 * (cn2) // gcd`; `i` is 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The line `sum_f = 0` sets the variable `sum_f` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
