Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to solve the problem by processing each test case and handling multiple queries.
2. The program reads the necessary inputs for each test case and processes them to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
3. The program uses a lambda function to read input values and processes the list `a` to calculate some intermediate values stored in `b`.
4. The logic for calculating the minimum cost involves determining the closest city and using the precomputed values in `b` to find the result for each query.
5. The program correctly handles the constraints and the unique closest city condition mentioned in the problem statement.
6. The execution summary indicates that the function processes test cases and queries as expected, calculating and printing the required results.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be designed to solve the problem correctly based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
