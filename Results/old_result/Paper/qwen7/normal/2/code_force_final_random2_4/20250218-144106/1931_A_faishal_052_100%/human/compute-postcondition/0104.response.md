Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and the constant `cases`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `cases`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
   - `info` contains a list which is a copy of `arr`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < cases`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must have been incremented by 1 from its value in the previous iteration.
   - Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
   - The value of `cases` remains unchanged.

5. **Updating the State**:
   - `arr` remains sorted in ascending order.
   - `info` still contains a list which is a copy of `arr`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `info` contains a list which is a copy of `arr`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.
