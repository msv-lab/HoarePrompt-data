Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is r[0], m is r[1], x1 is r[2], y1 is r1 + 1, x2 is r[4], y2 is r[5], x2 is greater than x1, and (x2 - x1) is odd, and y1 is not equal to y2, and the current value of y2 is greater than y1**

In this output state, the value of `y1` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions that `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1)` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2` and `y2` is greater than `y1` are still valid.
