Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer. If `h` is greater than 12, then `h` is adjusted to be within the range 1 to 12 by subtracting 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains as 'AM'.
