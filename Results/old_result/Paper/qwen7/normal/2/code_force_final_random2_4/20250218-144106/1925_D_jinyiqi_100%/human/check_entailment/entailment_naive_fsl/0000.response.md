Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the numerator `p` and denominator `q` without considering the probability of choosing each pair of friends.

The program calculates `p` and `q` as follows:
- `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
- `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`

However, the correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. For each pair of friends `(a, b)` with friendship value `f`, the expected increase in the friendship value per excursion is `k / cn2`. Therefore, the expected value for each pair is `f * k / cn2`.

The correct calculation should be:
- `p = sum(f * k for (a, b, f) in friends)`
- `q = cn2`

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friends = []
        for j in range(m):
            (a, b, f) = map(int, input().split())
            friends.append((a, b, f))
        
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        sum_f = sum(f for _, _, f in friends)
        p = sum(f * k for _, _, f in friends)
        q = cn2
        
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        p = p // gcd
        q = q // gcd
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))

func()
```

This corrected program properly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions, ensuring it meets the problem description for every potential case.
