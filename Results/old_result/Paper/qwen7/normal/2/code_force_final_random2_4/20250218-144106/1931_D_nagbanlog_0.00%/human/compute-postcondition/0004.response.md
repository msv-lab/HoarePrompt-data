Output State: **`n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is equal to `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
