Output State: **`a` must not be an empty iterable, op is the result of op ^= val >> i & 1.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. Here's a breakdown of what happens:

- `val >> i & 1` shifts `val` right by `i` bits and then performs a bitwise AND with 1. This operation extracts the `i`-th bit (0-based indexing) from `val`.
- The `^=` operator performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `op` and the result of the previous operation, and then assigns the result back to `op`.

Since the initial values of `val`, `i`, and `op` are not specified, the exact numerical value of `op` cannot be determined. However, we know that `op` has been updated according to the given operation. The precondition that `a` must not be an empty iterable remains unchanged.
