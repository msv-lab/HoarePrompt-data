Output State: **`a[i]` is now equal to the original value of `b[i]`; `b[i]` is now equal to the original value of `a[i]`; `f` is 1; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `f`. The values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
