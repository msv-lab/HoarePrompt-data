Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(a3, l3)` in the `val` list. This means the variables `a3` and `l3` are the ones we need to consider.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` holds true. This means that if `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the loop will continue.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a3` is the current element from `val`.
   - `l3` is the list associated with `a3` in `val`.

4. **Check the Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` must still hold true. 

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `a3` and `l3` are the only variables in the loop head, they are the only ones that can be adjusted.
   - The new value of `a3` will be the next element from `val`.
   - The new value of `l3` will be the list associated with the new `a3` in `val`.

6. **Formulate the New State**: The new state should reflect these changes.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: `a3` is the next element from `val`, `l3` is the list associated with `a3` in `val`**.

Since the exact values of `a3` and `l3` depend on the specific elements in `val` and the list comprehension, we cannot provide concrete values without knowing the contents of `val`. However, the general form of the state is as described.

So, the final answer is:

**State: `a3` is the next element from `val`, `l3` is the list associated with `a3` in `val`**.
