Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `s` is the string input by the user and its length must be at least 3, `count` is 3, `flag` is True, `j` is 3. If `s[3]` is '0' and `s[4]` is '1', then `j` remains 3. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` remain unchanged.
