Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the balance and an empty list `details` to store the balance, position, and character information.
2. It iterates over each character in the input string `s`, updating the balance and appending a tuple containing the current balance, negative position (to ensure higher positions are prioritized in case of equal balances), and the character itself to the `details` list.
3. After collecting all the necessary data, the `details` list is sorted based on the balance values. If there are ties in balance, the negative position ensures that characters from later positions in the original string take precedence.
4. Finally, the program constructs a new string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list and prints the result.

Given the steps and the logic described in the problem statement, the program appears to follow the correct approach to perform the balanced shuffle operation. The sorting mechanism ensures that the characters are placed in the correct order based on their balance values, and the construction of the result string follows the specified rules.

Correctness: **True**
