Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string from input.**

The code `arr = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. This input can be any string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
