### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **String Processing**: For each test case, the program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string `a`.
3. **Comparison and Output**: The program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' and prints the appropriate character ('A' or 'B') based on which count is higher.
4. **Edge Cases**: Since the problem specifies that each string is of length 5 and consists only of 'A' and 'B', there are no edge cases to handle beyond the basic logic.
5. **State Analysis**: The state analysis at the end of the program confirms that the variables `l` and `h` contain the correct counts of 'A' and 'B' respectively, and the program prints the expected result based on these counts.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all specified conditions without any logical errors, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
