Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, the values of `c` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string by space.**

In this output state, the variables `t`, `i`, and `k` retain their initial conditions. The variables `c` and `r` are updated to be the integers obtained from splitting the input string by space.
