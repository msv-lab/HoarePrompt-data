Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is 0.**

The code initializes `b` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
