Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, and `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the value of `k`. The variable `num` will hold the total count of 1s and 2s added during each iteration, where 1 is added if `c` equals `r`, and 2 is added otherwise. The values of `t`, `c`, and `r` will reflect the last input provided during the loop's final iteration.
