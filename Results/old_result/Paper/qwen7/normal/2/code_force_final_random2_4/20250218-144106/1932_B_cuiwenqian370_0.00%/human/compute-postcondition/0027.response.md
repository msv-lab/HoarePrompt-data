Based on the initial state provided, `results` must have at least one element. However, no specific value or type of the elements in `results` is given. Therefore, we can only say that `results` contains at least one element, but we cannot determine the exact value of the element that will be printed.

Output: **result (where result is the first element of the `results` list, since it must have at least one element)**
