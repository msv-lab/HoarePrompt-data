State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable in the for loop is `i`.
2. The loop runs based on the value of `t` using the expression `range(t)`.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0). However, since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` in each iteration, `t` must be strictly greater than 0 for the loop to run at least once.
4. The initial values of `start`, `end`, and `results` do not affect the loop's execution directly, but they are part of the overall program state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 0 and `t` must be greater than 0.
