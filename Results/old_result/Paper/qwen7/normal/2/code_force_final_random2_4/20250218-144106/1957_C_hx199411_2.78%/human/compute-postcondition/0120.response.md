Output State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 1, `num` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 2, `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input, `c` and `r` are assigned the values from the split input separated by a space.**

The code takes two inputs separated by a space and splits them into two integers, assigning these integers to `c` and `r` respectively. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
