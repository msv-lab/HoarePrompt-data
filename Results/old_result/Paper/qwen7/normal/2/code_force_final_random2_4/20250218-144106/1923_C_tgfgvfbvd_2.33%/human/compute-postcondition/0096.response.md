Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, `p` is unchanged**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Since `s` was initially equal to `p[b - 1]`, the new value of `s` becomes `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
