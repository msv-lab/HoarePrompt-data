Output State: **`j` must be less than 2, `lex` is equal to 2, `arr` contains the value 26**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Given that `lex` was initially between 28 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), subtracting 26 from it results in a value of 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
