Output State: **`total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is incremented by 1 (so `op` is now `op + 1`), `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `b` is a sorted version of list `a`.**

The code `op += 1` increments the value of `op` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
