Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0 are still valid.
