Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive); `arr` contains the elements 26, 26, 26**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 26. Given that `lex` was either less than 52 or between -26 and 52 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from `lex` shifts its range. Specifically, if `lex` was in the range -26 to 26 (inclusive), it remains in the range -26 to 26 (inclusive) after the subtraction. If `lex` was in the range 27 to 51, it would now be in the range -1 to 25, but since the initial condition does not specify which exact value `lex` had, we keep the broader condition that `lex` is either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive). The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
