Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case consisting of an integer `t`, followed by `t` lists, each containing `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive, and appears at most twice. For each list, the function returns whether all integers within the list appear at most twice.**
