Output State: `a` and `b` are strings, `i` is 4, `f` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the length of string `a`. Since the output state after 3 iterations shows that `i` is 2, it means the loop has completed 3 iterations. Therefore, when the loop finishes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of string `a`, which is 4 in this case. No swaps have occurred, so `f` remains 0.
