Output State: **The list `ans` will contain all integers from 1 to 20, excluding the value at index `i` if `i` is less than 20.**

To understand this output state, let's break down the loop logic and its behavior over multiple iterations:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is initialized based on user input.
   - For each test case (`tc`), `n` and `k` are read from input.
   - The variable `i` is set to 0 and incremented until \(1 << (i + 1)\) exceeds `k`.

2. **Building `ans`**:
   - `ans` starts with three predefined values: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
   - Then, it appends all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{19}\) (i.e., from 1 to 1024) to `ans`, except for the value at index `i`.

3. **Printing `ans`**:
   - The length of `ans` is printed first.
   - Then, the elements of `ans` are printed.

Given that the loop runs for each test case independently, and considering the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

- After the first iteration, `ans` contains all integers from 1 to 1024.
- After the second iteration, `ans` contains all integers from 1 to 1024, but with the value at index 10 excluded.
- After the third iteration, `ans` contains all integers from 1 to 20, but with the value at index `i` (which is 19 in this case) excluded.

Since there is no upper limit given for `t`, and the problem specifies that the loop should run for all test cases, the final state of `ans` will be determined by the last iteration. In the last iteration, `i` will be 19, and `ans` will contain all integers from 1 to 20, except for the value at index 19.

Thus, the final output state is a list containing all integers from 1 to 20, excluding the value at index 19.
