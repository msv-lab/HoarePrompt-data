Output State: **`current_profit` is updated by subtracting `removed_item[0]`, `heap` is modified by pushing `item` and popping the smallest element, `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order with the last item popped, `removed_item` is true.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` subtracts the value of `removed_item[0]` from `current_profit`. The other variables (`heap`, `combined`, and `removed_item`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
