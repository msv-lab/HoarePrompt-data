Postcondition: `idx1` is `-1` or `i`, `idx2` is `-1` or `i`, `p1` is `1` or `0`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `n` is greater than `1`, and either both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to `0` (in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) or the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is met and we break out of the loop or if statement.
