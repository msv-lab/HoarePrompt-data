Output State: **`final` is now [0], `mini` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `0`, it becomes `[0]`. The values of `mini`, `pk`, and `c1` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The condition that `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 is also preserved.
