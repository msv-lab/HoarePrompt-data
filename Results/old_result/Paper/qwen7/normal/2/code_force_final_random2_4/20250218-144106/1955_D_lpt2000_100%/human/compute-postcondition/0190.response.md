Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `C[out_aa]` has been incremented by 1, while `D[out_aa]` and `pairs_in_D` have each been decreased by 1. The initial conditions of `D[out_aa]` being decreased by 1 and `pairs_in_D` being decreased by 1 remain valid.
