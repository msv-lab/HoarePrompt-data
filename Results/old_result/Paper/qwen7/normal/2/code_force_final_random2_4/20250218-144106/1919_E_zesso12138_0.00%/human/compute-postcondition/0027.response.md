Output State: The `index` is increased by the sum of `t` and `n-1`, `t` is 0 since it decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0, `n` is the last integer value assigned to `n` within the loop (which is `data[index]` after the last iteration), `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` for each iteration, appended with `result` for each iteration, and thus `results` now contains `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each respective iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `index` will be at the position right after the last processed element in `data`, `t` will be 0, `n` will be the size of the last processed array `p`, `p` will contain the last set of integers processed, `data` remains unchanged, `results` will contain the outputs of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.
