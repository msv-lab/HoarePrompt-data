Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `n` remains an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is now `n-2`, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` contains a list of all nodes connected to node `a`, and `adj[b]` contains a list of all nodes connected to node `b`; `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`, which calculates the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Given `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, `(1 + 100001) // 2` equals 50001. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
