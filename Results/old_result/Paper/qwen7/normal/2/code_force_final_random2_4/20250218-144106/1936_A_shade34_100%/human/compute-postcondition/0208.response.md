Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the element `n-1`, and `s` is a string input from the user which is not equal to `<`. If `s` is equal to `'='`, the function does nothing additional to `pans`. If `s` is not equal to `'='`, the function also does nothing additional to `pans`.
