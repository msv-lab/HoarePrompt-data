Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list with the additional element `a[l]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[l])` appends the element `a[l]` to the list `b`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `b` gains an additional element, which is `a[l]`.
