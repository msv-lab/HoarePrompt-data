Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This means `t` can take any integer value from 1 to 1000.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `k` is the second integer input.
   - `num_iterations` must be greater than 0. This variable is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output directly.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
   ```

   This statement uses a conditional expression to determine what to print:
   - If `n - k <= 1`, then `n` is printed.
   - Otherwise, `1` is printed.

To determine the exact output, we need to consider the relationship between `n` and `k`:
- If `n - k <= 1`, then the output will be `n`.
- If `n - k > 1`, then the output will be `1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we can only describe the output based on the conditions provided.

Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1**
