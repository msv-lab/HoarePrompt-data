Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `a` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `b` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `f` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m`. Since `j` starts from 0, it will increment by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `m` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `m` stays the same.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
   - `f` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `sum_f` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted, and there is no explicit update to `sum_f` based on the information provided.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `j` and `m`.

Since `j` was incremented by 1 and `m` remains the same, the new state should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` remains the same**.

To be more precise and fit the required format:
State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`, `j` is `j + 1`, `m` must be the same**.
