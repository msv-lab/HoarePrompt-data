Output State: **`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. However, the initial value of `ans` is not specified, so we only know that `ans` is now `ans + m`. The variables `i` and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
