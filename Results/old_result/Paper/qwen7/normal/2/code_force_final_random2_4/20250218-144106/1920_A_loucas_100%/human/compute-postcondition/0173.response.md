Output State: **`no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is `num - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is decremented by 1. The list `no` remains unchanged as the code only affects `num`. Since `no` contains at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2, this condition still holds true.
