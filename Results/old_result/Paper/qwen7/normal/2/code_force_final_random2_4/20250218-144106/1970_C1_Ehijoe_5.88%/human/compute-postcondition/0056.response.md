Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` is appended to the list `tree`, `v` is an input integer**

The code `tree.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `tree`. Since `u` is an input integer, its specific value is not known, but it is added to the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
