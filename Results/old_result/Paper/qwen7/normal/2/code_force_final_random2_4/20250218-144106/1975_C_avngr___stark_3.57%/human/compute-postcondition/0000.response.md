Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state of `t` is defined as a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
