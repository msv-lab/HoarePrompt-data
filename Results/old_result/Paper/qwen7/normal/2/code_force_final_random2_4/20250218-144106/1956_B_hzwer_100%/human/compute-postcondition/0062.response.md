Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in cnt:`. Here, `x` is the variable that will take each value from the list `cnt`, and `cnt` itself is the iterable.

2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute. This means we need to check the state of `cnt` and `x`.

3. **Analyze the given state**:
   - `cnt` is `[1, 2, 0]`.
   - `ans` is `8`.
   - `a` is a list of integers that contains exactly two integers.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `cnt`. Since `cnt` is a list with three elements, the loop will execute three times.
   - For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be a non-empty list (which it is).
   - The variable `x` will take the values `1`, `2`, and `0` in sequence during the iterations.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `cnt` is `[1, 2, 0]` and must remain a list with these exact values for the loop to execute.
   - `x` will take the values `1`, `2`, and `0` in sequence, but since we don't know the exact order of execution, we can say that `x` will be one of these values.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `cnt` and `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` is [1, 2, 0], `x` will be one of the values 1, 2, or 0**
