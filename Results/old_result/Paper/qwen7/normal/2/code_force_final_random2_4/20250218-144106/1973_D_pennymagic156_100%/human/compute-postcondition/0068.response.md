Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n // k + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `k` is `k - 3 * cnt`
   - `l` is `func_2() + cnt`
   - `cnt` is 0
   - `l` is less than `n + 1`
   - `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n // k + 1`. Given that `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue if `n // k + 1 > 1`, which simplifies to `n // k >= 1` or `n >= k`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is not directly modified in the loop head.
   - `l` remains unchanged because it is not directly modified in the loop head.
   - `cnt` remains 0 because it is not directly modified in the loop head.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a positive integer (unchanged)
   - `k` is `k - 3 * cnt` (unchanged)
   - `l` is `func_2() + cnt` (unchanged)
   - `cnt` is 0 (unchanged)
   - `l` is less than `n + 1` (unchanged)
   - `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3 * cnt`, `l` is `func_2() + cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is less than `n + 1`, and `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)`**
