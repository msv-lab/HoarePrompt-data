Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is `c + 1`, but since the initial value of `c` is not specified, it will simply be incremented by 1.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an integer input.

The print statement is `print('##..')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs a string and does not depend on the values of `c`, `t`, or `n`, the output will be exactly as written in the print statement.

Output: **##..**
