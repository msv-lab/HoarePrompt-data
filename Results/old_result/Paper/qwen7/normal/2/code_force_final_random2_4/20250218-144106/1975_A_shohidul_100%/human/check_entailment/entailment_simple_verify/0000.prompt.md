You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: t is a positive integer between 1 and 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-2` are less than or equal to the next element, and the final output of the program is determined based on the conditions checked within the loop. If `check_all` remains `True` throughout all iterations and no segment of the list `a` from index `i` to the end satisfies both `check_all_new` and `new_all` being `True`, the program will print 'NO'. Otherwise, if any segment satisfies these conditions, the program will print 'YES'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array can be split and rearranged to form a non-decreasing sequence correctly. Specifically, the program checks if the entire array is already non-decreasing, which is not sufficient. It also attempts to check if the subarray after the split can be rearranged to fit the condition, but the logic is flawed.

For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 2, 4]`. According to the problem description, we can split this array into `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`, and then swap them to get `[2, 4, 1, 3]`, which is not sorted. However, the program would incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to the last element of the subarray after the split, which is not a valid condition for sorting the array.

A correct approach would involve checking if the array can be split and rearranged such that the resulting array is non-decreasing. This requires more complex logic to verify the conditions under which the array can be split and rearranged.
