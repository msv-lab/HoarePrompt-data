Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`, `op` is increased by 1, and `b` is now a sorted version of the original `b` list.**

Explanation: The code `new_median = b[ma]` assigns the value of the element at index `ma` in the list `b` to the variable `new_median`. Since `ma` is defined as `num2 / 2`, `new_median` is set to the element at index `num2 / 2` in the list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
