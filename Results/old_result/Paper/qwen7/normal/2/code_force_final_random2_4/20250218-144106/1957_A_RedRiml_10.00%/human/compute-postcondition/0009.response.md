Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element with the first element being `i`, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` and value `1`, and the current value of `i` is an integer for which `d.get(i)` returns `1`.**

This means that the dictionary `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`, where `i` is the same integer for which `d.get(i)` previously returned `None`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
