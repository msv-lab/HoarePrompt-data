Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is a string**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer. Since `a` was originally a string, after executing this line, `a` becomes an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
