Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Case 1: \( n < k \)**:
   - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she needs to buy, it is impossible for her to buy \( k \) jewels. Hence, the program prints "NO".
3. **Case 2: \( n = k \)**:
   - If Alice has exactly \( k \) coins, she can buy exactly \( k \) jewels by setting the price of each stall to 1 coin. Hence, the program prints "YES", followed by 1 (the number of stalls), and then \( n \) (the price of each stall).
4. **Case 3: \( n > k \)**:
   - The program incorrectly handles this case. It should be able to distribute the coins across multiple stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels. However, the current implementation only considers two specific scenarios:
     - If \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \), it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.
     - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, the logic for distributing coins across multiple stalls is incomplete and does not cover all possible scenarios. For example, if \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \), the program incorrectly prints "NO". Additionally, the program does not explore other possible distributions of prices across multiple stalls to achieve the goal.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

Correctness: **False**
