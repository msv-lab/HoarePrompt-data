Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is an integer) to the variable `t`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
