Based on the initial state provided:

- `total_costs` contains the sum of costs from index `i` to `i + k - 1` for every possible `i` such that `0 <= i <= len(costs) - k`.

The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value among all these sums.

To explain further:
- For each `i` in the range `0` to `len(costs) - k`, `total_costs[i]` stores the sum of `costs[i]` to `costs[i + k - 1]`.
- The `min(total_costs)` function finds the smallest value in this list of sums.
- This smallest value is then printed.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum sum of any `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs[i] is the sum of costs from index i to i + k - 1 for every possible i such that 0 <= i <= len(costs) - k)**
