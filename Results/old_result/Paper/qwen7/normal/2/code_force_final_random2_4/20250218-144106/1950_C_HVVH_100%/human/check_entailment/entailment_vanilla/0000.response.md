Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`. This is correct as the day starts at `'AM'`.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which is the number of test cases. This part is correct and expected.

3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, the program splits the input string `s` (which is in the format `hh:mm`) into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`). This is done using `map(int, input().split(':'))`, which is correct.

4. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If `h` is `0`, it is converted to `12` and `day` remains `'AM'`. This is correct.
   - If `h` is greater than `12`, it is adjusted by subtracting `12` and `day` changes to `'PM'`. This is correct.
   - If `h` is between `1` and `11`, `day` is set to `'AM'`. This is correct.
   - If `h` is `12`, `day` is set to `'PM'`. This is correct.

5. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the time in the format `hh:mm` followed by `day` (either `'AM'` or `'PM'`). This is correct.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic for setting `day` when `h` is `12`. According to the problem statement, `12:00` should be printed as `"12:00 PM"`. But the current code sets `day` to `'AM'` when `h` is `12` and then changes it to `'PM'` if `h` is `12` again, which is redundant and unnecessary.

To fix this, we can simplify the logic for setting `day`:

- If `h` is `0`, set `h` to `12` and `day` to `'AM'`.
- If `h` is greater than `12`, adjust `h` by subtracting `12` and set `day` to `'PM'`.
- If `h` is between `1` and `11`, set `day` to `'AM'`.
- If `h` is `12`, set `day` to `'PM'`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

Given the original logic and the potential redundancy, the original program is almost correct but could be simplified. However, the provided solution still works correctly for all given test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
