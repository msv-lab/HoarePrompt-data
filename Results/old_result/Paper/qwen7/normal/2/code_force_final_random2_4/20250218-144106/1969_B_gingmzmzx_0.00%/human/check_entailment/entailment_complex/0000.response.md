Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly solve the given problem. The logic in the function `func_1()` does not accurately calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order through cyclic shifts.

Hereâ€™s why the program is incorrect:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The program counts the number of '0's and the positions of '1's relative to '0's, but it does not account for the minimum cost required to achieve a sorted string via cyclic shifts.
2. **Misunderstanding of Cyclic Shifts**: The program does not consider the actual cost associated with performing cyclic shifts on substrings. It incorrectly assumes that counting '0's and their positions relative to '1's will give the minimum cost, which is not true.
3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input "10", the output is 2, which is correct because a single cyclic shift is needed.
   - For the input "0000", the output is 0, which is correct because no shifts are needed.
   - For the input "11000", the output is 9, which is incorrect. The correct minimum cost is 3, not 9. One optimal strategy would be to perform three cyclic shifts on the substring "11000" to get "00011".

Given these points, the function does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost for sorting the binary string through cyclic shifts.

Correctness: **False**
