You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, lista_A is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and lista_B is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `soma_b` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `n - k - 1`. If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, `soma_b` remains unchanged and `pref` is set to `soma_b + lista_A[i]`. Otherwise, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]` and `pref` remains unchanged.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `soma_b` will hold the sum of `lista_A[i]` for all `i` where `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` and `i` ranges from `0` to `n - k - 1`. The variable `pref` will be the cumulative sum of `soma_b + lista_A[i]` whenever `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, otherwise, it will be `0` for those cases. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - k - 1`, so the final value of `i` will be `n - k - 1`. The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain in their reversed states as they are not modified within the loop.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` from index `n - k` to the end of the list, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `lista_A` remains the same, `lista_B` remains the same, `pref` remains the same, `i` is the last value it was set to within the range `[n - k, n)`, `resultado` is the minimum value it was updated to during the loop, which is the minimum of `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all iterations of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `soma_b` will be the sum of all elements in `lista_B` starting from index `n - k` to the end of the list. The variable `resultado` will hold the smallest value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop, considering the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `pref`, and `i`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: the minimum value of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for all iterations of the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (with the condition 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` each containing `n` integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. It processes these inputs by comparing elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` in reverse order, calculating a cumulative sum (`soma_b`) of elements in `lista_B` and determining a prefix sum (`pref`) based on certain conditions. Finally, it computes the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for specific indices and prints this minimum value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numero_testes is an integer such that 1 ≤ numero_testes ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and the lists a and b are lists of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^3\) and \(\text{numero_testes} > 2\); `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.
    #
    #This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `numero_testes` will be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), but it will definitely be greater than 2, as the loop runs from 1 to `numero_testes - 1`. Additionally, `func_1()` will have been called exactly `numero_testes` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and two lists \(a\) and \(b\). It then calls `func_1()` exactly `numero_testes` times, where `numero_testes` is initially read from input and must be between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. After processing all test cases, `numero_testes` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1,000 inclusive, but it will always be greater than 2. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not accurately calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Costs**: The program attempts to reverse the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which is unnecessary and does not align with the problem description. The costs should be calculated from the start to the end of the queue, not reversed.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Costs**: The logic for calculating the total cost is flawed. The program does not properly account for the cumulative cost of bribing people between positions. It should consider the cost of bribing each person and the subsequent cost of bribing people between the current position and the target position.

3. **Incorrect Final Cost Calculation**: The final cost calculation in the loop is incorrect. It should consider the cumulative cost of bribing people from the current position to the target position, not just the last element added to `pref`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  4
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- **Expected Output**: The minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first 2 people is 14. This can be achieved by bribing the person at position 3 with 8 coins and the person at position 2 with 3 coins.

However, the provided program does not produce the correct output. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the prefix sum of b_i
    prefix_sum_b = [0] * n
    prefix_sum_b[0] = lista_B[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix_sum_b[i] = prefix_sum_b[i-1] + lista_B[i]
    
    # Initialize the result with infinity
    resultado = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate from n-k to n (Kirill's target position)
    for i in range(n-k, n):
        # Calculate the cost of bribing up to position i
        cost = lista_A[i] + prefix_sum_b[i-1] if i > 0 else lista_A[i]
        resultado = min(resultado, cost)
    
    print(resultado)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the minimum cost by considering the cumulative costs and ensuring Kirill is among the first `m` people in the queue.
