Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s`, `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed.**

Explanation: The code `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `p`, and the original `s` are not affected by this operation. The new `s` is the updated version of the original `s` with all 'map' occurrences removed.
