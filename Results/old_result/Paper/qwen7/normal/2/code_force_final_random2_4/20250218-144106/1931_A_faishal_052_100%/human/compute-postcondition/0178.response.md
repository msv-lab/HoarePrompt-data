Output State: `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96) + chr(info[0][2] + 96) + chr(info[0][3] + 96)`.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be incremented to 1 (since it starts at 0 and the loop runs for the length of `info[0]`, which is 4 elements, causing `i` to reach 1), `j` remains at 3 because the loop has completed, `cases` remains as a positive integer since it was not affected by the loop, and `temp` contains the concatenated string of characters derived from `info[0]` starting from index 0 up to index 3, each character being the ASCII representation of the index plus 96.
