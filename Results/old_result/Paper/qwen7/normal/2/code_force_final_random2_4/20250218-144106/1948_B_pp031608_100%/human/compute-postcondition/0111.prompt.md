Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]` if no swap was made during the last iteration, and `arr[i]` is unchanged or adjusted according to the loop conditions, `ans` is `True`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that the element at index `i-1` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `ans` is `False` if the elements in `nums` are not sorted (i.e., not in non-decreasing order). If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, then `ans` is set to `True` and the elements in `nums` are sorted. Otherwise, `ans` remains `False` and the elements in `nums` are not sorted.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `arr[i-1]` is equal to `nums[0]`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, then `ans` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, `arr[i-1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, and if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, then `arr[i-1]` is updated to `nums[0]` and the postcondition remains unchanged; otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
