Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` is a list of sorted integers
   - `r` is now `a[i + 1]`
   - `rem` is `0`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, the loop condition `i < n - 1` will be false, and the loop will not execute again.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed for `i` or `n` for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop does not execute again, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `ii` remains an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `a` remains a list of sorted integers.
   - `r` remains `a[i + 1]`, but since `i` is `n - 1`, `r` will be `a[n]` if `n` is within the bounds of the list.
   - `rem` remains `0`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which won't happen in this case) would be:

**State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is `a[n]` (if `n` is within bounds), and `rem` is `0`**.
