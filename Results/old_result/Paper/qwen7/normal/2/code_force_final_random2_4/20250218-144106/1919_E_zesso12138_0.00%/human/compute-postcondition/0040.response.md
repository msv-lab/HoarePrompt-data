Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The line `dp = new_dp` updates the `dp` list to be exactly the same as the `new_dp` list. Since the `new_dp` list was populated based on the rules given, the `dp` list now holds these updated values. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 1.
