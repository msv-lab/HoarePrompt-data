The function processes a series of test cases, each containing three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, it checks if n is less than k. If so, it prints 'NO'. If n equals k, it prints 'YES', 1, and n. If n is greater than k and k - 1 is less than n - k + 1, it prints 'YES', 2, n - k + 1, and 1. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
