Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a[0]` is greater than the current value of `a[1]`.
- `new` is a list starting from `a[2]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
