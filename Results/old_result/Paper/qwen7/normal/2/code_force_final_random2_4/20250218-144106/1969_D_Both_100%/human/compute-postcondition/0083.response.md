Output State: **`combined` is fully processed, `heap` is an empty list, `current_profit` reflects the final profit, `max_profit` holds the highest profit, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2(), and k` is the second return value of `func_2().**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `neg_prices` which contains the negative values of each element in the original `prices` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
