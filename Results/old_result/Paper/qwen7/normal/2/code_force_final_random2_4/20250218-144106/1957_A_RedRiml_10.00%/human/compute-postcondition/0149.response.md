Output State: **`shapes` is 3, `pl` must have at least one element, `j` is the current index plus 2, and the new value of `d[j]` (which is `d[j+1]`) is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code `shapes += 1` increments the value of `shapes` by 1. Initially, `shapes` was 2, so now it is 3. The conditions for `pl`, `j`, and the value of `d[j]` remain unchanged as no code affects them.
