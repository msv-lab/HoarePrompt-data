Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_i = i` simply reassigns the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to `i`. The values of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` and `curr_v` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state retains the same information as the initial state, just with the reassigned value for `multiples_of_k_plus_i`.
