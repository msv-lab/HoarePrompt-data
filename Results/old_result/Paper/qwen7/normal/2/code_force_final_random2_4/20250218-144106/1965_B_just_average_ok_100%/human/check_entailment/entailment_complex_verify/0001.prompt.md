You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. After all iterations, `idx` will be set to the largest index `i` such that `1 << i` is less than or equal to the maximum `k` value encountered across all test cases. The list `nums` will contain the following elements:
    #
    #- All powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
    #- For each `k` value, the elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
    #- The length of `nums` will be `24 + t`, as we start with 21 elements (powers of 2) and add 3 elements per test case.
    #
    #The final state of `nums` will include all the unique elements added during the iterations, and the length of `nums` will reflect the total number of unique elements plus the initial 21 elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \(t\), \(n\), and \(k\). For each test case, it calculates specific values based on \(k\) and appends these values to a list `nums`. The list initially contains all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). For each \(k\), it adds \(k - \text{max power of 2} \leq k\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + \text{max power of 2} + 1\) to `nums`, then removes the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\). After processing all test cases, the function prints the length of the final `nums` list and the list itself.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Sequence**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This is done using the list comprehension `[1 << i for i in range(21)]`.
   - It then iterates through this list to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This index is stored in `idx`.
   - If `nums[idx]` is greater than `k`, it breaks the loop.
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list `nums`.
   - Finally, it removes `1 << idx` from the list `nums`.

3. **Printing Output**:
   - The length of the list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of the list `nums` are printed.

### Checking the Logic
