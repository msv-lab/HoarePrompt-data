Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list at most 2 times; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` simply reassigns the `input` variable to refer to `sys.stdin.readline`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. It just updates what `input` refers to.
