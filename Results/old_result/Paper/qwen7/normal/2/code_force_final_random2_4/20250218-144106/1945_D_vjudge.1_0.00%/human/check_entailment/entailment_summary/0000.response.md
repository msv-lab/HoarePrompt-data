### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and execution summaries to determine if the program correctly solves the given problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Input**: 
  - Two integers `n` and `k` (with the condition \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 200,000\)).
  - Two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` each containing `n` integers ranging from 1 to \(10^9\).

- **Processing**:
  - The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed.
  - A variable `soma_b` is initialized to 0, which accumulates the sum of elements in `lista_B`.
  - A variable `pref` is used to store the prefix sum of elements in `lista_A` under certain conditions.
  - The loop iterates over the first `n-k` elements of the reversed lists, comparing `lista_A[i]` and `lista_B[i]`. If `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, `pref` is updated by adding `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`, and `soma_b` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is incremented by `lista_B[i]`.
  - Another loop iterates over the last `k` elements of the reversed lists, updating the result by considering the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.

- **Output**: 
  - The function prints the minimum number of coins required for Kirill to move to a position within the first `k` people in the queue.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input**: 
  - An integer `numero_testes` (number of test cases) ranging from 1 to 10,000.

- **Processing**:
  - The function reads `numero_testes` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
  - The function does not return any value but processes the test cases as specified.

### Analysis:
1. **Reversing Lists**: The reversal of lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` is unnecessary because the problem does not specify any need for reversing the lists. The original order should be used directly.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The logic for calculating the prefix sum (`pref`) and the cumulative sum (`soma_b`) seems correct. However, the conditions for updating these sums need careful consideration.
3. **Final Result Calculation**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `k` people is correct. The nested loops and conditional checks ensure that the minimum cost is found.

### Conclusion:
Given the execution summaries and the analysis of the code, the provided functions correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for processing each test case and calculating the minimum cost is sound.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
