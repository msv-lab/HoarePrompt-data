You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Program:
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        res = a.count(a[p])
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads a positive integer \( n \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers. It sorts the list and calculates the count of the middle element (or the average of the two middle elements if \( n \) is even) in the sorted list. The function prints this count for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. An operation consists of incrementing any element by 1.

2. **Median Calculation**: The median of an array of size `n` is the middle element when the array is sorted. If `n` is odd, the median is the element at index `(n+1)//2 - 1`. If `n` is even, both elements at indices `n//2 - 1` and `n//2` are considered, but we only need to focus on the element at `p = (n+1)//2 - 1` for the minimum operations calculation.

3. **Current Median**: The current median is the element at index `p` after sorting the array. The task is to count how many times this element appears in the array. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed because each operation can increment an element to match the current median.

4. **Analysis of the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It calculates the index `p` for the median.
   - It counts the occurrences of the element at index `p` using `a.count(a[p])`.
   - However, the code does not actually perform the operations to increase the median; it simply returns the count of the current median element. This does not solve the problem as stated.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating the median and counting its occurrences is correct.
   - However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median, which means the code should simulate or calculate the minimum operations needed, not just return the count of the current median.

Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It returns the count of the current median element instead of the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
