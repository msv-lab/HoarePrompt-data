Output State: **`iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the input, `big` contains all the values of `a` where `x == 1` was true, `less` contains all the values of `a` where `x == 2` was true, `no` contains all the values of `a` where `x != 2` was true, and `num` is equal to `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
