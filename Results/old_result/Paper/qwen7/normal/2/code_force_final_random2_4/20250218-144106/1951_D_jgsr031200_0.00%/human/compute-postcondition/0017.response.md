Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is increased by `n`, `n` is decreased by `curr`, `i` is 1, `curr` is `n // 1`**

Explanation: The code `curr = n // i` divides `n` by `i` (which is initially 1) using integer division. Since `i` is 1, `n // 1` equals `n`. Therefore, `curr` is assigned the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
