Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated as follows: if `i == 0`, then `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`. `ans` contains the value of the updated `sums`.
