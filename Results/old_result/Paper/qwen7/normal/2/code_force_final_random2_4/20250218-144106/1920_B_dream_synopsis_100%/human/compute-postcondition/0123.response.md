Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` contains `[sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x], sums]`**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains `[sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]]`. After appending `sums`, `ans` will contain both `[sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]]` and `sums`, which can be represented as `[sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x], sums]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
