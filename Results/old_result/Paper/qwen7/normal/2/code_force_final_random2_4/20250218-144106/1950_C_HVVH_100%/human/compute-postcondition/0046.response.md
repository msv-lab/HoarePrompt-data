Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is 'PM', `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer, `day` is assigned the value 'PM'**.

In this case, the only change is that the `day` variable has been updated from 'AM' to 'PM'. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
