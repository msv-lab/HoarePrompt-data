Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` are unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are unchanged, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `totalOne` to `ol` and `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. The values of `el`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `preOne`, `ans`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
