The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list `x` + 1), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then constructs a list `a` where each element is derived from the cumulative subtraction of elements in `x`. Finally, it prints a string representation of the list `a` with elements separated by spaces. After processing all test cases, the function ends.
