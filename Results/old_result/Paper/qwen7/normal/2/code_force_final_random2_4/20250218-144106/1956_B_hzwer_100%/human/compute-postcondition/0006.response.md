Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. The variables involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x` is the variable that will take on the values from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `n` is the number of integers input from `sys.stdin.readline`, the list `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `x` will change during each iteration, but before the loop starts, we only need to ensure that `a` is not empty.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element**
