Output State: **`max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.**

The code sorts the `combined` list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple using the `sort` method with a lambda function as the key. The sorting does not change the values of `max_profit` and `current_profit`, but it changes the order of the elements in the `combined` list.
