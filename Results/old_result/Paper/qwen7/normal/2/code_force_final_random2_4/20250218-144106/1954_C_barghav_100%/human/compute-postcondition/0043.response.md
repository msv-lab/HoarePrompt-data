Postcondition: **`a[i]` and `b[i]` are elements from arrays `a` and `b` respectively. If `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` is set to the original value of `b[i]` and `b[i]` is set to the original value of `a[i]`, `f` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not less than `b[i]` but `f` is 1, then `f` remains 1 and `a[i]` and `b[i]` keep their original values. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` is set to the original value of `b[i]` and `b[i]` is set to the original value of `a[i]`, `f` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
