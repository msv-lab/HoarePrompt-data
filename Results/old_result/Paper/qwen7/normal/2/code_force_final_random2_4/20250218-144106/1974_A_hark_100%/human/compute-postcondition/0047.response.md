Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is 1. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 <= 0` else the ceiling value of `(x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15`. If `x == 0` and `y > 0`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
