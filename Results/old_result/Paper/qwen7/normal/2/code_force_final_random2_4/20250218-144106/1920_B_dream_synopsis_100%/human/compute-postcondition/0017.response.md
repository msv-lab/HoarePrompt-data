Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[0]`; `ans` contains the value of `sums + a[0]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `k`, `i + x - 1`, and `sums + a[0]` remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
