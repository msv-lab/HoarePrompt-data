The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it generates a random permutation of the string `s` and checks if the original string `s` is different from the permuted string `s2`. If they are different, it prints 'Yes' followed by the permuted string `s2`; otherwise, it prints 'No'. This process is repeated for all provided test cases.
