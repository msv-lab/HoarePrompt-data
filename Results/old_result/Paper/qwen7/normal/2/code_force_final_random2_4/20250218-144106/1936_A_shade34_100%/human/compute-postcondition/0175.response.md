Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. The variable `mak` is not defined in the initial state, and no value for `mak` is provided. Since no value for `mak` is given, we cannot determine its specific value, but it will be printed as is.

Given this, the print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the value of `mak` twice, and then the value of `i` twice.

Output: **'? mak mak 1 1'**
