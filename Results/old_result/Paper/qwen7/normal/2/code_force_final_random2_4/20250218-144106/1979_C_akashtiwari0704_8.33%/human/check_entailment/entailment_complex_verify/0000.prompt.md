You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

    #State: After all iterations, `bets` is equal to the total number of iterations in the loop, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets-1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by each element in `a` for all iterations, and `ans` is a string containing the final values of `a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of cases, then for each case, it reads another positive integer `bets` and a list of `bets` positive integers. It calculates the product of all elements in the list, divides this product by each element in the list, sums these divisions, and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the original product. If true, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it constructs a string of the modified list elements separated by spaces and prints this string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program calculates the product of all multipliers (`k_i` values) and then divides this product by each individual `k_i` value to determine the bets. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total bet amount will be strictly less than the total winnings for any winning outcome.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
5 5 5
```

The program will calculate the product as `5 * 5 * 5 = 125`. Then, it will divide this product by each `k_i` value to get the bets:

- For the first outcome: `125 // 5 = 25`
- For the second outcome: `125 // 5 = 25`
- For the third outcome: `125 // 5 = 25`

The total bet amount is `25 + 25 + 25 = 75`. However, if the first outcome wins, the player receives `5 * 25 = 125` coins, which is not strictly greater than `75`.

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirement that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
