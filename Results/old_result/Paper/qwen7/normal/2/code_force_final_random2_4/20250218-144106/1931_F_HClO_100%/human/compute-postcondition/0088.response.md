Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `idx1` is either `i` (if the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` is true) or remains unchanged (if the condition is false), `idx2` is either unchanged (if the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` is true) or becomes `i` (if the condition is false), `p1` is either 1 (if the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` is true) or remains unchanged (if the condition is false), `p2` is either 1 (if the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` is false) or remains unchanged (if the condition is true), `a1` remains unchanged regardless of the condition, and `a2` remains unchanged regardless of the condition.
