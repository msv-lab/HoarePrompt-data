Output State: **`w` is 1000000000.0, `x` is 3000000000.0, `y` is 4000000000.0, `z` is 5000000000.0, `v` is 1000000000.0, `b` is `[2000000000.0, 3000000000.0, 6000000000.0]`**

Explanation: The code `b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` modifies the list `b`. Here, `b[-2]` refers to the second last element of `b`, which is `3000000000.0`, and `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is `1000000000.0`. 

- For the first part of the addition, `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`: 
  - `v > x - w` evaluates to `False` because `1000000000.0 > 3000000000.0 - 1000000000.0` is `False`.
  - So, `v ** (v > x - w)` is `1000000000.0 ** False`, which is `1000000000.0 ** 0`, resulting in `1.0`.
  - Thus, `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)` is `3000000000.0 + 1.0`, resulting in `3000000001.0`.

- For the second part of the addition, `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`: 
  - `v > z - y` evaluates to `False` because `1000000000.0 > 5000000000.0 - 4000000000.0` is `False`.
  - So, `v ** (v > z - y)` is `1000000000.0 ** False`, which is `1000000000.0 ** 0`, resulting in `1.0`.
  - Thus, `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` is `1000000000.0 + 1.0`, resulting in `1000000001.0`.

Therefore, `b` is updated to include these new values, making `b` equal to `[2000000000.0, 3000000000.0, 6000000000.0]`.
