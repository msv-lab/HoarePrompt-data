Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `no`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `no`.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**: The postcondition states that if `i` is a value that is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to the list `no` and the value of `num` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **Variable `i`**: Since `i` is taken from the list `no`, it will change with each iteration.
   - **List `no`**: The list `no` may change if an element `i` satisfies the condition mentioned in the postcondition.
   - **Variable `num`**: The variable `num` may change if an element `i` satisfies the condition mentioned in the postcondition.

5. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2.
   - `num` is some integer value (not specified, but it could have changed based on previous iterations).

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `no` must still contain at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2.
   - `num` will remain unchanged unless the current `i` satisfies the condition to decrease `num` by 1.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration are:

- `no` must still contain at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2.
- `num` remains unchanged unless the current `i` satisfies the condition to decrease `num` by 1.

Since the exact values of `no` and `num` are not specified, we can only ensure that `no` maintains its property and `num` remains unchanged.

**State:**
- `no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2.
- `num` remains unchanged.

However, to provide a concrete state, let's assume the following for illustration purposes:
- `no` contains at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2 (e.g., `[3]`).
- `num` remains unchanged (e.g., `num` is still 5).

**State:**
- `no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2 (e.g., `[3]`).
- `num` is 5 (or whatever the initial value was before the loop started).

Thus, the final state for the next iteration would be:

**State: **`no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is unchanged.**
