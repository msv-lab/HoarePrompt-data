Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `r` is an input string, `prev` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 3) to `prev`. The values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev` are updated accordingly, but the conditions and values of `n` and `r` remain unchanged.
