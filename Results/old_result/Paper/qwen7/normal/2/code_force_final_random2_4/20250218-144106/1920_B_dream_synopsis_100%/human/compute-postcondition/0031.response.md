Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `k` is at least 1. If `i` equals 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `ans` is a list containing the updated `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`, and `ans` is a list containing the updated `sums + a[0]`.
