Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` and `v` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers. If `u` is equal to the first element of the list `tree`, then `v` is appended to the left end of `tree`. If `u` is not equal to the first element of the list `tree`, then no change occurs to `i`, `n`, `u`, `v`, and `tree`.
