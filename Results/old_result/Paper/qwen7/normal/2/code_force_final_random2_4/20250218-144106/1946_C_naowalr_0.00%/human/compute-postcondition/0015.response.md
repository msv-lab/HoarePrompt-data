Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is 2, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, b, a]`, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b, a, b]`**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[a, b]`. After appending `a`, `adj[b]` becomes `[a, b, a]`. The values of other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
