Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `input()`, which is used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on the input provided.
   - If the input is `n`, then the loop will run `n` times.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - The state `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - The state `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1 because each iteration consumes one unit of `n`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` minus 1.**
