Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the logic of purchasing tickets and updating the prices for subsequent days. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a given day.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2 3
8 6 4
```

The correct approach would be:
- On day 1, buy 2 tickets for a total of 16 (8 * 2). The prices for the next day would be [10, 4].
- On day 2, buy 1 ticket for a total of 4 (4 * 1).

The total cost should be 20, but the program calculates the cost as follows:
- It sorts the list to [4, 6, 8].
- It then iterates through the list, buying the minimum of `m` or `k` tickets each day and updating the cost accordingly.

However, the program does not correctly update the prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased on the current day. This leads to incorrect calculations and thus the program is not correct for this problem.
