Output State: **`i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `max(1, yb - x)` to the variable `l`. Since `x` is already defined as the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, `l` will take the value of `yb - x` if `yb - x` is greater than 1, otherwise it will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
