Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
3. It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
4. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
5. It iterates over the difficulty levels 'A' to 'F' (stored in `p`).
6. For each difficulty level, it checks if the required number of problems `m` exceeds the count of problems of that difficulty in `s`.
7. If there are fewer problems of a certain difficulty than `m`, it adds the difference `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans`.
8. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps described, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can hold `m` rounds with at least one problem of each required difficulty level.

Correctness: **True**
