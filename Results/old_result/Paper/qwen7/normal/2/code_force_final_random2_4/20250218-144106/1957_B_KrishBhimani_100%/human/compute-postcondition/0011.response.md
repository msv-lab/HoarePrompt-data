Output State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `l1`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
