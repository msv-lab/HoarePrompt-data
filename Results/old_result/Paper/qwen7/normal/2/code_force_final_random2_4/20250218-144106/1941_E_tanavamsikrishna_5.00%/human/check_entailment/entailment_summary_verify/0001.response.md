### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic in both `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's break down the key points and verify the correctness of the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function processes a single row to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports under the given constraints.
   - It correctly handles the edge case where `i < d - 1` by simply adding 1 to the current depth.
   - For `i >= d - 1`, it uses dynamic programming to ensure that the distance constraint is respected. Specifically, it considers the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells plus the current depth plus 1.
   - The final result returned is the total cost for that row, which is correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` for each test case.
   - It then reads `n` rows of depths and processes each row using `func_1`.
   - It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs obtained from `func_1` for those rows.
   - It finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.
   - The final step of printing the minimum total cost is correct.

Given the detailed analysis and the function summaries provided, there are no logical errors or inefficiencies in the program. The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.
