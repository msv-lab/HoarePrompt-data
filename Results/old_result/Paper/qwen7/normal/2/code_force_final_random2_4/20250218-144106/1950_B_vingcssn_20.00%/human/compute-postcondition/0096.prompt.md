You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')
        
    #State: Output State: `casos` is decremented by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0, `c` equals `casos` after all iterations, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), and `n` is an integer input for each iteration from the user. After all iterations, the loop will have printed patterns based on the value of `n` for each iteration, and `casos` will be 0.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `casos` will be 0 (since it starts as an input integer between 1 and 20 and is decremented by 1 each time through the loop), `c` will equal the original value of `casos` (as it is incremented once per iteration), `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop, and `n` represents the integer inputs provided by the user for each iteration of the loop. The loop will have printed the corresponding patterns based on the value of `n` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two integers, t and n, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. It returns either an error message if t or n is out of the specified range or a result based on the values of t and n.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
