Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list with at least one element containing the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is set to `1` if `d.get(i)` was `None`, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by `1`, where `i` is the first element of `palka`.

This postcondition summarizes that if `i` (the first element of `palka`) is not already in `pl`, then `pl` will contain `i` appended to it, and `d[i]` will be updated according to the rules specified in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change outside of appending `i` to `pl` and updating `d[i]`.
