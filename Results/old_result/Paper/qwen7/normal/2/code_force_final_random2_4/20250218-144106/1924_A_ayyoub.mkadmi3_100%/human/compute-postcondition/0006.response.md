Output State: **`i` is not in the alphabet, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and the current length of the alphabet is `k-1`.**

Explanation: The code removes the character `i` from the alphabet. Since `i` was originally in the alphabet, it is no longer part of it. The string `s` and its length `m` remain unchanged, as well as the fact that `s` consists of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The length of the alphabet is reduced by one because `i` has been removed.
