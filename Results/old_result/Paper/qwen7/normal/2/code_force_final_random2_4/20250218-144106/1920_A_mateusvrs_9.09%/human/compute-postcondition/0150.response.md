Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.**

Explanation: The code `bx = max(x, bx)` assigns to `bx` the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`. Since `bx` was not defined before, it defaults to `x` (as `max(x, None)` would return `x`). Therefore, `bx` now holds the maximum of `x` and the original value of `x`, which is `x` itself. The conditions and values of `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
