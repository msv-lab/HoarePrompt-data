State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` depends on the variable `t`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`, and `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once.
3. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is within the specified range.

Hence, the state to be adjusted is that `t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
