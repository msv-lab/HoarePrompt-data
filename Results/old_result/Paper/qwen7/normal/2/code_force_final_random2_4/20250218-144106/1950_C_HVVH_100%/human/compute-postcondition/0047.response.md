Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer, `day` is assigned the value according to whether `h` equals 12 or not. If `h` equals 12, `day` is set to 'PM'; otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.
