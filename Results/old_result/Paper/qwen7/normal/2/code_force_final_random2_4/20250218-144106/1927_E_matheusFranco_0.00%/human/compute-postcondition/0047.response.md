Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` to `curr_v`. Since `curr_v` was previously `curr_v + 1`, after the assignment, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` becomes `curr_v + 1`. Additionally, `curr_v` itself is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
