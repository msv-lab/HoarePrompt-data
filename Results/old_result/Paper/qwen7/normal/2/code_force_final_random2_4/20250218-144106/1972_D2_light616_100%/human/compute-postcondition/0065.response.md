Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is greater than or equal to 5.
- `y` is 5.
- `n` is at least 10.
- `m` is at least 20.
- `cnt` is 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(cnt)
```

Given that `cnt` is explicitly stated to be 1 and no operations are performed on `cnt` within the code snippet provided, the value of `cnt` remains unchanged.

Output: **1**
