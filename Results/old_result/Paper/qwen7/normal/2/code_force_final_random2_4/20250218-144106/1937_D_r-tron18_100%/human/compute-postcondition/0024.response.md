Output State: **`el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is shortened by removing the last element, `ans[i]` is calculated as follows: if `ol <= zr`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.**

Explanation: The value of `totalOne` is decremented by 1, changing its value to `totalOne - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
