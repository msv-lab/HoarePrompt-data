Output State: **`index` is 6 + `data[5]`, `n` is an integer value equal to `data[index]`, `t` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + data[index] - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` appended with `result`, and `results.append(result)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The line `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was set to `5 + data[index] + data[index]`, which simplifies to `5 + 2 * data[index]`. After incrementing, `index` becomes `6 + data[index]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
