Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `unique_a` is a set containing elements from `a`, `results` list now contains 'YES', `unique_b` is a set containing elements from `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`.**

Explanation: The code updates the set `only_b` by subtracting the set `relevant_a` from the set `relevant_b`. This means `only_b` now contains elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
