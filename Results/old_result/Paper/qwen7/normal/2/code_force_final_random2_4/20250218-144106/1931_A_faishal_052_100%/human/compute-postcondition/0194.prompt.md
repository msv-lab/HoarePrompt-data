You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `arr` will contain the elements `[1, 26, 26, lex - 2]` or `[1, 26, 26, lex - 27]`, depending on the value of `lex` after the last iteration, and `arr` will be sorted in ascending order. `info` will be a list containing the final state of `arr` after sorting for each iteration.
    #
    #This means that for each case (`i` in `range(cases)`), the loop constructs an array `arr` based on the value of `lex`, appends `lex` to `arr`, sorts `arr`, and then adds it to the `info` list. After all cases have been processed, `info` will contain a list of lists, where each inner list represents the final state of `arr` for each respective case, sorted in ascending order.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)` repeated three times, and `info` contains a list of lists where each inner list represents the final state of `arr` after sorting for each respective case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer n where 3 <= n <= 78, given that for each test case, t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
