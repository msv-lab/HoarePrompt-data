Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no' appended, and either 'no' or 'yes' appended, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
