Postcondition: **`current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` remains 0, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. If the `combined` list is not empty, the `current_profit` and `max_profit` remain 0, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold regardless of whether the if condition is true or false.
