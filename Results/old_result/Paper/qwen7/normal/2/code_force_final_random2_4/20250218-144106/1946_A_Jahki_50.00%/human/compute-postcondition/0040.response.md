Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, where `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`, and `op` is 3. The list `b` is sorted and each element at index `ma` has been incremented 3 times during the loop iterations.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `op` will be 3, indicating that the loop executed 3 times. The list `b` remains sorted, but the value at the index `ma` (which is `num2 / 2`) has been incremented 3 times, affecting the `new_median` value.
