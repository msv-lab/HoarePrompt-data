Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
3. It first checks if the entire array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])`.
4. If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' immediately.
5. If the array is not sorted, it iterates through the array to find a subarray starting from index 1 that can be swapped with the prefix to make the entire array non-decreasing.
6. For each potential split point `i`, it checks if the subarray `a[i:]` can be placed before the prefix `a[:i]` to form a non-decreasing sequence. This involves checking two conditions:
   - `check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`: This checks if the first element of the original array can be greater than or equal to every element in the subarray.
   - `new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This checks if the subarray itself is non-decreasing.
7. If either condition fails for any split point, the function prints 'NO'.
8. If a valid split point is found, the function prints 'YES'.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the annotated program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
