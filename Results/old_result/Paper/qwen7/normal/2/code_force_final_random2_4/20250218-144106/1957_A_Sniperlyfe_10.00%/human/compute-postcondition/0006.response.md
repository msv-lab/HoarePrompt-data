Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element, `n` is the second element in the list, `freq` is a dictionary where the key is `n` and the value is the frequency of `n` in `arr` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency of `n` in the dictionary `freq`. Since `n` is the second element in the list `arr`, the frequency of `n` in `freq` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `freq[n]` is the original frequency of `n` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
