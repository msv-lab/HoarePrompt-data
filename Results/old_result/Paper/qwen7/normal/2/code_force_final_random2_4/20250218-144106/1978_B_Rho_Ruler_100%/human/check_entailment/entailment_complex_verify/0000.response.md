### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function calculates the profit when selling the first `k` buns at a modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`. The formula used is:
\[ \text{Profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

- **Correctness**: The formula is correct. It accounts for the modified price of the first `k` buns and the usual price of the remaining buns. The term \(- \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2}\) ensures that the price decreases linearly from `b` to `b - k + 1`.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.

- **Initial State**: `low = 0` and `high = min(n, b)`.
- **Loop Invariant**: The loop invariant is maintained because the binary search correctly narrows down the range `[low, high]` to find the optimal `k`.
- **Midpoint Calculation**: `mid = (low + high) // 2` calculates the midpoint of the current range.
- **Profit Calculation**: `profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` calculate the profits for `mid` and `mid + 1` respectively.
- **Update Bounds**: If `profit_next > profit_mid`, then the optimal `k` must be greater than `mid`, so `low = mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high = mid - 1`.

The loop continues until `low > high`, and `max_profit` stores the highest profit found during the iterations.

- **Final State**: `low` is the final lower bound where the maximum profit is found, and `high` is the final upper bound which is either `low` or one step above it. `max_profit` holds the highest profit found.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the binary search approach ensures that the maximum possible profit is always determined. The function correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases like `k = 0` or `k = min(n, b)`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
