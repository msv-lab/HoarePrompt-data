Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 2, otherwise `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates `one_perc` to the value of `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `o` and `one`, and since `i` is 2, `n - i - 1` would be `n - 3`. Given the conditions for `zero` and `one`, we know `o` and `one` are both 2. Thus, `o - one` is 0, making `one_perc` equal to `math.ceil(0 * 100 / (n - 3))`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
