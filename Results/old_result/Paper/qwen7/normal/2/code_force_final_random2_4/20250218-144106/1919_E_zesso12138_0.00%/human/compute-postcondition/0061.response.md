Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length `2 * n + 1`, `j` is 0, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`**.

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Given the initial state, `j` is 0, so `j - 1` is -1. Since list indices cannot be negative, this line does not actually modify `new_dp` because there is no element at index -1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the updated condition for `new_dp[j - 1]`, which is now `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
