Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of '1's in the string `s` and assigns the count to `cnt1`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
