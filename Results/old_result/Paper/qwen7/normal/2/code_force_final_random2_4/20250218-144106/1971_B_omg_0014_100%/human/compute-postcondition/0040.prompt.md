Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the size of the set `a` is 1, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `a` has more than one unique character, `b` is either equal to the sorted version of `s` or not equal to it, and `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters of `s`, `b` is the sorted version of `s`, and `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters of `s`, `b` is the sorted version of `s`, and `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. Regardless of whether the condition `len(a) == 1` is true or false, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
