### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the program. However, there are a few points that need careful consideration:

1. **Construction of the Progressive Square:**
   - The program constructs the list `li` by iterating over all possible pairs `(k, h)` within the range `[0, n-1]`. This is correct because it ensures that all elements in the progressive square are generated.
   - The formula `a + k * c + d * h` is used to generate each element in the progressive square, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - The program sorts both `li` and `l` before comparing them. This is necessary because the order of elements in the progressive square must match the order in the provided list `l`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the construction and sorting of the lists correctly.
   - It checks if the sorted list `l` matches the generated list `li`, which should contain all elements of the progressive square in sorted order.

4. **Functionality:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly generates the progressive square and checks if the provided list `l` matches this square.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations provided, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately implements the logic to check if the provided list `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.
