Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism, and `s` is assigned the value of the input string**.

The code `s = input()` takes the input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
