Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(100 / (n - 1))**.

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
