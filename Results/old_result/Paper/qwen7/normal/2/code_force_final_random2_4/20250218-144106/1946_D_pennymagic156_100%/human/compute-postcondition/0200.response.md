Postcondition: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 27, `u` is `(a[0] >> 27 & 1)`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]`. If `v` is odd, `t` remains empty, `ans` remains either -1 or 0, `i` remains 27, `u` remains `(a[0] >> 27 & 1)`, and `v` remains the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]`. If `v` is even, `t` remains empty, `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and the count of times `op` becomes 0 during the loop, `i` remains 27, `u` remains `(a[0] >> 27 & 1)`, and `v` remains the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]`.**
