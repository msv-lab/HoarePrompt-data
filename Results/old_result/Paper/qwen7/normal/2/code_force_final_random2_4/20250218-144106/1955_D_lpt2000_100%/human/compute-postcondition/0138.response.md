Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split by spaces; `aa` is a list of strings where each string is an element from the input split by spaces; `bb` is a list of strings from the new input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a new input, splits it into elements, and converts each element to a string before adding it to the list `bb`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `aa` retains its original list of strings. The new input is processed to create the list `bb`.
