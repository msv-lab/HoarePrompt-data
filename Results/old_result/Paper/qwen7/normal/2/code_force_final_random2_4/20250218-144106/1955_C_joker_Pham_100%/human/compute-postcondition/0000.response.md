Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1.**

The code initializes two new variables, `l` and `r`, with the values `0` and `n - 1` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
