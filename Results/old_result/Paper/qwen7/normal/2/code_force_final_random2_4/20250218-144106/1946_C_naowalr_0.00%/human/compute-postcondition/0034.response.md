Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` again, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` simply reassigns the value of `leftover` to be the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)`. Since `leftover` was already the result of `dfs(1, 1)` before this line of code, it remains unchanged. The other variables, `numCuts` and `x`, are not affected by this line of code.
