Output State: **`p2` is 1, `idx2` is `i + 1` and `p2` is 1, or `idx2` is `i + 1` and `p2` is 1, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `p2 = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `p2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `p2` being set to 1, while the conditions involving `idx2` and `p2` remain the same as before.
