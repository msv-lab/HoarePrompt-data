Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain in their initial state, which in this case is undefined since no other variables were mentioned in the initial state. The only affected variable is `n`, which now holds the integer value of the input provided by the user.
