Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]` if no swap was made during the last iteration, and `arr[i]` is unchanged or adjusted according to the loop conditions, `ans` is `False` if any swap was made during the iterations that caused `nums` to be unsorted, otherwise, it remains `True` if no such condition was met.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes the input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. The values of `i`, `m`, `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i]`, and `ans` remain as per their initial conditions unless specified by the new assignment. Since no specific swap or sorting operation is performed in this line of code, the conditions related to `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i]`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
