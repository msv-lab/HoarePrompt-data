Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `index` is increased by 32, `path` is the value of `data[index]`, `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `n` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` converts the value of `data[index]` to an integer and assigns it to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. `t` is still greater than 0 (since it was initially greater than 1 and was only decreased by 1), `index` is increased by 32, `path` remains as the value of `data[index]`, `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`, and `n` is now the integer value of `data[index]`.
