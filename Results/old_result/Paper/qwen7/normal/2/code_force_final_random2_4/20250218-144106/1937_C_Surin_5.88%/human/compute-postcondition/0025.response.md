Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3
- `v2` is 3
- `r` must be unchanged, but `r` is not used in the print statement
- `v1` must be unchanged, but `v1` is not used in the print statement

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This will print the string `'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}'` with the placeholders `{v1}` and `{v2}` replaced by their respective values. Since `v1` and `v2` are unchanged from their initial states, `v1` is 3 and `v2` is 3.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 3 3 3 3'**
