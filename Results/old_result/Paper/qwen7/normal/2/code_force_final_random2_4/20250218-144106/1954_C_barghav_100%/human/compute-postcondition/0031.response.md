Postcondition: `a[i]` and `b[i]` are elements from arrays `a` and `b` respectively. If `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` is set to the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i]` is set to the original value of `a[i]`, and `f` is set to 1. If `a[i]` is not less than `b[i]`, `f` retains its original value.
