Output State: **`t` is a non-empty value decreased by the total number of iterations of the loop, `r()` has been called twice, `a` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `b` is [0, 0, v, 2v, 4v], `u` is at least 1 and decreased by 1, `c` is the first return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()` and is at least 1, `c` and `d` are updated to the return values of `r()`**.

This means that the function `r()` was called again, and it returned two values which were assigned to `c` and `d`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `u`, and the fact that `r()` has been called twice remain unchanged from the initial state.
