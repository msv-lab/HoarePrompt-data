Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is 2, `t` is an integer from the list `data`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    s = data[index]
    index += 1
    num_up_coins = s.count('U')
    if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `index` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is equal to the length of `data[3]`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', and `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' in `data[3]`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` contains 'YES'. If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `index` is 7, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is data[5], `s` is data[6], `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' in `s.count('U')`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` is a list containing 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `index` is 9, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is data[7], `s` is data[8], `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` is updated to contain 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` is updated to contain 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
