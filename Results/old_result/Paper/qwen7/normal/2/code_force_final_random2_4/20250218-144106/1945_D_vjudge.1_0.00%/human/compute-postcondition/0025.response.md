Output State: **`soma_b` is increased by `pref + lista_A[i]`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `m + 2` where `m` is the current value of `i` from the previous iteration and `m + 2 < n - k`**.

Explanation: The code `pref += lista_A[i]` updates the value of `pref` by adding `lista_A[i]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is updated to `m + 2`, and the conditions on `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, and `pref` remain the same as before.
