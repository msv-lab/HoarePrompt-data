Output State: **`y` is `n - 1 - ii`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is equal to `a[ii] + k // (ii + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (ii + 1)`, and the value of `(ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii])` is greater than `k`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `y` to `n - 1 - ii`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
