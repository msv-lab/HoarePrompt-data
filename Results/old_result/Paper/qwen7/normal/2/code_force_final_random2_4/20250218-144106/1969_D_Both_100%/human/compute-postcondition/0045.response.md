Postcondition: `current_profit` is updated such that if `removed_item[0] + removed_item[1] >= 0`, it is decreased by `removed_item[1]`, otherwise it is increased by `removed_item[0]`; `heap` is modified by pushing `removed_item` and popping the smallest element; `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order with the last item popped; `removed_item` is true; `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.
