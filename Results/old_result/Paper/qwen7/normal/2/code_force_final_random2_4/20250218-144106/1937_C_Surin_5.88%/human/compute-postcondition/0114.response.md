Output State: **i is n, n is an integer greater than 4, r is an input string, and prev remains unchanged (still 0) unless '>', was entered for any i from 1 to n-1, in which case prev would be set to the last i where '>' was entered.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `r` is an input string that could have been read during the loop but remains undefined here since we don't know the specific inputs.
- The variable `prev` will be 0 unless the user entered '>' for any value of `i` from 1 to `n-1`, in which case `prev` will be set to the last `i` where '>' was entered.
