Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `k` is the second integer input.
   - `num_iterations` must be greater than 0.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `num_iterations` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `int(input())` was indeed greater than 0, and the loop continued.
   - The next value of `int(input())` must also be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `num_iterations` will decrease by 1 because one iteration of the loop has just completed.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `num_iterations` is now 1 less than its previous value, but still greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `num_iterations` must be greater than 0 (decreased by 1)**.
