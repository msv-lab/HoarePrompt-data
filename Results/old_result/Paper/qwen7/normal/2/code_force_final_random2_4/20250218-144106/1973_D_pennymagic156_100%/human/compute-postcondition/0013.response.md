Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `v` to be the return value of `func_2()`. Since no specific value or behavior of `func_2()` is given, `v` now holds whatever `func_2()` returns. The values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
