Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in palka:`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the `palka` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of `palka`**: According to the given information, `palka` is updated to a list of integers based on user input. However, we need to ensure that `palka` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `palka`, `palka` must contain at least one integer for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`shapes`, `d`, `pl`, `w`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `palka` must contain at least one integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`palka` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer**
