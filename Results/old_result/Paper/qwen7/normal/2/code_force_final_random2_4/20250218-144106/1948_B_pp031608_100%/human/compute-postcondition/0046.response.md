Output State: **`i` is between 1 and `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the previous value `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code converts the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` into a list of integers and appends the integer value of `arr[i]` to it. The conditions regarding the range of `i` and the comparison between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
