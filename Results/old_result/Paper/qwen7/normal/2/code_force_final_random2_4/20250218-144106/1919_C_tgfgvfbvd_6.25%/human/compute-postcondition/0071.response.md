Postcondition: `n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, and `x` is `n + 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is the value at index `x` of list `l`.
