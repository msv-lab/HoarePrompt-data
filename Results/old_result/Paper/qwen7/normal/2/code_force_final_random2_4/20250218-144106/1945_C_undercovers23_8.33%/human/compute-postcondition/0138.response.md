Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `lst` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
   - `ele` is `ele`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `lst`, at the end of each iteration, `ele` will be set to the next element in `lst`.
   - The variable `mini` is updated based on the current value of `ele`, but it does not need to be explicitly stated in the new state since it is an internal update and not part of the loop head.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `mini` remains unchanged from the previous state.
   - `ele` is now set to the next element in `lst`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in `lst`**.
