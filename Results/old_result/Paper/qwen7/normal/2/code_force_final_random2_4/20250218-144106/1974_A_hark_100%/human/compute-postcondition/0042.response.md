Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is an input integer that must be greater than 1.
- `k` is 1.
- `x` is an input integer from the first input split.
- `y` is an input integer from the second input split.

The `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of the division of `y` by 2. 

Since the exact value of `y` is not specified, we will describe the output in terms of `y`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2)**
