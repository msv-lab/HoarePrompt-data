Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `idx2` is now equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. Since `i` was already incremented in the previous line, `idx2` now holds the value of `i`. All other variables (`idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`, `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
