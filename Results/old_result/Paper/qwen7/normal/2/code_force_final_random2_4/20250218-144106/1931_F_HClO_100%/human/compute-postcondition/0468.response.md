Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts them to integers, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. The `val` list is updated to contain the new values of `a3` and `l3`.
