Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(a))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `a` and `b` are strings
   - `i` is 0
   - `f` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. Since `i` starts at 0, it will increment by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from 0 to 1.
   - The value of `a` does not change within the loop head.
   - The variable `f` is not involved in the loop head and its value remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1
- `a` and `b` are still strings
- `f` is still 0

So, the final state is:
State: **`a` and `b` are strings, `i` is 1, `f` is 0**
