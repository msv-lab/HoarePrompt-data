Output State: **`current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` remains 0, `heap` contains the second tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` must be greater than 1, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops the last tuple from `combined` and pushes it into the `heap`. This operation changes the content of the `heap` but does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the other variables remain in their initial states except for the `heap` which now contains the second tuple from `combined`.
