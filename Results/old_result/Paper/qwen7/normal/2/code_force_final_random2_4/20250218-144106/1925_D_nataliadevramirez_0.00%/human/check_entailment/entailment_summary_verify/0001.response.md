### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
- Each time a friendship pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1.
- The final answer should be in the form of \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers, and we need to compute \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

#### Function Summaries Recap
- `func_1` computes the expected value for a single test case.
- `func_2` processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each and printing the results.

#### Detailed Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the expected value for a single test case.
   - It uses the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` to compute the sum of the first `k` natural numbers.
   - It multiplies this sum by the friendship value `f` for each friendship pair.
   - The result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the list of friendships.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.

### Verification of Correctness
- **Sum of First `k` Natural Numbers**: 
  - The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` is correct and used appropriately.
  
- **Friendship Value Calculation**:
  - The program correctly multiplies the friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers.
  - This accounts for the cumulative increase in friendship value due to repeated selections.
  
- **Modulo Operation**:
  - The result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers, which is correct.
  
- **Input Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and reads the necessary inputs for each test case.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It accurately calculates the expected sum of friendship values and handles the modulo operation appropriately.

### Final Answer
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
