### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The task is to build \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
- Each bridge requires supports to be installed in certain cells.
- The cost of installing a support in cell \((i, j)\) is \(a_{i, j} + 1\).
- Supports must be installed in the first and last columns of each row.
- The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\).

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- This function calculates the cost of installing supports in a single row.
- It ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than \(d\).
- The function uses a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost for placing supports in the row.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of `func_1`:
1. Initialize the cost of the first support as \(a_{i, 1} + 1\).
2. For each subsequent cell \(j\) (starting from \(d-1\)), the cost is calculated as the minimum cost of the previous \(d\) cells plus the cost of the current cell plus 1.
3. The final cost is the cost of the last support in the row.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- This function processes the entire grid and calculates the minimum total cost for building \(k\) bridges on consecutive rows.
- It iterates through each possible starting row for the bridges and calculates the total cost for each subsequence of length \(k\).
- The minimum total cost among all subsequences is printed.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to place supports in a single row while ensuring the distance constraint.
- The function `func_2` correctly iterates through all possible subsequences of length \(k\) and calculates the total cost for each subsequence.
- The overall approach of the program is sound and should correctly compute the minimum total cost.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the function summaries. The original assessment incorrectly identified an issue with the program's correctness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and function summaries.
