Postcondition: `i` must be less than or equal to 1000, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'. If `x < y` and `y > z`, then `res` is 'peak'. If `x < y` and `y < z`, then `res` is 'stair'. If `x < y` and neither condition for 'peak' nor 'stair' is met, then `res` is 'none'. If `x >= y`, then `res` is set to 'none'.
