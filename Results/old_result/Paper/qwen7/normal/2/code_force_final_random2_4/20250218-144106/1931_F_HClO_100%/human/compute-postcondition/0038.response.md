Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, or `n`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values.
