Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `n` and the object `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. The variable `n` takes the value of each element in the list during each iteration.

3. **Determine the Initial State Adjustments**: Since the loop will iterate over each element in `arr`, the initial state should reflect that the loop can start executing. This means `arr` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `arr` must be a non-empty list because the loop will iterate over its elements.
   - `n` will take the value of the first element in `arr` during the first iteration of the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must be a non-empty list.
- `n` must be set to the value of the first element in `arr`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the first element in the list**.
