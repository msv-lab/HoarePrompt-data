Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and between 1 and 500, `i` is 3, `s` is a string with more than one character and its length is greater than 7, `count` is 4, `flag` is True, `j` is 9.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if statement. Since the else part is not provided and there is no change in the variables outside the if block, the postcondition remains the same as the if part's postcondition.
