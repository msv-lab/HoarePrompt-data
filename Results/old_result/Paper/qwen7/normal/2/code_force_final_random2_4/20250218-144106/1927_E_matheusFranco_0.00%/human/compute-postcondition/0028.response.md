Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1 + 1`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3`, and `i` is less than `len(permutation)`**

Explanation: 
- The variable `curr_v` was originally defined as the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 2`.
- After executing `curr_v += 1`, `curr_v` is now updated to be the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3`.
- All other variables (`multiples_of_k_plus_i`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]`, and `i`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
