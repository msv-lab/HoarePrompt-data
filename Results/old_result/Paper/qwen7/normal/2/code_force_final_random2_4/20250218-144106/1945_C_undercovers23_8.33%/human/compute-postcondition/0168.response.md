To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **mini**: This is the minimum value between its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. Without knowing the specific values of `pk` and `lst`, we cannot determine the exact value of `mini`.

2. **ele**: This is explicitly stated to be 5.

3. **final**: This contains all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`, and it is sorted. Again, without knowing the specific values of `pk` and `lst`, we cannot determine the exact contents of `final`.

4. **c1**: This is calculated as `o * 100 // n`. Without knowing the values of `o` and `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `c1`.

5. **final** (second part): If `len(final)` is 0, then `final` will contain either `[0]` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or it will include the value of `n` otherwise.

Given these points, let's consider the possible scenarios for `final`:

- If `len(final)` is not 0, `final` would contain elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`. Since the exact values of `pk` and `lst` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact elements in `final`.

- If `len(final)` is 0, `final` will contain either `[0]` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or it will include the value of `n` otherwise.

Since the exact values of `o`, `n`, `pk`, and `lst` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `c1` or the exact elements in `final`. However, we know that `final` will be either empty or will contain `[0]` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or it will contain `n` otherwise.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `c1`:

- If `c1 >= 50`, `final` will be `[0]`, and the print statement will output `0`.
- If `c1 < 50`, `final` will be `[n]`, and the print statement will output `n`.

Since we do not have the exact values, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the conditions given.

Output: **0 or [n]**
