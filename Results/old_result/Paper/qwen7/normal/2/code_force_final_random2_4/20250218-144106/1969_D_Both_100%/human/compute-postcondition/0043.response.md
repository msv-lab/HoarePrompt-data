Postcondition: `current_profit` is updated based on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`; if `removed_item` is true, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`, otherwise `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`. `heap` is modified by pushing `item` and popping the smallest element. `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order with the last item popped.
