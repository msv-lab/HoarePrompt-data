Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `both` is a set containing elements that are common to `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   - `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` in each tuple of `cases`.
   - `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from list `a` in each tuple of `cases`.
   - `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` where each element is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` where each element is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`.
   - `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`.
   - `results` is a list with at least two additional elements 'NO' and 'YES' is appended to the results list.

3. **Understand the loop execution condition**: The loop will iterate over each tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` in `cases`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` in `cases`, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` will change for each iteration.
   - The sets `both`, `unique_b`, `unique_a`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, and `only_b` and the list `results` will be updated based on the current values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, the loop will use the next tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` from `cases`.
   - Therefore, the states of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` will change to the next tuple.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` from `cases`.

**State: **`both` is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list b in the next tuple of cases, `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from list a in the next tuple of cases, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` where each element is less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` where each element is less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `results` is a list with at least two additional elements 'NO' and 'YES' is appended to the results list.**
