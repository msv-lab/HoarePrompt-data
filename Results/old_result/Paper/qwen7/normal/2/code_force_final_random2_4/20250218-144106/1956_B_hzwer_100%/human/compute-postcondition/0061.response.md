Output State: **`cnt` is [1, 2, 0], `ans` is 8, `a` is a list of integers that contains exactly two integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = 0` does not affect the values of `cnt`, `ans`, or `a`. The value of `ans` remains 8, `cnt` remains [1, 2, 0], and `a` is still a list of exactly two integers. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
