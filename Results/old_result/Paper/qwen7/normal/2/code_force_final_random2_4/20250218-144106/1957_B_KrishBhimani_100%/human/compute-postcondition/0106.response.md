Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting a new input string.
   - `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer.
   - `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `i` is the final value determined by the loop (either the number of times the loop executed or one less than that).
   - `ans` is a list containing `(1 << i) - 1`.
   - `temp` is 2 if `temp * 2 >= k` after the last iteration of the loop, otherwise `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - `ans` now contains `k - sum(ans)`.
   - `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```
   This line prints the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

3. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` starts with `(1 << i) - 1`, where `i` is the number of iterations of the loop.
   - After the loop, `ans` is adjusted to contain `k - sum(ans)`.
   - Finally, `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`.

Given these steps, let's assume a specific example to illustrate the process. Suppose the input string is "3 5" and the next input is "4". This means `n = 3`, `k = 5`, and the number of iterations left is `4 - 2 = 2`.

- For `i = 2` (number of iterations):
  - `ans` starts as `(1 << 2) - 1 = 3`.
  - After the loop, `ans` becomes `5 - 3 = 2`.
  - Extending `ans` by `[0] * (3 - 1) = [0, 0]`, so `ans` becomes `[3, 0, 0]`.

Thus, the final `ans` is `[3, 0, 0]`.

Output: **3 0 0**
