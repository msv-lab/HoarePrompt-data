Output State: **`start` is an input integer, `i` is `start-1`, the deque `tree` is empty, `idx` is an error because `tree` is empty.**

Explanation: The code attempts to find the index of `start` in the deque `tree`. Since `tree` is empty, calling `tree.index(start)` will raise a `ValueError`, indicating that `start` is not found in an empty list. Therefore, `idx` is not assigned a valid index and remains in an error state due to the empty `tree`.
