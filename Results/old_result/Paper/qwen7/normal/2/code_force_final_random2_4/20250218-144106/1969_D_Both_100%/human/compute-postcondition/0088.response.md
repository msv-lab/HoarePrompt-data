Output State: **`current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `combined` is sorted by the second element of each tuple, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

The code sorts the `combined` list based on the second element of each tuple. The sorting is done in ascending order because no reverse parameter is specified in the `sort` method. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
