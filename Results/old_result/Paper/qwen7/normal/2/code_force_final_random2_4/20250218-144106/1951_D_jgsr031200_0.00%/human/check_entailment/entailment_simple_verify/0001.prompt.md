You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `n` is reduced by the sum of all elements in the `costs` list, which is `n - k + 1 + 1 = n - k + 2`. Since `h` is incremented by `curr` in each iteration and `curr` is always equal to `n // i`, which in the last iteration would be `1` (as `n` becomes `k - 1`), `h` will be incremented `n - k + 1` times plus one more time when `n` is `k - 1`, making it equal to `n`. However, since `n` is reduced to `k - 1` by the end of the loop, `h` will be `n - (n - k + 1)`, simplifying to `k - 1`.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from each stall in sequence.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It then calls `func_1(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `1`. This means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she has exactly `k` coins.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This means Alice cannot buy even one jewel if she has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy with the given `n` coins and checks if the sum of these jewels is less than `k`.
     - It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
     - It calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy with each cost and updates `h` (total jewels bought) and `n` (remaining coins).
     - If the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the calculated `costs`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling `n == k` and `n < k` is correct.
   - The logic for calculating the number of jewels Alice can buy with the given costs and checking if the total is at least `k` is also correct.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not handle the case where more than 2 costs are needed to achieve exactly `k` jewels. The problem states that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, but the current implementation only handles up to 2 stalls.

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case (7 3), the program correctly outputs "YES" and the appropriate values.
   - For the second test case (6 4), the program incorrectly outputs "YES" when it should output "NO".
   - For the third test case (255 8), the program correctly outputs "YES" and the appropriate values.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where more than 2 stalls are needed to achieve exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement of setting up at most 60 stalls.

### Correctness:
**False**
