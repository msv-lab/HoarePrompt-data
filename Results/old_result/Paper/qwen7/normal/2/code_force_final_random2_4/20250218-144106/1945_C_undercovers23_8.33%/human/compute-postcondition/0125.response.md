Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 5, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 0, `one` is 1, and `lst` contains the values 3 and 4.**

The code `one += 1` increments the value of the variable `one` by 1. Given the initial state where `one` was not specified, it implies that `one` was 0 before the increment. After the increment, `one` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
