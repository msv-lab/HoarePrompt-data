Output: **1 2 3 ... 1024**

Explanation: The initial state describes that the list `ans` contains all integers from 1 to 1024 (inclusive). When the `print(*ans)` statement is executed, it will print all elements of the list `ans` separated by a single space. Since the list contains integers from 1 to 1024, the output will be the sequence of numbers from 1 to 1024, each separated by a space.
