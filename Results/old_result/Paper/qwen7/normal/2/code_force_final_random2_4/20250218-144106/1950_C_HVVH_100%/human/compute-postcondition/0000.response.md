Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `day` is 'AM'**.

The code simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. This does not affect the value of `t`, which remains an integer within the specified range. Therefore, both `t` and `day` are updated in the output state as described.
