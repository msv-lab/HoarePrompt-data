Output State: **`n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is equal to `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `beautiful_count = 0` initializes the variable `beautiful_count` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `freq` remain unchanged from their initial states.
