Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `required_mod_x`**: The calculation of `required_mod_x` is incorrect. It should be calculated as `(num - mod_x) % x`, not `(x - mod_x) % x`. This is because we need to find a number whose sum with `num` is divisible by `x`.

2. **Misinterpretation of Conditions**: The conditions for a pair to be considered "beautiful" are not correctly implemented. Specifically, the logic for checking if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` is flawed.

3. **Debugging Statements**: The print statements are not necessary for the final solution but can be useful for debugging. However, they should be removed from the final implementation.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            
            # Calculate the required mods for the other element in the pair
            required_mod_x = (num - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = (num + y - mod_y) % y
            
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]
            
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] = 0
            freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] += 1
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

This corrected solution properly implements the conditions for a pair to be considered "beautiful" and calculates the number of such pairs efficiently using frequency counts.
