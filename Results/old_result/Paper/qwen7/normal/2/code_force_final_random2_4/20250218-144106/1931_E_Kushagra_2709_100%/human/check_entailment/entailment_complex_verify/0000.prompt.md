You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, nums):

    tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

#Function 2:

    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        tot += 1
    return tot



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, nums))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of integers in the list, m is an integer determining when Sasha wins, and nums is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will iterate over the range from 0 to the length of `cntvals` with a step of 2 until there are no more elements to process. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to the largest even number less than or equal to the length of `cntvals`, and `tot` will be decreased by the sum of every second element in `cntvals`, starting from the first element.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the largest even number not exceeding the length of `cntvals`, and `tot` will have been reduced by the sum of all elements in `cntvals` at even indices (starting from index 0).
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the variable `tot` is greater than or equal to the value of `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of integers in the list), `m` (an integer determining when Sasha wins), and `nums` (a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). It calculates the total length of the string representations of all integers in `nums`, sorts a list of their zero counts in descending order, and then subtracts the sum of every second element in this sorted list from a cumulative total. Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the resulting total is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        
        tot += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1, `i` is 0, `tot` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in `num`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be set to 0 because the loop decrements `i` from `len(num) - 1` until it finds a non-zero digit or reaches the beginning of the string. The variable `tot` will count the number of trailing zeros in the string `num`. This is because each time the loop encounters a '0', it increments `tot` by 1. Once a non-zero digit is encountered, the loop breaks, and `i` remains as the index of that non-zero digit.
    return tot
    #`The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the integer 'num'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `num` between 1 and 10^9, converts it to a string, and counts the number of trailing zeros. It then returns this count as an integer.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `zerocnts` do not accurately reflect the rules of the game as described.

1. **Function `zerocnts`**: This function counts the trailing zeros in a number. However, it is not used in the main logic of determining the winner, and its presence in the solution is unnecessary and misleading.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to determine the winner based on the total length of the numbers after reversing and the count of trailing zeros. However, the logic inside this function does not align with the game rules. The function sums the lengths of the numbers after reversing and then subtracts the count of trailing zeros. This does not correctly simulate the game's mechanics where Sasha concatenates two numbers and Anna reverses a number.

To correctly determine the winner, we need to consider the parity of the number of elements in the list and the maximum value of the numbers. Here is a corrected approach:

```python
def determine_winner(n, m, nums):
    # Count the number of elements
    num_elements = len(nums)
    
    # Check if the number of elements is odd or even
    if num_elements % 2 == 1:
        # Anna's turn, she can always make a move
        return 'Anna'
    else:
        # Sasha's turn, he needs to check if any number is >= 10^m
        max_num = max(nums)
        if max_num >= 10**m:
            return 'Sasha'
        else:
            return 'Anna'

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(determine_winner(n, m, nums))
```

This corrected approach checks if the number of elements is odd or even and determines the winner based on the maximum value of the numbers. If the number of elements is odd, Anna wins because she can always make a move. If the number of elements is even, Sasha wins if any number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
