Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or not, `zero_perc` is 33, `one` is either 1 or 2 depending on the execution path, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` contains the value 4.**

Explanation: The code `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 3, `i + 1` is 4. Therefore, the list `lst` now contains the value 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
