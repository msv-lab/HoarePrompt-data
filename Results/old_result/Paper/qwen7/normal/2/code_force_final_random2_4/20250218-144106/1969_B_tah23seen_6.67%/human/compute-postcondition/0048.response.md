Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, `left` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `left += 1` increments the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was initially equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, after executing the code, `left` is now equal to the length of the list `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
