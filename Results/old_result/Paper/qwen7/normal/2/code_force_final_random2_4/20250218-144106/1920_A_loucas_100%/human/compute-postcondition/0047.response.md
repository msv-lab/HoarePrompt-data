Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in no:`. Therefore, the only variable involved in the loop head is `i` and `no`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `no`**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the `no` list.
   - For the loop to start, `no` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is the iterator of the loop, it will take on the values from `no` during each iteration. However, we don't need to specify the exact value of `i` initially because the loop will start as soon as `no` contains at least one element.
   - We need to ensure that `no` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `no` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`no` must contain at least one element**.
