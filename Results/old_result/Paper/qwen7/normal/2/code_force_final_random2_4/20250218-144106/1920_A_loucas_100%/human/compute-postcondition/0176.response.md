Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `no`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `no`.

3. **Determine the postcondition**: The postcondition states that `no` contains at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2, and `num` is decremented by 1. Additionally, if the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)` is true, then `num` is further decremented by 1.

4. **Analyze the loop body**: Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot directly determine what changes occur inside the loop. However, the loop continues as long as there are elements in `no`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `no` must contain at least one element. Since the loop removes an element from `no` with each iteration, we need to ensure that `no` still has at least one element.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, the key state to adjust is `no`. We need to ensure that `no` still contains at least one value after the current iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2, and `num` is decremented by 1.**
