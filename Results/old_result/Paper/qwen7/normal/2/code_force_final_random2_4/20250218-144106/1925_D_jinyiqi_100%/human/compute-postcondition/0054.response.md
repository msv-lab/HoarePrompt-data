Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`, `f` is an integer from the input, `j` is `j_prev + 2`, `m` is the same as it was before, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the third integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `f` respectively. The values of `sum_f`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged from their previous states.
