### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Ticket Purchase Constraint**: A person can buy up to `m` tickets per day.
2. **Price Increase**: If `x` tickets are bought on day `i`, the price per ticket increases by `x` for all subsequent days.
3. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost to buy `k` tickets.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        s = 0
        c = k * k / 2
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
        print(int(c))
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Sorting the List**: The list `l` is sorted before processing. This sorting is unnecessary because the order of elements in `l` does not affect the final cost calculation when we are buying tickets one by one.
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation inside the loop is incorrect. The formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` does not correctly reflect the price increase for subsequent days.
3. **No Proper Price Update**: The program does not update the prices of subsequent days based on the number of tickets bought on the current day.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate through the days and buy tickets while updating the prices for subsequent days.
2. Ensure that the number of tickets bought does not exceed `m` per day.
3. Calculate the total cost correctly.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the example input:
```
3 2 3
8 6 4
```

- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets (since `m = 2` and `k = 3`). Total cost = 16 (8 * 2), and prices for day 2 become [10, 4].
- Day 2: Buy 1 ticket (since `k = 1`). Total cost = 4 (4 * 1).

Total cost = 16 + 4 = 20.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it sorts the list and uses a different formula which does not reflect the actual cost calculation.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the logic of purchasing tickets and updating the prices for subsequent days. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
