Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved in this loop head is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This means the input value (which determines the number of iterations) can be any integer within this range.
   - Since the loop will run based on the input value, the initial state of `t` directly influences how many times the loop will execute.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set the initial value of `t` to a valid value within the given range. Any value between 1 and \(10^3\) will allow the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
