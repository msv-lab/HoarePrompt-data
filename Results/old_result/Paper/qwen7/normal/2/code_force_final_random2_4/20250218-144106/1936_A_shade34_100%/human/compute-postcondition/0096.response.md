Output State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered data is written to the console. However, this operation does not affect the values of the variables `mak`, `i`, and `n`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
