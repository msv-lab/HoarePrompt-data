Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 4, `path` is the value of `data[index]`, `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was increased by 2, so now it has been increased by a total of 3 (2 + 1). Therefore, the updated value of `index` is increased by 4 compared to its initial state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
