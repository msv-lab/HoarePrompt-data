Output State: `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96`, with each character added sequentially in the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be 3 (since the loop runs for `j` in `range(3)`, and `i` starts from 0, so it increments by 1 for each iteration of `j`), `j` will be 2 (the last value `j` takes in the loop), `cases` remains a positive integer as no changes were made to it within the loop, and `temp` will contain the concatenated string formed by adding the characters corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96` in sequence.
