Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on predefined variables t, n, and k, where t is an integer between 1 and 676, and n and k are integers between 1 and 26. It returns a string that is the concatenation of the substring of 's' from index 0 to k (inclusive) repeated n times.**
