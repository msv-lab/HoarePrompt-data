Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `idx1` is equal to `i`; `idx2` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` both to the current value of `i`. Since `i` was already incremented by 1 in the precondition, `idx1` and `idx2` are also set to this incremented value of `i`. The condition to break out of the loop or if statement (`i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`) is not relevant here as it is not checked or used in the given code snippet.
