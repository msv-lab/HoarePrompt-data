Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is an input integer, `iterable` must be within the range defined by `loop` (i.e., 0 ≤ iterable < loop), `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `innerLoop = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `innerLoop`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
