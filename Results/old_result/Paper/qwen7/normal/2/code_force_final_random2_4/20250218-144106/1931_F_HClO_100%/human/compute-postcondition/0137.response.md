Postcondition: `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2`, `m` equals 1, the list `val` now has one more element which is a tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first element of the unpacked list while `l3` contains the rest of the elements, and either `a1` is inserted at index `idx2` in `l1` (now referenced by `l`), or `a2` is inserted at index `idx1` in `l2` (which is then assigned to `l`), with the condition that `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)` in the former case or greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)` in the latter case.
