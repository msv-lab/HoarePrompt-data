Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`
   - `t` is either `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 == 0)`, where `t2 = a - t1`; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

2. **Determine the Value of `t`:**
   - Since `b` is an integer, let's consider the two cases for `t`:
     - Case 1: `t = b / 2` (if `t % 2` is 0)
     - Case 2: `t = b // 2 + 1` (if `t % 2` is not 0)

3. **Evaluate `t1`:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`

4. **Check Condition and Update `t`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 == 0)`, where `t2 = a - t1`.
   - Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

Given the complexity, let's assume a specific example to simplify the calculation. Let's assume `b = 6` (an even number), so `t = b / 2 = 3`.

- Calculate `t1`:
  \[
  t1 = 3 * 15 - 6 * 4 = 45 - 24 = 21
  \]
- Check the condition `t1 >= a`:
  - Assume `a = 20` (since `t1 = 21` is greater than `a = 20`).
  - Therefore, update `t`:
    \[
    t2 = a - t1 = 20 - 21 = -1
    \]
    \[
    t = t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 == 0) = 3 + (-1) // 15 + (0) = 3 - 0 + 0 = 3
    \]

Since `t` remains unchanged, the final value of `t` is 3.

Output: **3**
