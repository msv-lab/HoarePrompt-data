Output State: **`cx` is empty, `tmp` is equal to the total number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, since `cx` is continuously being iterated over, each element in `cx` is checked against the condition `if i >= bx and i <= ax`. For each element that satisfies this condition, `tmp` is incremented by 1. Since the loop continues until all elements in `cx` have been checked, `cx` will eventually become empty. The final value of `tmp` will be the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the specified range `[bx, ax]`.
