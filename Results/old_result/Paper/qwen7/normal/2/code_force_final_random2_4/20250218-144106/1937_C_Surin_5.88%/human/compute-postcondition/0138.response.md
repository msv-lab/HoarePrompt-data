Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `r` is an input string
   - `g` is 0
   - `v1` is 2
   - `v2` is 2
   - `prev` remains unchanged (still 0)

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The other variables (`r`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `prev`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `v2` is 2, `prev` remains unchanged (still 0)**
