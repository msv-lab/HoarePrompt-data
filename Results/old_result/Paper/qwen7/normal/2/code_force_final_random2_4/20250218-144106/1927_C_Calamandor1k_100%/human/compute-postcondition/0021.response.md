Postcondition: **Both is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, unique_b is a set containing the unique elements from the list b in each tuple of cases, unique_a is a set containing unique elements from list a in each tuple of cases, relevant_a is a set containing elements from unique_a where each element is less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set containing elements from unique_b where each element is less than or equal to k, only_a is a set containing elements from relevant_a that are not in relevant_b, only_b is a set containing elements from relevant_b that are not in relevant_a, results is a list with at least two additional elements 'NO'. If total_distinct is less than k, 'NO' is appended to the results list and we continue with the next iteration or part of the program. If total_distinct is not less than k, no changes are made to the sets or the results list.**
