Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` was previously defined but its specific value was not given, we only know that `idx1` and `idx2` are now both equal to `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
