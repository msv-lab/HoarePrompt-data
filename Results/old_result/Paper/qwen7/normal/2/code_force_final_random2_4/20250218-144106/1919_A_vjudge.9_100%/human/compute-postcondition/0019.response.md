The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` must be at least 2.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Since the string `'Alice'` is being printed directly and no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, the output will be:

Output: **Alice**
