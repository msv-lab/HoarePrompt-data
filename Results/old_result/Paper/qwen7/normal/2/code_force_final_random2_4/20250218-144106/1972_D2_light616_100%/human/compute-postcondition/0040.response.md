Output State: `x` is 2, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1.

Explanation: Based on the given loop and its behavior, we can observe that `x` remains constant at 2 throughout the loop, while `y` increments by 1 each iteration. The loop continues as long as the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` holds true. Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that:

- After the first iteration, `y` becomes 2.
- After the second iteration, `y` becomes 3.
- After the third iteration, `y` becomes 4.

Since the loop condition involves `n` being at least 10 and `m` being at least 20, and considering the gcd condition and the increment of `y`, the loop will continue until `y` reaches 5. At this point, the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` would no longer hold true because `(2 + 5) * 2 = 14`, which is greater than `n` (which is at least 10). Therefore, the loop terminates after the fourth iteration, with `y` being 5. The value of `cnt` remains 1 because the gcd condition was only met once during the loop, and the minimum values of `n` and `m` did not change.
