Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is `l[0] * s - s * s / 2`, `k` is `k - s`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is updated by adding the value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. Since `i` is 0, `l[i]` is `l[0]`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
