Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not designed to handle the game's rules properly. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: 
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is defined to simply subtract `a` from `b` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise it returns `b`. This does not align with the game's rules where players are removed based on positions specified by the sequence `a`.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The game involves removing players at specific positions repeatedly until no more players can be removed in a round.
   - The positions to remove are determined by the sequence `a`, and the process continues until no more players can be removed.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The program needs to simulate the removal of players according to the sequence `a` and keep track of the remaining players.
   - It should continue the process until no more players can be removed in a round.
   - The final count of remaining players should be returned as the result.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly simulate the game's logic and thus is incorrect.
