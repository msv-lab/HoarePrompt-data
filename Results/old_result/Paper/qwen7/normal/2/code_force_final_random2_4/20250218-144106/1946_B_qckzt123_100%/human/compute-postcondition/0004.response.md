Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in the input line to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, splits the line into elements, and then maps each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `a`. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
