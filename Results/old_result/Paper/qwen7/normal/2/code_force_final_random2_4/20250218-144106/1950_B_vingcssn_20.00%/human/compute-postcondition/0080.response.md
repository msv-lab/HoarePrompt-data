Output: **##..##..**

Explanation: The initial state does not provide any specific values for the variables `casos`, `c`, `t`, or `n`. The only information given is that `casos` must be greater than 0, `c` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 20, and `n` is an integer input. Since the print statement simply outputs a string `##..##..`, and no variables from the initial state are used in this statement, the output remains as the string itself.
