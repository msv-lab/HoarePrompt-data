Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-2`, `k` equals `req`, `l` contains the elements as follows: if any two consecutive elements in `b` from index 1 to `n-2` are the same, then those elements are appended to `l` twice or once depending on their count, and `ans1` contains the repeated elements as described in the previous states.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and the current value of `k` is either -2 or 0, depending on whether the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` is true or false. If the condition is true, `ans2` contains the value of `c[i]` which is equal to the current value of `c[i - 1]` and `ans2` has appended this value. If the condition is false, `ans2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is -2, and `ans2` now contains the elements `c[2]` and `c[3]`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` remains -2 and `ans2` contains the elements `c[2]` and `c[3]`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` remains 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `k` is -2, and if `c[4]` is equal to `c[3]`, then `ans2` contains the elements `c[4]` appended. If `c[4]` is not equal to `c[3]`, then `ans2` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
