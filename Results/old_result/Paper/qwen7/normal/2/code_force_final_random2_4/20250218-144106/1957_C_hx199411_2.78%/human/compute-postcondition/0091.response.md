Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 1, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is the total number of inputs processed, `m` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of 3 zeros with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3, `dp[3] = 8**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is `k + 2` where `k` is 1, so `i` is 3. The code updates `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Given `i` is 3, we calculate `dp[3]` as follows:

- `dp[1]` is 1.
- `dp[2]` is 3.
- For `dp[3]`: `dp[3] = (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (3 + 4) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7 % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7`.

Since `i` was 3, `dp[3]` is updated to 8. All other variables remain unchanged.
