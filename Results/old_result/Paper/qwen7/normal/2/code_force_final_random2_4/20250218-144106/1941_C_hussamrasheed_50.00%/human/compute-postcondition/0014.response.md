Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer (though `n` is not used in the print statement).
- `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
- `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`.
- `p` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s`.

The print statement is `print(m + p)`. Here, `m` represents the number of times 'map' appeared in the original string `s`, and `p` represents the number of times 'pie' appears in the updated string `s` after removing all occurrences of 'map'.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `m` and `p`. However, we know that `m + p` will be the sum of these two counts.

Output: **m + p (where m is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original s and p is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated s)**
