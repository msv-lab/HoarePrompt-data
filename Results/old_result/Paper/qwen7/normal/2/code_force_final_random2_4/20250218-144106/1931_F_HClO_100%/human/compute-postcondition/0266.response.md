Output State: **`idx2` is `n - 2`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, and the list `l` now contains an additional element `a2` at index `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `l = l2` assigns the list `l2` to the variable `l`. This does not change the values of `idx2`, `idx1`, or `p2`. The list `l2` originally had an additional element `a2` at index `n - 2`, and since `l` is now `l2`, the same is true for `l`.
