Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all input test cases are processed. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated based on user input, and `k` will be set to the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output will be `a * n`. Otherwise, the output will be `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is recalculated for each new set of inputs.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the last set of inputs provided by the user, and `k` will be the minimum value between the final `n` and `b - a`. The output will be determined by the condition `if b <= a` and will either be `a * n` or `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, depending on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` after the last iteration.
