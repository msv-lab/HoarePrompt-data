Output State: **The list `ans` contains all integers from 1 to 1024 (inclusive).**

Explanation: The loop runs 20 times, and in each iteration, it appends \(1 << j\) to the list `ans` as long as \(j \neq i\). Given that \(i\) is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\), and considering \(k\) can be up to 1024 (since \(1024 = 2^{10}\) and we are appending powers of 2 starting from \(2^0 = 1\)), the loop will append all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{10}\) to the list `ans`. Therefore, after all iterations, `ans` will contain all integers from 1 to 1024.
