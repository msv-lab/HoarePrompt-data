Postcondition: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 27, `u` is `(a[0] >> 27 & 1)`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]`, and if `v` is not 0, `op` is the result of XORing the initial value of `op` (which is 0) with the results of `val >> i & 1` for each `val` in `a`, `cnt` is the total number of times `op` becomes 0 during the loop, which is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `val` is the second last element of the list `a`, `a` must have at least two elements, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `cnt`. If `v` is 0, `t` remains an empty list, `ans` remains either -1 or 0, `i` remains 27, `u` remains `(a[0] >> 27 & 1)`, `v` remains the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
