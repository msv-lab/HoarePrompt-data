Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, all of which are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts a list named rows, which contains n lists. Each inner list has m positive integers, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0. The function calculates the minimum sum of costs over every possible subsequence of length k in the costs list, which itself is derived from the input rows list using another function func_1. Finally, it prints this minimum sum.**
