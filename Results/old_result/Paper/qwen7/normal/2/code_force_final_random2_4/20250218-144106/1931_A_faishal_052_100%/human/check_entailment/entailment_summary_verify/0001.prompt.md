You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, where each case involves an integer `lex`. For each `lex`, it constructs an array `arr` based on certain conditions, appends `lex` to `arr`, sorts `arr`, and stores the result in a list `info`. Finally, it prints a string composed of characters corresponding to the first three elements of the sorted array for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - It then reads `cases` lines, each containing an integer `lex`, which is the encoded value.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `lex` into a three-letter word.
   - It uses a list `arr` to store the decoded values of the letters.
   - The logic for decoding seems flawed and does not correctly handle the range of possible values for `lex`.

3. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The program checks if `lex` is less than 28, 52, or 78, which is incorrect for the given problem constraints.
   - If `lex` is less than 28, it incorrectly appends 1 and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it incorrectly appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it again incorrectly appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - Finally, it appends the remaining value to `arr` and sorts `arr`.

4. **Sorting and Output:**
   - The program sorts the list `arr` and converts each element to the corresponding character using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` and concatenates them to form the word.

### Correctness Check

Given the flawed logic in the decoding process, let's consider the correct approach:

1. **Correct Decoding:**
   - For a three-letter word `abc`, the encoded value is `a + b + c`.
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start with the smallest possible values for `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Revised Logic:**
   - Start with `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = 1`.
   - Increment `c` until the sum reaches the given encoded value.
   - If `c` exceeds 26, reset `c` to 1 and increment `b`.
   - If `b` exceeds 26, reset `b` to 1 and increment `a`.

### Revised Program

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        a, b, c = 1, 1, 1
        while a + b + c < lex:
            if c < 26:
                c += 1
            else:
                c = 1
                if b < 26:
                    b += 1
                else:
                    b = 1
                    a += 1
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has a flawed decoding logic and does not correctly produce the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
