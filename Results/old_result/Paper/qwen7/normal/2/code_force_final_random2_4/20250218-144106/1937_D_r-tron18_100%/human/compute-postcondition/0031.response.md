Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[i]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `zeroInd` to be the sum of the last two elements of the list `suffZero`. The values of `el`, `s1[i]`, `el` not being equal to '>', `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, and the condition that `zr` is less than or equal to `ol` remain unchanged from the initial state.
