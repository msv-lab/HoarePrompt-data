Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; and `v` is not equal to `tree[-1]`; `u` is not equal to `tree[0]`; `tree` now has one additional element which is `v`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `tree`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `u` is equal to the last element of `tree` before the append operation still holds true after the append operation because `v` is appended as the new last element.
