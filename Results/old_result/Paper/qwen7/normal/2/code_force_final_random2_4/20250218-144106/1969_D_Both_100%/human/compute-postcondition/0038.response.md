Postcondition: **`current_profit`, `test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `n`, `k`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged. `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, with the last item popped. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.**
