Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is `[T[0] - a[0], T[1] - a[1], ..., T[n-3] - a[n-3], T[n-2] - a[n-2]]`, `result` is an empty string, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be non-zero, `line` is the input string, `T` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. Initially, `a` is defined as `[1000, a[n-3] - T[n-3], a[n-4] - T[n-4], ..., a[0] - T[0]]`. After reversing, `a` becomes `[T[0] - a[0], T[1] - a[1], ..., T[n-3] - a[n-3], T[n-2] - a[n-2]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
