Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is unchanged, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is unchanged, `oneInd` is unchanged, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns `totalOne` to `ol` and `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
