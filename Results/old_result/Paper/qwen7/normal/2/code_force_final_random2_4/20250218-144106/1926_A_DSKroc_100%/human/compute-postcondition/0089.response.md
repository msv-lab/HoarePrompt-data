Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the last character of `s`, `ac` is equal to the total number of 'A's in `s`, and `bc` is equal to the total number of characters in `s` minus the number of 'A's. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the number of 'A's (`ac`) is less than or equal to the number of other characters (`bc`).**
