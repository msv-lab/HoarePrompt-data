Output State: **`i` is equal to `bets`, `ans` is a string containing the character `str(a[i])` followed by a space and a single space.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. Since `ans` was initially a string containing the character `str(a[i])` followed by a space, after executing the code, `ans` will contain the same content but with an additional space at the end. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `bets`.
