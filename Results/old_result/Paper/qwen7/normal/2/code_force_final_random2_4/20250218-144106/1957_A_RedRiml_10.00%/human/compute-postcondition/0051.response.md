Output: **3**

Explanation: The variable `shapes` is explicitly given as 3. The `print(shapes)` statement will simply print the value of `shapes`, which is 3. The other variables `j` and the conditions on `d[j]` are not relevant to the print statement since `shapes` is directly provided with a value.
