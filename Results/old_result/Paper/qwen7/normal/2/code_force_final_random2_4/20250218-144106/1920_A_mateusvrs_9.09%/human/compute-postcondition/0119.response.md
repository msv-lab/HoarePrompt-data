Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is as provided in the last input, `x` is as provided in the last input, `bx` is as calculated in the last iteration, `ax` is as calculated in the last iteration, `cx` is as calculated in the last iteration, `r` is as calculated in the last iteration, `tmp` is as calculated in the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. All other variables (`a`, `x`, `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `r`, `tmp`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The variable `t` is decremented by 1, making it `t - 1`.
