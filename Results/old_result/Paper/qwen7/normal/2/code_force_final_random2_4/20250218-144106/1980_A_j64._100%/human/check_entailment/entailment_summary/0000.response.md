Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and the string `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Count Initialization**: It initializes a list `count` of size 7 (to represent the 7 difficulty levels 'A' to 'G') and sets all elements to 0.
   - **Character Counting**: It iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the character's position ('A' -> 0, 'B' -> 1, ..., 'G' -> 6).
   - **Calculating Needed Problems**: For each difficulty level, it checks if the count is less than `m`. If so, it calculates the difference and adds it to `needed_problems`.
   - **Return Statement**: Finally, it returns the total number of additional problems needed.

3. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program correctly implements the required functionality without any logical errors or discrepancies.

Correctness: **True**
