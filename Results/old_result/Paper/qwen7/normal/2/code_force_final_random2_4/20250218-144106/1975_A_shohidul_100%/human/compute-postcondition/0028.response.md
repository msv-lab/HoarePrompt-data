Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))`. However, the specific values of `new` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `new_all`. But the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`, regardless of the value of `new_all`. Therefore, the output will be `'YES'`.
