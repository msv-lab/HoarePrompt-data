Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % 1000000007`
- `i` is 4

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop starts from `i = 3` and goes up to `i = m`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5.

### Adjusting the States
- **Variable `i`**: It needs to be updated to 5.
- **Variable `dp[i]`**: Since `i` is now 5, we need to compute `dp[5]` based on the previous values of `dp`.

### Computation of `dp[5]`
Given the recurrence relation implied by the previous computation of `dp[4]`, we can infer the general form:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 3 \cdot dp[i-2] \cdot 2) \mod 1000000007 \]

For `i = 5`:
\[ dp[5] = (dp[4] + 3 \cdot dp[3] \cdot 2) \mod 1000000007 \]

Since `dp[4]` is already computed as `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % 1000000007`, we need to use this value and the previous values of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` to compute `dp[5]`.

### Final State
- `dp[4]` remains the same as `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % 1000000007`
- `i` is updated to 5
- `dp[5]` is computed as `(dp[4] + 3 * dp[3] * 2) % 1000000007`

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % 1000000007`, `i` is 5, `dp[5]` is `(dp[4] + 3 * dp[3] * 2) % 1000000007`**
