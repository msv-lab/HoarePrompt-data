Postcondition: `current_profit` is updated based on the condition `removed_item[0] + removed_item[1] >= 0`; if true, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[1]`, otherwise increased by `removed_item[0]`; `heap` is modified by pushing `removed_item` and popping the smallest element; `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order with the last item popped; `removed_item` is true; `current_profit` is greater than or equal to `max_profit` if the if condition is met. If the if condition is not met, `current_profit` remains unchanged.
