Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; each test case is a list containing three integers n, x, and y such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; and each test case also includes a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected, and the conditions for the initial state remain unchanged.
