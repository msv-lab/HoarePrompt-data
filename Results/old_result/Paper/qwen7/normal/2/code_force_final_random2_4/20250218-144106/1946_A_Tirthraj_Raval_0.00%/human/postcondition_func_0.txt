The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads a positive integer \( n \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers. It sorts the list and calculates the count of the middle element (or the average of the two middle elements if \( n \) is even) in the sorted list. The function prints this count for each test case.
