Output State: **`results` contains the value of `beautiful_count`, `case` is updated to `case['params']` containing `n`, `x`, and `y`, `test_cases` must have more elements to process, `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`, and an empty dictionary `freq` is created.**

In this step, the code creates an empty dictionary named `freq`. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
