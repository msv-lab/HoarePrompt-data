Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1 or r[2] + a, `y1` is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1, `x2` is r[4] - a, `y2` is either 1 or m, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and (x2 - x1) is odd, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `t` is abs(r[5] - r[3]), `x2` is greater than or equal to x1, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to n, `c` is either y1 - 1 or m - y1 depending on the path taken through the if-else block, **b // 2 is less than or equal to a or abs(x2 - c) is less than x1 + c or y1 is not in the range [1, m] or x1 is not in the range [1, n]**.
