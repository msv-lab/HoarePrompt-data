Output State: **`s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `t` is the number of test cases such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `pre` is a list of integers where each element is (i + 1) for every index i where s1[i] == '>'**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `pre` that contains the positions (index + 1) of all the '>' characters in the string `s1`. The length of `s1` remains `n`, and the value of `t` remains unchanged.
