Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `c` and the value `casos`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for c in range(0, casos)` will execute as long as `casos` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `c` will take values from 0 up to `casos-1`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will start with `c = 0`, the initial value of `c` should be set to 0.
   - The value of `casos` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `casos` is an input integer and \(1 \leq \text{casos} \leq 20\).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).

We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute at least once. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `casos` to be greater than 0.

State: **`casos` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\)**
