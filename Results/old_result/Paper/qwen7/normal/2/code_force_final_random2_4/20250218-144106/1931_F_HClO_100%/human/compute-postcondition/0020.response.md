Output State: **`input_var` is the value taken as input, `m - 2` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The code `input()` reads a value from the user and assigns it to the variable `input_var`. However, since no variable named `input_var` is defined in the given code, the input value is stored in a new variable (which is not mentioned in the initial state). The variable `m - 2` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the `input()` function.
