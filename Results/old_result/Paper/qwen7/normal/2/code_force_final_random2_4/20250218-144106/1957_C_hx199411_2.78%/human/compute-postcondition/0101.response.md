Postcondition: `i` is equal to `k + 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is the total number of inputs processed, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` equals 0, then `i` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is set to 6, `k` is a positive integer, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is the total number of inputs processed, `m` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, and `dp` is a list with specific values: `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, `dp[3] = 8`, `dp[4] = 26`, `dp[5] = 114`, and `dp[6] = 514`.
