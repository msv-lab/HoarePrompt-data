Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `q` is equal to `cn2`; `p` is `p` divided by `gcd`.**

Explanation: The code `q = q // gcd` divides `q` by `gcd`. Initially, `q` was equal to `2 * cn2`. After dividing `q` by `gcd`, `q` becomes `cn2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `gcd` remains the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `q` is now `cn2`, and `p` is still `p` divided by `gcd`.
