Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `cnt` is 1, `l` is less than `n + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates `cnt` to the value of `k` and `l` to 1. The initial values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` are preserved except for `cnt` which is now set to 1. The condition that `l` is less than `n + 1` remains valid as `l` is updated to 1, which is less than `n + 1`.
