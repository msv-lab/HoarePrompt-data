### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `s`, `k`, and `n`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if each character is in the `alphabet`. If so, it removes the character from `alphabet` if the `alphabet` has more than one character, otherwise, it appends the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to the full set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It always appends the character to `s1`.
   - After the loop, `s1` contains all characters from `s` that are in the `alphabet`, `s2` is an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets if `len(alphabet)` was not reduced to 1 during any iteration, otherwise it is a set containing a single character.
   - The function then calculates `r` as `len(s1) // k` and returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It calls `func_1(s, k, n)` and checks the returned values.
   - If the first value in the returned tuple is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`. It then constructs a string `be9i` of length `n - len(s2)` using the first character in `alphabet` that is not in `s1` and appends `s2` to it. It appends `'No'` and `be9i` to the output list `OUT`.
   - If the first value is `True`, it means all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`. It appends `'Yes'` to the output list `OUT`.

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints each element in `OUT`.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the main program correctly follows the problem statement. It checks if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s` and constructs the appropriate output accordingly. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
