Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input()` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
