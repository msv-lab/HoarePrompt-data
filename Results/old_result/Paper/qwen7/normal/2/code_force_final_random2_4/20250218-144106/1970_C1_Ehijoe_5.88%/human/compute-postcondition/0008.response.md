Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; `tree` contains the elements `u` and `v`; `empty` is `False`**.

The variable `empty` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
