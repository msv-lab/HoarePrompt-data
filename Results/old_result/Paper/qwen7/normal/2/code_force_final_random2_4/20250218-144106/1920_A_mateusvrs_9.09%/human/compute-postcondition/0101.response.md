Output State: **`n` will be 0, `a` will be an integer from the last input, `x` will be an integer from the last input, `bx` will be the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1 during the loop, `ax` will be the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2 during the loop, and `cx` will be a set containing all `x` where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 during the loop. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is 0.**

The code initializes `tmp` to 0, which does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, `ax`, and `cx`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
