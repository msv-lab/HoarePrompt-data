The loop condition is `R - L > 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must be true. The variables involved in this condition are `R` and `L`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. The loop will continue as long as `R - L > 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition `R - L > 1`. This means either `R` should be increased or `L` should be decreased (or both).

Given the current state:
- `numCuts` is 0
- `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`

Since the loop condition involves `R` and `L`, and no direct changes to these variables are mentioned in the postcondition, we need to ensure that the values of `R` and `L` are such that `R - L > 1`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the values of `R` and/or `L` to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `R - L` must be greater than 1**
