Output State: **`li` has a new element which is `a + k * c + d * h`, and `a`, `c`, `d`, and `h` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of the expression `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. The values of `a`, `c`, `d`, and `h` remain unchanged, and `li` gains a new element with the computed value.
