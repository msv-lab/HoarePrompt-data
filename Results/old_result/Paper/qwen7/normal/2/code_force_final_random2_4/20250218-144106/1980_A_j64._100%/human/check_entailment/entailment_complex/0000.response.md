Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m` followed by the string `a`.

2. **Character Counting**: The function `func_1` correctly initializes a count array to keep track of the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the string `a`.

3. **Calculation of Needed Problems**: 
   - The function iterates over the count array to check how many of each difficulty level are available.
   - For each difficulty level that is less than `m`, it calculates the difference and adds it to `needed_problems`.
   - This ensures that the minimum number of additional problems needed is calculated correctly.

4. **Output**: The function returns the total number of additional problems needed, which matches the problem statement requirements.

Given the provided annotated program and the explanation, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` is correct and aligns with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
