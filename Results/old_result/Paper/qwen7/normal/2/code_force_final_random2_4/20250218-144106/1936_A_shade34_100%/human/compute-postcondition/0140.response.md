Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing 1 and 3, `s` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `pans`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `pans` now contains the values [1, 3].
