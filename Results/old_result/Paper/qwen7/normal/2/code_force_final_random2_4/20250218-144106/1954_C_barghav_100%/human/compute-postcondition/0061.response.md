Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(b))`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` and `b` are strings.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `b` must have a length of 3.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(b)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4, and `b` must have a length of 3.

4. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 4, it cannot be less than `len(b)` (which is 3).
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again because the condition `i < len(b)` is false.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop will not execute again, no changes are needed for `i` or `len(b)`.
   - However, we should ensure that the state reflects the fact that the loop will not run again.

Given this analysis, the final state remains the same as the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` and `b` are strings, `i` is 4, `b` must have a length of 3**
