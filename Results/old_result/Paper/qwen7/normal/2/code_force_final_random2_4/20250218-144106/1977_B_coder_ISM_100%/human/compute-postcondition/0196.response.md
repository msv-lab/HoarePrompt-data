Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `length`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `length` is 30
   - If `s[1]` is '-1', no changes are made to the variables (this condition does not affect the loop itself).

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `length`.
   - Currently, `i` is 2 and `length` is 30, so `i < length` is true.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop condition is satisfied, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

6. **Final States**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `length` remains unchanged at 30.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `length` is 30**
