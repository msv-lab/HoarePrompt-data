The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer \( t \) (indicating the number of test cases), two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, the function calculates and prints the total adjustment needed based on the condition that if the count of any character in \( s \) is less than \( m \), the adjustment is \( m \) minus the count of that character. The final output is the total adjustment for each test case.
