Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program calculates `ans` using `(n + b) // (b * b)` which does not align with the problem statement's requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To illustrate this, consider the test case `n = 10` and `m = 8`. According to the problem description, we need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Let's manually check a few pairs:
- For (1, 1): `1 + 1 = 2`, and `gcd(1, 1) = 1`, so `2` is a multiple of `1 * 1`.
- For (2, 1): `2 + 1 = 3`, and `gcd(2, 1) = 1`, so `3` is not a multiple of `1 * 1`.
- For (2, 2): `2 + 2 = 4`, and `gcd(2, 2) = 2`, so `4` is a multiple of `2 * 2`.

The program incorrectly adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` to `ans` without checking if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds true for each pair. This leads to an incorrect count of valid pairs.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
