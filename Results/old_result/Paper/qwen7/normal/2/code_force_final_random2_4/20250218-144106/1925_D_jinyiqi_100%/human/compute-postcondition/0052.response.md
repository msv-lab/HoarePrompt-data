Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`, `f` is an integer from the input, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `m` is the same as it was before.**

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` adds the value of `f` to `sum_f`. Since `f` is an integer from the input, `sum_f` now holds the sum of its previous value and `f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
