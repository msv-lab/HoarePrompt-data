Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `mini` will be the minimum value between its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` remains 5. `final` contains all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`, and `final` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `mini`, `pk`, and `lst`, and only mentions that `ele` remains 5, the specific values of `mini` and `final` cannot be determined. The only thing we know for certain is that `final` now contains elements from `lst` with the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`, and it is sorted.
