Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`, and `arr` contains the elements 26 and 26. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` becomes either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`. If `lex` is 28 or more, `lex` remains as either `lex - 27` or `lex - 26`, and `arr` still contains the elements 26, 26.
