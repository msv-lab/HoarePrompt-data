Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the next character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing each character of `sChar` with the additional character `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s.append(i)` appends the character `i` to the list `s`. Since `i` is the next character in `sChar`, it is added to the existing list `s`, which already contains all characters of `sChar`. Therefore, `s` now includes all characters of `sChar` plus the additional character `i`.
