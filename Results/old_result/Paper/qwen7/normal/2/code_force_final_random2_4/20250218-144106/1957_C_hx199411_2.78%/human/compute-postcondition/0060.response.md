Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `num` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was 0 according to the initial state). Since no specific initial value for `num` was given other than it being 0, we can directly state that `num` is now 1. The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
