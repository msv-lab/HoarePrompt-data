### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the rules of the game and determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy.

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers \( n \) and the parameter \( m \).
   - It then reads the list of integers \( nums \).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes \( n \), \( m \), and the list of integers \( nums \).
   - It calculates the total length of the string representations of all integers in \( nums \).
   - It sorts a list of the number of trailing zeros in each integer in descending order.
   - It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, subtracting the sum of every second element from the total length.
   - It returns 'Sasha' if the resulting total is greater than or equal to \( m + 1 \), otherwise it returns 'Anna'.

3. **Function `zerocnts`**:
   - The function `zerocnts` takes an integer `num` and returns the number of trailing zeros in its string representation.
   - This function is used to generate the list of trailing zeros for sorting in `func_1`.

### Analysis of Logic:

- **Trailing Zeros Calculation**:
  - The `zerocnts` function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a number. This is used to sort the numbers based on their trailing zeros, which is crucial for the game logic.

- **Game Logic**:
  - The main logic in `func_1` involves calculating the total length of the numbers and then adjusting this length based on the number of trailing zeros.
  - The idea seems to be that if the adjusted total length is greater than or equal to \( m + 1 \), Sasha can force a win by concatenating numbers in a way that results in a number greater than or equal to \( 10^m \).
  - Conversely, if the adjusted total length is less than \( m + 1 \), Anna can prevent Sasha from winning.

### Correctness Check:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles edge cases like single-digit numbers and numbers with many trailing zeros correctly.
  - The logic of subtracting the sum of every second element in the sorted list of trailing zeros seems to be a strategic move to determine if Sasha can force a win.

- **Optimal Play**:
  - The logic appears to be based on a strategic calculation that aligns with the rules of the game. If Sasha can force a number greater than or equal to \( 10^m \), he wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on optimal play.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states of the program.
