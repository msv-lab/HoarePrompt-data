Postcondition: **`count` is 2, `n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer input from the user, `list0` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `i` is 2, `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`, and if `num` equals 1, then no change is made to the variables.**
