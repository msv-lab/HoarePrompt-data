Output State: **`t` is a tuple of integers returned by the lambda function `r()`.**

Explanation: The initial state defines that `t` is a positive integer. However, the code `t, = r()` assigns the result of calling the lambda function `r()` to `t`. Since `r()` returns a tuple of integers, `t` is now a tuple containing those integers. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer no longer holds because it has been reassigned to a tuple. All other variables remain unaffected.
