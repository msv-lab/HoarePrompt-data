Output State: The list `cnt` will contain the count of each integer from the list `a`. After all iterations of the loop, each element `cnt[x]` will represent how many times the integer `x` appeared in the list `a`.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `cnt` list will hold the frequency of each integer found in the list `a`. Each index `x` in the `cnt` list will store the total number of occurrences of the integer `x` as it appeared in the original list `a`. Since each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, no integer will have a count greater than 2 in the final `cnt` list.
