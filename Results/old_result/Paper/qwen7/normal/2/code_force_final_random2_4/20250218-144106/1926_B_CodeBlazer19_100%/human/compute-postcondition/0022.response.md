Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or remains 0, `b` is either an empty string or becomes 'SQUARE', `s` is the input string, and the count of '1' in `s` is either exactly 1 or greater than 1. If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, then `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.
