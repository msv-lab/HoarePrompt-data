Output State: **`idx1` is equal to `i` and `p1` is 1, or `idx2` is equal to `i` and `p2` is 1, while `t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` remains as the integer read from input in the first iteration, `a2` remains as the integer read from input in the second iteration, `l11` remains as the list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` remains as the list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, and the elements at indices `(i + 1) + p1` in lists `l1` and `l2` are not equal, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
