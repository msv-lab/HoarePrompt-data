Output State: **`current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`, `max_profit` remains equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, except for the item just pushed (which is `item`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is now one item shorter.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` subtracts the value of `removed_item[0]` from `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
