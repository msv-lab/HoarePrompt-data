### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for `t`, `n`, `m`, and the queries. This part is handled correctly using the `map` function and the `lambda` function defined at the beginning.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the distances between consecutive cities and stores them in the list `b`. However, the calculation logic seems incorrect. Specifically, the formula `b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` does not seem to accurately represent the logic needed to find the closest city distances. Instead, it appears to be trying to accumulate some values, but the logic is flawed.

3. **Query Processing**: The program processes each query by calculating the minimum cost to travel between the two cities. It uses the precomputed values in `b` to determine the cost. However, the logic used to compute these values in `b` is incorrect, leading to wrong results.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the input constraints are met, but due to the incorrect calculation of distances, the results are not accurate.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the program is not correct because the logic used to calculate the distances and store them in `b` is flawed. Therefore, the output for the queries will not be accurate.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: **False**
