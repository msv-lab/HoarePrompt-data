Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`, `a` is `l[x]`**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `a`. Given that `x` is `n + 1`, `a` is set to the element at index `n + 1` of list `l`. The values of `n`, `y`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
