Output State: **`i` is 2; `a` has an element appended which is the value of `a[1] - T[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, this translates to appending `a[1] - T[1]` to the list `a`. The initial state of `i` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than the input integer is still valid.
