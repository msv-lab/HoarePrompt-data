Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `op` is 0 ^ (val >> 28 & 1), `ai` is `ai` XOR `val`, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]**.

Explanation: The line `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. Since `val` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `ai` is updated based on the current value of `val`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
