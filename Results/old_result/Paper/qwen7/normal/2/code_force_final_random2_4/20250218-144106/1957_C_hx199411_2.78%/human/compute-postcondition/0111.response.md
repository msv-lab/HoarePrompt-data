Output State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is 2, `i` is 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given that `num` was initially 0, after executing this line, `num` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
