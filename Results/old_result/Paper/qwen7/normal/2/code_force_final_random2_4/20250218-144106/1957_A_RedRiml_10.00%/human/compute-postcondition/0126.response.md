Output State: **`d.get(i)` is either 1 (if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`) or incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` was not `None`), `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`, and `pl` now includes `i`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. This does not affect the values of `d.get(i)` or `i_val`, but ensures that `i` is included in `pl` if it was not already present. The value of `d.get(i)` is updated according to its initial state (either incremented by 1 or set to 1).
