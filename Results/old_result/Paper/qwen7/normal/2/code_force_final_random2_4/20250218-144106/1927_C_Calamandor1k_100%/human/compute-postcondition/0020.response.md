Output State: **Both is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, unique_b is a set containing the unique elements from the list b in each tuple of cases, unique_a is a set containing unique elements from list a in each tuple of cases, relevant_a is a set containing elements from unique_a where each element is less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set containing elements from unique_b where each element is less than or equal to k, only_a is a set containing elements from relevant_a that are not in relevant_b, only_b is a set containing elements from relevant_b that are not in relevant_a, results is a list with at least two additional elements 'NO', and the current value of total_distinct is 'NO' appended to the results list, and we continue with the next iteration or part of the program.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the flow of the program moves to the next iteration, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement itself does not affect the values of the variables listed in the initial state.
