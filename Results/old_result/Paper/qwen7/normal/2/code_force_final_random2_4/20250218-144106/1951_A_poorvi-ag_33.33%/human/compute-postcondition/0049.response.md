Output State: The `results` list will contain either three 'no' or three 'no' followed by one 'yes', depending on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.

Natural Language Description: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `results` list will consist of three elements. Each element is determined based on the conditions inside the loop. If for any iteration, the input string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', then 'yes' will be appended to the `results` list at that position. However, if this condition is not met for any iteration, 'no' will be appended instead. Therefore, the final `results` list could be ['no', 'no', 'no'], ['no', 'no', 'yes'], or ['no', 'yes', 'yes'], but it cannot have more than one 'yes'.
