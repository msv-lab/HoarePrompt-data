Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `y` is an integer input from the user, `list0` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `list0` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the original unsorted `list0` are not changed. After sorting, `list0` contains the same elements as before but in sorted order.
