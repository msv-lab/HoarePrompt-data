Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'L'; `b` is a list with one element `a[r-1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was initially to `r-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
