Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`**

Explanation: The code subtracts the value of `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Since `s` was initially the value of `p[b - 1]`, after executing `s -= p[a - 2]`, `s` now holds the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. The other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
