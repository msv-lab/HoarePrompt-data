Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `a` is an array, `mod_x` is num % x, `mod_y` is num % y, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `required_mod_y` is num % y, `beautiful_count` is unchanged unless `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, in which case `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.**

This means that the frequency count of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
