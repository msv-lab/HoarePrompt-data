Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, and the input function allows any valid integer within this range, the updated state reflects that `t` is now an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
