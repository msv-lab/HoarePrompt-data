Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n)`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `n > 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` will be 0, `m` will be less than or equal to 1, `arr[i - 1]` will be equal to `nums[0]` if no swap was made during the last iteration, and `arr[i]` will be unchanged or adjusted according to the loop conditions. `ans` will be `False` if any swap was made during the iterations that caused `nums` to be unsorted, otherwise, it will remain `True` if no such condition was met.

3. **Adjust the States**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is the only variable in the loop head, it is the only one that needs to be adjusted.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `n` must be greater than 0.

**State: **`i` is 0, `m` is less than or equal to 1, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]` if no swap was made during the last iteration, and `arr[i]` is unchanged or adjusted according to the loop conditions. `ans` is `False` if any swap was made during the iterations that caused `nums` to be unsorted, otherwise, it remains `True` if no such condition was met. `n` must be greater than 0.**
