Output State: **`i` is `n-1` minus 1, `k` is 0, `ans2` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `c[1]` to `c[n-2]` twice each, and `l` must have at least 1 element; `ans1` now includes the element `l[i]`, and `ans2` has appended `l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the value of `l[i]` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is `n-1` minus 1, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The value of `k` also remains unchanged. `ans1` includes the element `l[i]`, and `ans2` now contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `c[1]` to `c[n-2]` twice each, plus the newly appended element `l[i]`.
