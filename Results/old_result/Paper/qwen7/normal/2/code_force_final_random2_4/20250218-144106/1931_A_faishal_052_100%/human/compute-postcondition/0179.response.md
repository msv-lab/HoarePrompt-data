Output State: `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96) + chr(info[0][2] + 96) + chr(info[0][3] + 96) + chr(info[0][4] + 96).

In this final output state, the variable `i` remains 0 because the loop only iterates over the `j` variable which ranges from 0 to 2. After three iterations, `j` becomes 3. The variable `cases` remains a positive integer as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `temp` contains the concatenated result of converting the elements of `info[0]` from index 0 to 4 (inclusive) to characters using the formula `chr(element + 96)`.
