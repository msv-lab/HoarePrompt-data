Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers, assigning them to variables `a` and `b`. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated variables `a` and `b` along with the unchanged precondition for `m`.
