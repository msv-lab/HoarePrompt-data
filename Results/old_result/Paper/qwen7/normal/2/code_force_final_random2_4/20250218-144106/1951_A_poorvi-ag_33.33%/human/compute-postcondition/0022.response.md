Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string from input.**

The code `results.append('no')` appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Since the initial state already includes `results` being a list containing `'no'`, appending `'no'` again does not change the list's content. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
