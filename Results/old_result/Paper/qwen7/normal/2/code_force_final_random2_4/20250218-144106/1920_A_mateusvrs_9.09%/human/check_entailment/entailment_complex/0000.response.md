Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
3. It initializes variables `ax` and `bx` to handle the constraints of type 1 and type 2, respectively. `ax` is initialized to a large value to ensure any valid constraint of type 2 will update it, and `bx` is initialized to -1 to ensure any valid constraint of type 1 will update it.
4. It processes each constraint, updating `ax`, `bx`, and a set `cx` to keep track of values for constraints of type 3.
5. After processing all constraints for a test case, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list `r` because no valid `k` can satisfy both constraints.
6. If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in that range (`ax - bx + 1`).
7. The final result list `r` is printed, which contains the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function appears to be correct and matches the requirements. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
