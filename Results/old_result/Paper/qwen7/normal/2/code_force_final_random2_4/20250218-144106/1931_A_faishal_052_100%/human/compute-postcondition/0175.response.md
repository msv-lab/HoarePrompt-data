Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96) + chr(info[0][2] + 96)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `temp` by adding `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` to its current value. Initially, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, so `temp` is updated using `info[0][1]`. After that, `j` is incremented by 1 (since `j` is less than 3), making `j` equal to 2. Thus, `temp` now includes both `chr(info[0][0] + 96)` and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
