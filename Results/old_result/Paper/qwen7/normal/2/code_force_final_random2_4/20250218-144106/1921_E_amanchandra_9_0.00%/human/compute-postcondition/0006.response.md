Output State: **`i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers obtained from the input split, and `x` is equal to the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2.**

This means that the variable `x` is now assigned the value of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, while all other variables retain their initial states.
