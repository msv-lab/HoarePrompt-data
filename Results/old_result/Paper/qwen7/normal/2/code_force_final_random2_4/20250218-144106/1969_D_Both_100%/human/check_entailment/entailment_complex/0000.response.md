Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem statement.
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads multiple integers separated by spaces and returns them as a map object. However, the actual implementation should convert the map object to a list of integers, which is implied but not explicitly done in the code snippet. This discrepancy might cause issues, but since the problem description assumes valid inputs, we can assume the conversion happens elsewhere.
3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function calculates the total profit by considering the items in `primary_items` and `secondary_heap`. The logic is correct, but there is a potential issue with the condition `if item[0] + item[1] >= 0`. This condition ensures that only profitable items are considered, which aligns with the problem requirements.
4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function processes each test case by reading the necessary inputs, sorting the items, and using a heap to manage the selection process. The logic for calculating the maximum profit is sound and follows the rules described in the problem statement. The use of a heap to manage the selection of items for Bob to take for free is efficient and correct.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions collectively meet the requirements of the problem statement. The logic for handling the test cases, reading inputs, and calculating the maximum profit is correct.

Correctness: **True**
