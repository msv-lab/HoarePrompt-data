Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is an integer value of `b`, `a` is converted to an integer from the user input `a`, and the values of `t1`, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `b` are updated according to the new inputs `a` and `b`.**

In this case, the code simply converts the user input `a` to an integer. The values of `t1`, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
