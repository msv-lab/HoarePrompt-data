Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The value of `k` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The initial conditions for `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` are updated based on the input values.
