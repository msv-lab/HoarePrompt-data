Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); for each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq k, x \leq n\); and a list of n integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\) for all \(i\). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).**
