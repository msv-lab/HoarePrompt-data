Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be 0 after the loop executes.
- `m` will be less than or equal to 1.
- `arr[i - 1]` will be equal to `nums[0]` if no swap was made during the last iteration.
- `arr[i]` will be unchanged or adjusted according to the loop conditions.
- `ans` will be `False` if any swap was made during the iterations that caused `nums` to be unsorted, otherwise, it will remain `True` if no such condition was met.

Given the `print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])` statement, the output will depend on the value of `ans`.

- If `ans` is `True`, then the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` will evaluate to `'YES'`.
- If `ans` is `False`, then the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` will evaluate to `'NO'`.

Since the initial state indicates that `ans` will be `False` if any swap was made during the iterations that caused `nums` to be unsorted, and `True` otherwise, the print statement will output `'NO'` if a swap occurred, and `'YES'` if no swap occurred.

Output: **'NO'**
