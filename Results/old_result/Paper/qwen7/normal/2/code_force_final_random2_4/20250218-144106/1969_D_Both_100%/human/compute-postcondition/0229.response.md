Postcondition: **`max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` or remains 0; `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`; `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; `k` is less than or equal to 0; `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped; `removed_item` is the item that was heappushedpoped from the heap; `combined` is now one item shorter since the last item was popped.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `current_profit > max_profit` is true, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. In both cases (whether the condition is true or false), the other mentioned variables maintain their updated states as described.
