Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `sum_f` is equal to `f` since `sum_f` was not initialized before and `f` is an integer from the input, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `m` is the same as it was before, `a` is updated to the first integer from the input, `b` is updated to the second integer from the input, `f` is updated to the third integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f` respectively. The other variables (`sum_f`, `j`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
