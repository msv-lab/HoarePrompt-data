Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 33, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is 33, `lst` contains the value 3**

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 1 or 2, it will now be 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
