Output State: **`ans` is True, `m` must be a positive integer, `i` must be at least 0, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the last digit of `arr[i-1]`, and the list `nums` contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code converts each digit of `arr[i-1]` into an integer and creates a list `nums` from these integers, then appends the value of `arr[i]` to this list. Since `arr[i]` was initially less than `arr[i-1]`, now `arr[i]` is the last element in the list `nums`.
