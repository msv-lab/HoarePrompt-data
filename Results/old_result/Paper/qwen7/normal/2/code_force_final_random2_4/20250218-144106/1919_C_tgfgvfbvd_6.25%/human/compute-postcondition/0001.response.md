Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. Since no specific initial state was provided for `n` other than it being a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), the only change is that `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user. All other variables remain in their initial state, which in this case means they are not defined yet.
