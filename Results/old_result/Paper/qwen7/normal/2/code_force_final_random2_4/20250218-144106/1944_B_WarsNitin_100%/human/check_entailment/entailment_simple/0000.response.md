Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Array Splitting**: The array `a` is split into two halves `b` and `c`, where `b` contains the first `n` elements and `c` contains the next `n` elements. This is done correctly.

3. **Sorting**: Both `b` and `c` are sorted, which helps in identifying pairs of elements that have the same value.

4. **Initialization of `ans1` and `ans2`**: Two lists `ans1` and `ans2` are initialized to store the result.

5. **Populating `ans1` and `ans2`**:
   - For `ans1`, the program tries to add pairs of elements from `b` to match the required length `2k`.
   - For `ans2`, the program tries to add pairs of elements from `c` to match the required length `2k`.
   - If necessary, it uses elements from the list `l` to complete the required length.

6. **Ensuring Equal XOR**: The program ensures that the XOR of elements in `ans1` equals the XOR of elements in `ans2`. This is achieved by constructing `ans1` and `ans2` from the sorted halves `b` and `c`, respectively, and then using elements from `l` to balance any remaining differences.

7. **Output**: The program prints the constructed arrays `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for the given problem statement. The key steps ensure that the XOR condition is met by constructing the arrays from the sorted halves and balancing with elements from `l`.

Correctness: **True**
