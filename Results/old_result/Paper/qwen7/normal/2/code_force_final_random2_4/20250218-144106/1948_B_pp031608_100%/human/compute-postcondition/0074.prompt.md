Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is True, `m` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` is decremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input().
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is between 1 and `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr[i]` is either unchanged or adjusted such that if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, the elements of `nums` (which contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`) are checked for sorting. If they are not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If they are sorted, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is between 1 and `m-2`, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr[i]` is either unchanged or adjusted such that if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is between 0 and `m-3`, `m` must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr[i]` is either unchanged or adjusted such that if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to `False`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
