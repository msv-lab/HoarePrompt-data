Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is an input integer.
- `k` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

Here, the `math.ceil()` function is used to round up the result of `y / 2` to the nearest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Since the exact value of `y` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the expression `math.ceil(y / 2)`. However, we know that it will be the ceiling of `y / 2`.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of `y / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2)**
