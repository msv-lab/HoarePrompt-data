Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements processed. `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and is greater than `maxsize`. `tc` is incremented by the number of iterations the loop executed, which is equal to the length of the list `a`. `n` remains unchanged, and `t` remains unchanged. `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a` before any elements were potentially incremented within the loop.
