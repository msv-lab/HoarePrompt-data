Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `lex` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `info` is a list containing [26, 26, 26], `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `k < cases**.

This means that the `lex` variable has been updated to hold the integer value entered by the user through the `input()` function, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
