Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `k` is equal to 0
   - Additional postconditions: 
     - If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `b[i]` is appended to `l`.
     - If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `i` is set to 2, `k` is set to -2, and `ans1` contains the value of `b[2]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.

4. **Determine the new state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop runs until `i < n - 1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the other variables based on the loop logic**:
   - `k` remains 0 unless the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]` is met, but since `i` is incremented to 2, this condition will not be checked in the next iteration.
   - `ans1` is only set when `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, and since `i` is incremented to 2, `ans1` will not be affected in the next iteration.

6. **Finalize the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `k` remains 0.
   - No additional changes are needed for `b`, `l`, or `ans1` as they are not directly modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0**
