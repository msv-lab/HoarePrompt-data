You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `ap`, and `x` is updated according to the loop's logic for each iteration. Specifically, if `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`. If `x <= 0`, `x` remains unchanged. If `x == 0` and `y > 0`, `x` remains unchanged. If `x > 0` and `y == 0`, `x` is updated to `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If neither condition is met, `x` remains unchanged. The value of `bxsfory1` is calculated as 0 if `x <= 0` else the ceiling value of `x / 15` if `x > 0` and `y > 0`. The value printed in each iteration is either `bxsfory1 + bxsfory` if both `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `math.ceil(y / 2)` if `x == 0` and `y > 0`, `math.ceil(x / 15)` if `x > 0` and `y == 0`, or `0` otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the values of \(x\) and \(y\). If both \(x > 0\) and \(y > 0\), it calculates \(x\) as \(x - \text{ceil}(y / 2) \times 15 + y \times 4\) and prints \(\text{ceil}(x / 15) + \text{ceil}(y / 2)\). If \(x == 0\) and \(y > 0\), it prints \(\text{ceil}(y / 2)\). If \(x > 0\) and \(y == 0\), it prints \(\text{ceil}(x / 15)\). If neither condition is met, it prints \(0\). The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- The grid size is \(5 \times 3\) which means each screen can hold up to \(15\) icons (since \(5 \times 3 = 15\)).
- Icons of size \(1 \times 1\) occupy 1 cell.
- Icons of size \(2 \times 2\) occupy 4 cells.
- We need to minimize the number of screens required to fit all icons.

### Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases (`ap`), and for each test case, it processes the input values of `x` and `y`.
   - It calculates the number of screens needed based on the logic provided in the code.

2. **Key Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The logic seems to be trying to handle different cases where either `x` (number of \(1 \times 1\) icons) or `y` (number of \(2 \times 2\) icons) are non-zero.
   - The formula used is:
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` which calculates how many full screens can be filled by \(2 \times 2\) icons.
     - Adjustments are made to `x` to account for the space taken by \(2 \times 2\) icons.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` which calculates how many additional screens are needed for the remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons.
     - Finally, the total number of screens is calculated as `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If both `x` and `y` are zero, it prints `0`, which is correct.
   - If only `x` is non-zero, it correctly calculates the number of screens needed using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - If only `y` is non-zero, it correctly calculates the number of screens needed using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

### Testing the Program
Let's verify the logic with the example provided in the problem statement:

- For the first test case: \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 1 / 2 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons after placing \(2 \times 2\) icons: \(1 - 1 \times 4 = -3\) (no change since we can't have negative icons)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 0 / 15 \rceil = 0 \)
  - Total screens: \(1 + 0 = 1\)

- For the second test case: \(x = 7\), \(y = 2\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 2 / 2 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons after placing \(2 \times 2\) icons: \(7 - 1 \times 4 = 3\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 3 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(1 + 1 = 2\)

- For the third test case: \(x = 12\), \(y = 4\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
  - Remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons after placing \(2 \times 2\) icons: \(12 - 2 \times 4 = 4\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 4 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(2 + 1 = 3\)

- For the fourth test case: \(x = 0\), \(y = 3\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
  - Total screens: \(2\)

- For the fifth test case: \(x = 1\), \(y = 0\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 1 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(1\)

- For the sixth test case: \(x = 8\), \(y = 1\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 1 / 2 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons after placing \(2 \times 2\) icons: \(8 - 1 \times 4 = 4\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 4 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(1 + 1 = 2\)

- For the seventh test case: \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\)
  - Total screens: \(0\)

- For the eighth test case: \(x = 2\), \(y = 0\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 2 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(1\)

- For the ninth test case: \(x = 15\), \(y = 0\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 15 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(1\)

- For the tenth test case: \(x = 8\), \(y = 2\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 2 / 2 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons after placing \(2 \times 2\) icons: \(8 - 1 \times 4 = 4\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 4 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(1 + 1 = 2\)

- For the eleventh test case: \(x = 0\), \(y = 9\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 9 / 2 \rceil = 5 \)
  - Total screens: \(5\)
