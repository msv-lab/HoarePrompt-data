Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 'E', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is the input integer from the user, `m` is the input integer from the user, `s` is the input string from the user, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in the string `s` and includes the keys 'F', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E', the character 'i' is in the counter `hmp`.
Code of the loop:
for i in p:
    if i not in hmp:
        ans += m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF', and if `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` remains equal to `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEF'. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is equal to `m` plus whatever `ans` was before. Since there is no else part, the value of `p` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is equal to `m` plus whatever `ans` was before, since the condition `i not in hmp` is always true given the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
