Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), and `p`, a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer's absolute value is less than or equal to `n`. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` and updates it through a series of iterations, where each element in `dp` is updated based on the sum of its adjacent elements from the previous iteration, taken modulo `MOD`. After completing the iterations, it calculates `final_sum` as `p[-1] + offset` and returns the value of `dp` at this index.**
