Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all cases where the string `s` contains the substrings "pie" or "map". Specifically:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: 
   - The function checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie" and returns 1 if true. This is unnecessary and incorrect since the logic should focus on removing the minimum number of characters.
   - The function uses two separate loops to find and remove occurrences of "map" and "pie". However, this approach does not ensure that the removals are optimal (i.e., it may not always remove the minimum number of characters).

2. **Optimization Needed**:
   - The function should aim to remove the minimum number of characters by considering overlapping substrings. For example, if the string is "mappie", the current implementation would remove "map" and then "pie", resulting in two deletions. However, the optimal solution would be to remove only one character to make the string "mpie".

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - A more efficient way would be to use a single loop to traverse the string and keep track of the indices where "map" or "pie" start. Then, merge overlapping removals to minimize the total number of deletions.

Here's an improved version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    i = 0
    ans = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if i < len(s) - 2 and s[i:i+3] == 'map':
            ans += 1
            i += 3  # Skip the next 2 characters after 'map'
        elif i < len(s) - 2 and s[i:i+3] == 'pie':
            ans += 1
            i += 3  # Skip the next 2 characters after 'pie'
        else:
            i += 1
    return ans
```

This version ensures that overlapping substrings are handled efficiently, minimizing the number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
