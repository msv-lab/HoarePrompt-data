Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, but the condition for the loop to continue is based on the value of `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1.
   - `index` is increased by 16.
   - `path` is the value of `data[index]`.
   - `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`.
   - `n` is the value of `data[index]`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the value of `t`, we need to decrease `t` by 1 from its current value (which is greater than 0 and was decreased by 1 in the previous iteration).
   - `index` is increased by 16, so for the next iteration, it should be increased by another 16.
   - `path` and `results` are dependent on `data[index]` and the function call `func_1(path)`, respectively. For the next iteration, `path` will be the value of `data[index + 16]` and `results` will have a new element which is the return value of `func_1(data[index + 16])`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is set to `data[index]` and does not change within the loop.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is greater than 1 and decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 32, `path` is the value of `data[index]`, `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`**
