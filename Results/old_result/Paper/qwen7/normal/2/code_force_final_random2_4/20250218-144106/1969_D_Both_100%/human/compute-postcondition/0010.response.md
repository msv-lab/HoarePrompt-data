Output State: **`current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` must be a positive integer, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0; `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list of tuples called `combined` by combining elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses` using the `zip` function. The original values of `current_profit`, `test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `n`, `k`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged. The new variable `combined` is created and populated with pairs of elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`.
