Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and `ax`.**

Explanation: The line `ax = min(x, ax)` assigns to `ax` the minimum value between `x` and `ax`. Since `x` and `ax` are both input integers, `ax` will now hold the smaller of the two. The conditions and values of `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
