Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is updated to the list with its last element plus `i` plus 1, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is updated to 2 * `preOne[-1]`, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `oneInd` is assigned the value `2 * preOne[-1]`. Since `preOne` is unchanged, `oneInd` is now updated to twice the last element of `preOne`.
- All other variables (`el`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `preOne`, `ans`, `zeroInd`, `fi`, `n`, `ol`, and `zr`) remain in their original states as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
