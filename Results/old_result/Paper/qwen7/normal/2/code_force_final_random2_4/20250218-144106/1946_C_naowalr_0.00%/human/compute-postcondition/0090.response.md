Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `x` as the floor division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states. The values of `L` and `R` are still such that `R - L > 1`.
