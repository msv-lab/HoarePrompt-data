Output State: `i` is `-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `0` or less (since it starts as `k` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0), `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than or equal to `n`. After the first 3 iterations, `cnt` becomes `k - 3`. For the loop to finish executing all its iterations, `cnt` must eventually become 0. Given that `cnt` starts as `k` and decreases by 1 with each iteration, if the loop runs for all its iterations, `cnt` will reach 0 when `k` equals the number of iterations. Since we know from the given information that after 3 iterations, `cnt` is `k - 2`, and assuming the loop runs for all its iterations, `cnt` would be 0 after `k` iterations. Therefore, `k` must be the total number of iterations, which in this case would make `cnt` 0, ending the loop. Hence, `i` remains `-1`, and `l` remains `func_2() + 1` since `l` is only updated inside the loop and does not depend on the number of iterations but rather on the function `func_2()`.
