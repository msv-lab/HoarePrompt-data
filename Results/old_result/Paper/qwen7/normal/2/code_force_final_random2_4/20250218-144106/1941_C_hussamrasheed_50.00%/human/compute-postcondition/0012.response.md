Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `s` is updated to remove all occurrences of 'map'**.

Explanation: The code `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `p`). The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, and `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s` remains valid. The only change is that `s` now has all occurrences of 'map' removed.
