Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is `a[i + 2]`, and `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 2] - a[i + 1])**.

Explanation: The code sets `r` to `a[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` is `n - 1` and `i + 2` is `n`. Since `a` is a list of sorted integers, `a[i + 2]` is `r`. Also, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 2] - a[i + 1])`, which translates to `k` being decreased by `(n - 1) * (a[n] - a[n - 1])` because `a[i + 2]` is `a[n]` and `a[i + 1]` is `a[n - 1]`.
