Output State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `t` is increased by `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `t` is increased by `s`.**

Explanation: The code `t += s` increases the value of `t` by the current value of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the increase in `t` by `s`.
