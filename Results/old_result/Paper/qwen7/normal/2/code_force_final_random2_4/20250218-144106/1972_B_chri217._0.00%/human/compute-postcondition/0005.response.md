The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down. The function checks if the string `s` can be balanced such that every "U" has a corresponding "D" after it. If it can be balanced, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and determine if it can be balanced, returning 'YES' if it can and 'NO' if it cannot.
