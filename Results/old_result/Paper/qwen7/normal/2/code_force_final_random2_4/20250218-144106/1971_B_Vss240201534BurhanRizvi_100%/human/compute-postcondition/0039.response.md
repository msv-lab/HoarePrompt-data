Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s2` is a random permutation of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))` generates a new string `s2` which is a random permutation of the original string `s`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
