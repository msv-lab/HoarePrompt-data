Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `nabors` remains unchanged, but its condition is still valid, meaning it must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`) are now integers from the input.
