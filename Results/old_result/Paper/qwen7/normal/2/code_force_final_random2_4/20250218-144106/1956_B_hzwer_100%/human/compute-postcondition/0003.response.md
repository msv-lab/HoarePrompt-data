Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is assigned the value of an integer input from `sys.stdin.readline`, the list `a` contains `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the list at most 2 times, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`.**

In this output state, the variable `t` remains unchanged, `n` is updated to the integer value input from `sys.stdin.readline`, and the list `a` and the variable `input` remain in their original conditions.
