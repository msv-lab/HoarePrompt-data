Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Whether or not the elements in the slice `new` (from index 3 to the end of the original sequence) satisfy the conditions `check_all_new` (all elements are greater than or equal to their corresponding index) and `new_all` (all elements satisfy `(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new)))`, the program will exit the current loop or if statement.
