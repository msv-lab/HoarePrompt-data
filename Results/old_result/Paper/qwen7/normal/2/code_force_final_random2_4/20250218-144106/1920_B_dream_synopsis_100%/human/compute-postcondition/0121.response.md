Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` contains `[sums]`, and `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is already defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, the list `ans` now contains this value. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
