Output State: **`li` is a list with three elements: `a + k * c`, `a + k * c + d`, and `a + k * c + d * 2`, `h` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given that `h` is 2, the appended value is `a + k * c + d * 2`. The other variables (`a`, `k`, `c`, `d`, `h`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
