Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is unchanged, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is 2 times the last element of `suffZero`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 1) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)` subtracts the value of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from `oneInd`. Since `oneInd` was previously calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, after executing the code, `oneInd` becomes `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, which simplifies to `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
