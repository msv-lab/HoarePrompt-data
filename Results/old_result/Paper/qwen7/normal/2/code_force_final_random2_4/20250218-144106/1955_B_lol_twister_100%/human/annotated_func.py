#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9].
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: Output State: `li` is a list with `n` elements: `a + k * c`, `a + k * c + d`, `a + k * c + 2*d`, ..., `a + k * c + (n-1)*d`. The value of `n` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `li` will contain `n` elements where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. This means the list `li` will start with the value `a + k * c` and increment by `d` for each subsequent element, up to `n` elements in total. The variables `a`, `c`, `d`, and `k` retain their original values, and `h` is no longer used in the list construction but was incremented in the loop to reach `n-1`.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    #State: `li` is a sorted list with `n` elements: `a + k * c`, `a + k * c + d`, `a + k * c + 2*d`, ..., `a + k * c + (n-1)*d` and the list is not equal to `l`.
    return 'no'
    #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 500), `c` and `d` (integers between 1 and \(10^6\)), and a list `l` containing \(n^2\) integers each in the range [1, \(10^9\)]. It generates a new list `li` by calculating values based on `a` (the minimum value in `l`), `c`, `d`, and `k` (ranging from 0 to `n-1`). After sorting both `li` and `l`, the function checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.
