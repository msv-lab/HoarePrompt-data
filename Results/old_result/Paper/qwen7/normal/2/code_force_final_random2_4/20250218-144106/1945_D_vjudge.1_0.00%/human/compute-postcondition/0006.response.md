Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^3\) and \(\text{numero_testes} > 1\); `func_1()` has been called.**

The function `func_1()` has been called, but since no further details about its implementation are provided, we cannot specify changes to other variables. The precondition that `numero_testes` is an integer within the specified range remains unchanged.
