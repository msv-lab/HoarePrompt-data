Output State: **`no` must contain at least one element, the current value of `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value of the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value of the `big` list, `num` is `num - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is decremented by 1. Since the initial conditions for `no`, `i`, `less`, and `big` lists are unchanged, these conditions remain valid. The only change is that `num` is now one less than its original value.
