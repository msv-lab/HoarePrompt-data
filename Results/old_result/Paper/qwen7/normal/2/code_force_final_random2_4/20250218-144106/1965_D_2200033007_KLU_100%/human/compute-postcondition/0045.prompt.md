Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cts` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array, where 1 ≤ len(a) < 1000 and 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < len(a).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    sm = 0
    for j in range(i, len(a)):
        sm = sm + a[j]
        cts.append(sm)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a list, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `sm` at each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `sm` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `a` starting from index `i` to the last element of the list. The list `cts` will contain all the intermediate sums of `sm` at each step of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, `i` is an integer, `a` is a list, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `sm` for each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, `sm` will hold the total sum of elements from index `i` to the last element of the list `a`. The list `cts` will contain the cumulative sums of `sm` at each step of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` must be less than `len(a)`, `j` is `i + (number of iterations - 1)`, `sm` is the sum of all elements from index `i` to `i + (number of iterations - 1)` in the list `a`, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `sm` for each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will still be less than the length of the list `a`. The variable `j` will be equal to `i + (number of iterations - 1)`, meaning it will point to the last element considered in the summation process. The variable `sm` will hold the total sum of all elements from index `i` to the end of the list `a`. The list `cts` will contain the cumulative sums of `sm` at each step of the loop, starting from the sum of elements from `i` to `i + 1`, then including the next element, and so on until all elements from `i` to the end of the list are included.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
