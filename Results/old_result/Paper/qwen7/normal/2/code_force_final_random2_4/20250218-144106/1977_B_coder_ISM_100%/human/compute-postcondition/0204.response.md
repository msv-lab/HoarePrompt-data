Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for nalla in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `nalla` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 29
   - `length` is 30
   - The value of `s[29]` is '0' if `flag` was 1 initially, otherwise it remains '1'
   - All other characters in `s` remain unchanged

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `nalla = 0` to `nalla < t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nalla` must be less than `t`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` and `length` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `nalla` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again.
   - The value of `t` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**: After the loop increments `nalla` by 1, `nalla` will be 30 (assuming `t` is 30). For the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than 30.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than 30, and the value of `s[29]` is '0' if `flag` was 1 initially, otherwise it remains '1'. All other characters in `s` remain unchanged.**
