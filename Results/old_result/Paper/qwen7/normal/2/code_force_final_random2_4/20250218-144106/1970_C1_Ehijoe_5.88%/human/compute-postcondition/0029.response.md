Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `v` is not equal to `tree[-1]`; if `v` is equal to `tree[-1]`, then the last element of `tree` is now `u`; otherwise, if `u` is equal to `tree[0]`, then `tree` is now `[v, u]`; otherwise, `tree` now has one additional element which is `v`.
