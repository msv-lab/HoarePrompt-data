Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - `len(pans)` is at least 1, meaning `pans` is a non-empty list.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.
   - `s` is the last string input by the user, which is either '<' or '='.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 1.
- `pans` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.
- `mak` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value without additional information. However, since it is used twice in the print statement, it must refer to the same index in the list.

Given that `i` is 1, `pans[i]` will be `pans[1]`, which is the second element in the list `pans`.

Since `pans` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, the second element (`pans[1]`) will be 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `'?'`
- `pans[mak]` (which is the same as `pans[1]`, so it will be 1)
- `pans[mak]` (again, 1)
- `pans[i]` (which is `pans[1]`, so it will be 1)

Putting this together, the output will be:
Output: **'? 1 1 1 1'**
