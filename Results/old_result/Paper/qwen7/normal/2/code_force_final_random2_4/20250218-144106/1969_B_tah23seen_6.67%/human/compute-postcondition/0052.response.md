Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` + 3, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`**.

Explanation: The code `left += 1` increments the value of `left` by 1. Initially, `left` was equal to the length of the list `s` + 2. After executing the code, `left` becomes the length of the list `s` + 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
