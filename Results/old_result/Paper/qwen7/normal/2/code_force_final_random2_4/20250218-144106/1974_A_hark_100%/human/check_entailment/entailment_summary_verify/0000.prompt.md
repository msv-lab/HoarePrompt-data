You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
import math

func_1()

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the values of \(x\) and \(y\). If both \(x > 0\) and \(y > 0\), it calculates \(x\) as \(x - \text{ceil}(y / 2) \times 15 + y \times 4\) and prints \(\text{ceil}(x / 15) + \text{ceil}(y / 2)\). If \(x == 0\) and \(y > 0\), it prints \(\text{ceil}(y / 2)\). If \(x > 0\) and \(y == 0\), it prints \(\text{ceil}(x / 15)\). If neither condition is met, it prints \(0\). The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Let's consider the following example:

- For `x = 12` and `y = 4`, the program should calculate the minimum number of screens needed. However, the logic in the program is flawed.

The program attempts to handle different cases but does not correctly account for the placement of 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons. Specifically, the calculation for `bxsfory1` and the subsequent adjustments to `x` are incorrect.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of full 5x3 grids needed for the 2x2 icons and then determining how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of full 5x3 grids needed for 2x2 icons
        grids_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        # Calculate the remaining 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_1x1 = x - (grids_for_2x2 * 15)
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
        grids_for_1x1 = math.ceil(remaining_1x1 / 15)
        # Total number of screens needed
        total_grids = grids_for_2x2 + grids_for_1x1
        print(total_grids)

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons.
