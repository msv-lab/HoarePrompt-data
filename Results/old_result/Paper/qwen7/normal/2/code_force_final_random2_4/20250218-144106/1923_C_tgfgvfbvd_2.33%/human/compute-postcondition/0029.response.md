Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer and decreased by 1, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus the element at index `a - 2` of the list `p`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 1, and either the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))` is true, or `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1 or `s` is less than `2 * (b - a + 1)`.
