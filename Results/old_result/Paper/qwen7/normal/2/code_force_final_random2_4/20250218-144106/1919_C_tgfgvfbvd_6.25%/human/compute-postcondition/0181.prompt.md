Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `y` will be equal to `n-1`, `b` will be set to the first element in list `l` that is greater than its previous element (`l[y-1]`), and the loop will break out of the iteration where this condition is met. If no such element exists, `b` will retain its last assigned value. The other variables `n`, `x`, `c`, `a`, and `l` will remain in their final states from the initial or intermediate iterations.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `y` is a value such that after the loop runs, `y` will be `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 1`, and `l` is a list of elements. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1, and if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, `a` is set to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` hold true, and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` is satisfied, then `l[x]` is updated to `a` and `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` hold true, `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains unchanged. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` do not hold true, `b` is set to the first element in the list `l` that is greater than or equal to either `a` or `b`. If no such element is found, `b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, and `c` is increased by 1 if the element at index `n` in list `l` minus `a` is greater than the element at index `n` minus `b`. Otherwise, `b` is the element at index `n` in list `l` if neither of the above conditions is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `y` is `n - 1` and `x` is `n + 1`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `b` is the element at index `n` in list `l`. If `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `n + 1` in list `l`, then `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `b` is set to `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
