Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. Since the initial values of `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, and `x` are not changed by the code, they remain the same. The function `dfs(1, 1)` is called but its result is not specified, so `leftover` is left as the result of this function call.
