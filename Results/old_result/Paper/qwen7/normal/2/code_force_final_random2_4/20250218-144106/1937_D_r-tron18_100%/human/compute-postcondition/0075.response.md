Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` are unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]` - `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

Explanation: The code `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `ans[i]` will be updated to the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
