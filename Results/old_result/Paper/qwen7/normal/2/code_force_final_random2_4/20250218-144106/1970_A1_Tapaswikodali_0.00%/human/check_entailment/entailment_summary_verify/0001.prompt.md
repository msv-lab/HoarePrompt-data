You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` consisting only of '(' and ')' characters, ensuring it is a balanced parentheses sequence. It calculates the balance of parentheses at each position in the string and stores this information in a list of tuples. After sorting this list based on the balance values, it constructs a new string from the characters in `s` based on the sorted order and prints this new string. The final output is a string where the original characters are reordered according to their balance values during the iteration through the input string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to implement the "balanced shuffle" operation on a balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting based on these balances, and then reconstructing the sequence from the sorted data.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` using `input()`.

3. **Balance Calculation and Details Collection**:
   - The program iterates through each character in the string.
   - It calculates the balance of the prefix ending at each character.
   - It stores the balance, the negative of the index (to handle sorting in descending order), and the character itself in a list `details`.

4. **Sorting**:
   - The `details` list is sorted based on the balance values. If there's a tie, it uses the negative index to ensure the higher original positions come first.
   - Sorting with the balance in ascending order and the index in descending order ensures that the resulting sequence will have the required properties.

5. **Reconstructing the Result**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the final result by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list.
   - It uses a generator expression within `join` to create the final string.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the reconstructed string, which should be the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Verification:
Given the steps and the implementation, the program appears to correctly follow the algorithm described in the problem statement. Each part of the process (balance calculation, sorting, and reconstruction) aligns with the requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is implemented correctly according to the problem description.
