Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is 1.
   - `cost` is 2.
   - `right` is 1.
   - `s[0]` must not be '0'.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'` must be true.
   - Currently, `right` is 1, so `right < len(s)` is true if `len(s)` is greater than 1.
   - Additionally, `s[right]` must not be '0'. Since `right` is 1, `s[1]` must not be '0'.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `right` is incremented to 2 (or more) and `s[2]` (or the next character) is not '0'.
   - The length of `s` must be at least 2 to allow `right` to reach 2.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `right` should be 2.
- `s[1]` must not be '0'.
- `len(s)` must be at least 2.

Given these adjustments, the final state is:

State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is 2, `s[1]` must not be '0', and `len(s)` must be at least 2**
