Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is equal to `k + 2`, `k` is a positive integer at least 3, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not, `m` is a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 2, `m` is not equal to 1, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\) for all `i` in the range from 3 to `m`.**
