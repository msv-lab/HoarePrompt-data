Output State: **`final` is a list with one additional element `elem`, `pk` and `mini` are unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` adds the element `elem` to the list `final`. The other variables `pk`, `mini`, and `elem` remain unchanged. Therefore, `final` now contains all its previous elements plus the new element `elem`, while `pk` and `mini` retain their original values, and `elem` remains the next element in `lst`.
