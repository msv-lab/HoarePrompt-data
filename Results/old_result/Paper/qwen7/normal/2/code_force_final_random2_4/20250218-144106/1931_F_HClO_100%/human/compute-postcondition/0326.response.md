Output State: **`m` is 2 or less, `n` is an input integer, `a3` is a list of integers representing the values entered during each iteration of the loop, `l3` is a list of lists of integers also entered during each iteration, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and `_` is `m-1`**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. It does not affect the values of `a3`, `l3`, or `val`. The value of `m` is updated to the second input integer, which could be any integer. The value of `_` remains `m-1` based on the initial state.
