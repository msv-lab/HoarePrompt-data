Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters from one of the strings `x` or `y`, `b` is a list of characters from the input provided by the user, `f` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if f == 0:
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
            f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            f = 1
    elif a[i] > b[i]:
        a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is 0, and `f` is 1 if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, otherwise `f` is 0. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` is set to the previous value of `b[i]` and `b[i]` is set to the previous value of `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a[i]` and `b[i]` are elements from arrays `a` and `b` respectively. If `f` equals 0, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped. If `f` is 1 and `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, then `f` is set to 1, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` swap their values. If `f` is 1 and `a[i]` is not less than `b[i]`, `f` retains its original value and `a[i]` and `b[i]` keep their original values. If `f` is 1 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` is now equal to the original value of `b[i]` and `b[i]` is now equal to the original value of `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a[i]` and `b[i]` are elements from arrays `a` and `b` respectively. If `f` equals 0, swapping `a[i]` and `b[i]` occurs. If `f` is 1 and `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` swap their values, `f` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `f` is 1 and `a[i]` is not less than `b[i]`, `f` retains its original value, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` keep their original values. If `f` is 1 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `a[i]` is set to the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i]` is set to the original value of `a[i]`, `f` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
