Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is 0, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer. If `h` is 0, then `day` is 'AM' and `h` is 12. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If none of these conditions apply, `day` remains as 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.

After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` will be reduced to 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration. The values of `t`, `day`, `h`, and `m` will remain as they were last modified within the loop, with `h` adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 12 based on the given conditions.
