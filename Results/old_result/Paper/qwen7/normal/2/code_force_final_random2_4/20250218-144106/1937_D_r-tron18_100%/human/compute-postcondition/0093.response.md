Postcondition: `el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` remains unchanged, `suffZero` is updated to the list with its last element plus `i` plus 1, `preOne` remains unchanged, and `fi` and `n` remain unchanged. Depending on whether `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans` is either updated to the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` with `zeroInd` being `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` being 2 times the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`, or updated to the value of `zeroInd - oneInd` with `zeroInd` being calculated as 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` being updated to 2 * `preOne[-1]`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne` and `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
