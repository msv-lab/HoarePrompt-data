Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing one tuple, the first element of which is `a3` and the second element is `l3`.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts them to integers. The first element is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are collected into a list `l3`. The initial conditions for `m` and `val` remain unchanged.
