Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and the range it iterates over, which is `range(2)`. This means `j` will take values from 0 to 1.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition for `lex` and `arr` is given. We need to consider how these conditions might change or remain the same after one more iteration of the loop.

3. **Analyze the loop body**: Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine if it modifies `lex` or `arr`. However, the loop itself does not change the values of `lex` or `arr` directly; it only increments `j`.

4. **Determine the next state**: Since `j` ranges from 0 to 1, after one more iteration, `j` will be 1 if it was 0, or 0 if it was 1. The values of `lex` and `arr` will remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they remain as they were.

Given the above analysis, the states of `lex` and `arr` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lex` is an integer and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than 27, then `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), then `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 25. If `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive), then `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, then the value of `lex` and the state of `arr` remain unchanged.**
