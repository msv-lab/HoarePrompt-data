Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is a list containing 'no', `i` is 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `arr`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 because the code snippet is part of a larger context where `i` starts at 1 and is likely incremented before this line.
