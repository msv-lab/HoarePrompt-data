Output State: **The program returns False**

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the condition `i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]` is checked. Since it is mentioned that this condition remains false, the function will return False directly as specified in the code snippet. Therefore, the program returns False.
