Output State: **`s` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1 for each element `c` in `s`**.

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the integer `c` in the dictionary `cnt` for each element `c` in the list `s`. Since the list `s` must have at least one element for the loop to execute, the only updated state is that `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1 for each `c` in `s`. The initial state of `s` remains a list of integers with at least one element, and the updated state of `cnt` reflects the counts of the elements in `s`.
