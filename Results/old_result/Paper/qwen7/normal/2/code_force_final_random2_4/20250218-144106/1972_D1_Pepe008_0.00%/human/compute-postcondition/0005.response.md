Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer, `suma` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `suma` to 0. The values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from the initial state. The print statements and the logic involving the range and conditions are not executed yet, so no further changes occur to the variables.
