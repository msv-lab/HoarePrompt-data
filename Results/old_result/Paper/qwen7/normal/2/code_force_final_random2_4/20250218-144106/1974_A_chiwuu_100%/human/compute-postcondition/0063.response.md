Postcondition: **`t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is now equal to `b`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is now an integer value of the original `b`, `a` is an integer value from user input, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1 if t2 % 15 == 0, otherwise t is updated to `t + (t2 // 15)`**.
