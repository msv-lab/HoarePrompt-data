Output State: **The program returns a list `M` containing `w` and all integers from 2 to `w` that divide `q` and meet the specified conditions, along with any additional divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

This means that the list `M` includes:
- The value of `w`, which is the square root of `q` and is greater than or equal to 2.
- All integers `i` from 2 to `w` that divide `q` without a remainder.
- Any additional divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Since the loop has completed all its iterations and `i` is now set to the next integer greater than `w`, the list `M` contains all the required elements as per the given conditions.
