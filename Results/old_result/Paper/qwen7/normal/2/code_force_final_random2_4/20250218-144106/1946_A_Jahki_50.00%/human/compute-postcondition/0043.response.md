Postcondition: `op` is 3, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, and `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, where `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`. If `num2` is greater than 10000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
