Output State: **`a` is a list containing ['input1', 'input2', 'input3', 'input4'], `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` is 4, and `s` is 'input1input21', `t` is 1.**

The code `t = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `t`. Since no other operations were performed on `t` or any other variables, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables from the initial state along with the newly assigned value of `t`.
