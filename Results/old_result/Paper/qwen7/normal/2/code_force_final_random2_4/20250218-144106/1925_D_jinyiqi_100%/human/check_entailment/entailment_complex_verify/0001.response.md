### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided formula in the program does not accurately reflect the expected value as per the problem statement. Let's break down the issue and verify the correct approach.

#### Correct Approach:

To find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions, we need to consider the following:

1. **Probability of Choosing a Pair:**
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair in a single excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - Since the pairs are chosen independently, the expected value for each pair of friends is the sum of their friendship values multiplied by the probability of being chosen in each excursion.

2. **Effect of Repeated Selections:**
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent excursions.
   - The expected number of times a pair is chosen in \( k \) excursions is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected value contribution is the initial friendship value plus the expected number of times the friendship value increases.
   - The expected value for a pair of friends with initial value \( f \) is \( f + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

4. **Summing Over All Pairs:**
   - Sum the expected values for all pairs of friends to get the total expected value.

Given the above, the correct formula for the expected value \( E \) is:
\[
E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right)
\]
Where \( f_i \) is the initial friendship value of the \( i \)-th pair of friends.

#### Verification with the Given Example:

- **Test Case 2:**
  - \( n = 5 \), \( m = 2 \), \( k = 4 \)
  - Pairs: (1, 2, 25) and (3, 2, 24)

  - Sum of friendship values: \( 25 + 24 = 49 \)
  - Total unique pairs: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \)
  - Expected value for each pair: \( 49 + 4 \times \frac{1}{10} = 49 + 0.4 = 49.4 \)
  - Expected value for all pairs: \( 49.4 \times 2 = 98.8 \)

  - The expected value should be an integer, and the provided formula does not match the expected result.

### Conclusion:

The original program uses an incorrect formula, and the correct approach involves summing the expected contributions of each pair of friends. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
