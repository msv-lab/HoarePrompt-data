Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons. Let's break down why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for Mixed Icons:**
   - The logic `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates how many full 2x2 icons can fit, but then the subsequent calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` seems to incorrectly adjust the remaining space for 1x1 icons.
   - The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is not logically sound for determining the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons. It should simply subtract the space taken by 2x2 icons from the total space available and then see how many 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Space:**
   - The calculation `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` tries to determine how many 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space, but it doesn't account for the fact that the remaining space might not be a multiple of 15 (since a 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells).

3. **Simpler Correct Approach:**
   - A simpler and more accurate approach would be to:
     - Calculate how many full 2x2 icons can fit (`y // 4` since each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells).
     - Calculate the remaining space after placing these 2x2 icons.
     - Determine how many 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space (`math.ceil(remaining_space / 5)` since each 1x1 icon takes 1 cell and there are 5 rows).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of full 2x2 icons that can fit
        num_2x2_screens = y // 4
        # Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = (5 * 3) * num_2x2_screens - y * 4
        # Calculate how many 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space
        num_1x1_screens = math.ceil((x - remaining_space) / 5)
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = num_2x2_screens + num_1x1_screens
        print(total_screens)

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program accurately calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons.
