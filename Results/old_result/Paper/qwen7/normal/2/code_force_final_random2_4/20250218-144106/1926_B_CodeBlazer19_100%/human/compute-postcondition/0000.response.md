Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `t` is set to the integer input value.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial condition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 remains valid, but now `t` specifically holds the value of the integer input. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
