Postcondition: `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length `2 * n + 1`, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, provided that `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `dp[j] > 0`, and `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.
