Output State: **`t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state of `t` being 1 and `val` containing `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still 1, and the structure of `val` is preserved.
