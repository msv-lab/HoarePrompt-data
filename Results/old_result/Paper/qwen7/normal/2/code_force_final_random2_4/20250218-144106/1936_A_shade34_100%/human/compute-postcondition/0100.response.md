Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `mak` is 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - If the input string is "<", then `mak` remains 3.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, and `i` is currently 3, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, so `i` will become 4 in the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Post-Iteration State**:
   - `mak` remains 1 because there is no information suggesting it changes within the loop.
   - `i` becomes 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3**
