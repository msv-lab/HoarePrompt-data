Output State: **`ans` is 0 + max(0, `x` - 1), `cnt` must have at least one element**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding `max(0, x - 1)` to its current value. Since `ans` initially is 0, the new value of `ans` will be `max(0, x - 1)`. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.
