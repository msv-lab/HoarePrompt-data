Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, where each case involves an integer `lex`. For each `lex`, it constructs an array `arr` based on certain conditions, appends `lex` to `arr`, sorts `arr`, and stores the result in a list `info`. Finally, it prints a string composed of characters corresponding to the first three elements of the sorted array for each case.**
