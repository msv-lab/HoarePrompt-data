Postcondition: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is equal to `k - 1`, and `n` is equal to `k - 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. Whether the condition `h < k` is true or false, the final values of `costs`, `h`, and `n` remain consistent as described.
