Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
