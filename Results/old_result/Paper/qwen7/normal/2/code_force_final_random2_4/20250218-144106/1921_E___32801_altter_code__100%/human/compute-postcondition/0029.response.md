Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1 or r[2] + a, `y1` is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1, `x2` is r[4], `y2` is r[5], `x2` is greater than `x1`, and (x2 - x1) is odd, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `t` is abs(r[5] - r[3]).**

Explanation: The value of `x1` is incremented by `a`. Since `a` is not specified, we keep it as `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are still valid.
