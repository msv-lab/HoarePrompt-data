Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` elements. The first element of `dp` is either `1` or `-inf` depending on the first character of `path`. The second element of `dp` is `dp[0] + 1` if the second character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is `dp[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, n):
    if path[i] == '*':
        dp[i] = -float('inf')
    else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `path`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is either `1` or `-inf` depending on the first character of `path`, and the second element is `dp[0] + 1` if the second character of `path` is `@`, otherwise `dp[1]` remains the same as `dp[0]`. If the third character of `path` is '*', `dp[2]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[2]` is the maximum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0]` plus 1 if the third character of `path` is `@`, otherwise it remains the same as the maximum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `dp[i]` is updated based on the value of `path[i]`. If `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is set to -infinity. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', or simply the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` if `path[i]` is not '@'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `dp[i]` is updated based on the value of `path[i]` where `i` is `n-1`. If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[i]` is updated to `-float('inf')`. Otherwise, if `path[i]` is '@', `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1. If `path[i]` is any other character, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
