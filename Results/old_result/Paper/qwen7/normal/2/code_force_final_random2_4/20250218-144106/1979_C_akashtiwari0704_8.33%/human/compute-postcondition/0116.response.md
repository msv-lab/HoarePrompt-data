Postcondition: **If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then `bets` is at least the total number of iterations in the loop, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by each element in `a` for all iterations, and each element in `a` is updated to the result of `prod // a[i]` for its respective index. Otherwise, `bets` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a string containing the elements of the list `a`, separated by spaces.**
