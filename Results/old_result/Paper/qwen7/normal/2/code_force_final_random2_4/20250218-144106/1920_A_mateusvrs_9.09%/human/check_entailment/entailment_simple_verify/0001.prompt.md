You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, indicating the type of constraint and the value x respectively. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

    #State: Output State: After all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. `r` will be a list containing the cumulative results from each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the corresponding entry in `r` will be 0. Otherwise, it will be `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. The variables `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` will no longer be used and can be considered as having been processed and reset within each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function initializes `t` with the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of constraints.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store values of `x` where `a = 3` (i.e., `k` must not be equal to `x`).
   - Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to handle the bounds of `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If `a = 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If `a = 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If `a = 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

3. **Validation and Calculation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there are no valid `k` values, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of elements in `cx` within the range `[bx+1, ax-1]` from the total possible values `(ax - bx - 1)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:

- The logic correctly handles the constraints and ensures that only valid `k` values within the specified range are considered.
- The use of sets to store values of `x` for `a = 3` constraints helps in efficiently checking which values should be excluded.
- The calculation of the number of valid `k` values is accurate based on the constraints provided.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints.
