Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and the current value of `k` is either -2 or 0, depending on whether the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` is true or false. If the condition is true, `ans2` contains the value of `c[i]` which is equal to the current value of `c[i - 1]` and `ans2` has appended this value. If the condition is false, `ans2` remains unchanged.
