Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 32`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the code execution. All other variables remain unchanged and are not affected by the code.
