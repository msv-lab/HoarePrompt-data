Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `a3` is an integer read from input, `l3` is a list of integers read from input, `l` is either `l1` or a list equal to `l2` depending on whether `l3.index(a3)` is less than `l3.index(a2)` or not, and `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `m` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the variable `m` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial states or conditions specified in the initial state.
