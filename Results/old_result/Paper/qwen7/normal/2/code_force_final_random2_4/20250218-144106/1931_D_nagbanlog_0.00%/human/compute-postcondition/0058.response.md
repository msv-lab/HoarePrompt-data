Output State: **`a` is case['array'], `mod_x` is num % x, `mod_y` is num % y, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x**

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `mod_x`, or `mod_y`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `required_mod_x` is assigned the value of `(x - mod_x) % x`.
