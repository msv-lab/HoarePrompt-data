Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `r` is the input string from the user, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, `prev` is `i` (which is 3)**.

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 3) to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
