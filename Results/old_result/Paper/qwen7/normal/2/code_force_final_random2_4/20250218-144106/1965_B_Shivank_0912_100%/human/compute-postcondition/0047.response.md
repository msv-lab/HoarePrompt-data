Output State: **`j` is 1, `20` is 20, and `ans` is a list containing the values [1, 2]**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 1, `1 << j` equals `1 << 1`, which is 2. So, the list `ans` now contains the values [1, 2]. The values of `j` and `20` remain unchanged.
