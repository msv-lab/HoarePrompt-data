Output State: **`final` is a list containing `elem`, `lst` must contain at least one element, `pk` and `mini` are such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. The initial state of `final` is an empty list, so after appending `elem`, `final` becomes a list containing `elem`. The other variables (`lst`, `pk`, and `mini`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
