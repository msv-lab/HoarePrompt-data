The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so now `i` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 4 if `temp * 2 < k` is true, otherwise `temp` remains 2.

Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 4 if `temp * 2 < k` is true, otherwise `temp` remains 2.**
