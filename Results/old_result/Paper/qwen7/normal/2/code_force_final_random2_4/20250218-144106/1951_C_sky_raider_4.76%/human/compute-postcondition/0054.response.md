Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**

The code `s = min(m, k)` assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to the variable `s`. Since the initial values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this line of code, they remain the same. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid. The value of `s` is determined by comparing `m` and `k`, but since their specific values are not provided, `s` is expressed as the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
