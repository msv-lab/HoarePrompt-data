You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed for all values of `t` from 0 to `T-1`. Therefore, `t` will be equal to `T-1`. The variable `T` remains as the initial positive integer provided. The variable `info` remains unchanged, holding the list of strings split from the input. The variable `a` remains as the first element of `info` converted to an integer. The variable `b` remains as the second element of `info` converted to an integer. The variable `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop's iterations for each `t` from 0 to `T-1`, where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for all `i` in the range 1 to `b`. After all iterations, `suma` will be printed, followed by `suma - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the formula involving \( a \) and \( b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are derived from \( n \) and \( m \). Specifically, it computes the sum of certain terms \( x \) for each \( i \) in the range from 1 to \( b \), where \( x \) is determined by the condition \( a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0 \). Finally, it prints the computed sum minus one for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Loop Over Test Cases**:
   - It iterates over each test case.
   - For each pair `(a, b)`, it initializes a variable `suma` to store the count of valid pairs.

3. **Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The inner loop runs from `1` to `b`.
   - For each value of `i` in this range, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than `0`, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

### Key Points to Check

1. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula used in the program is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - This formula seems to be derived from a specific logic, but let's check if it correctly counts the valid pairs.

2. **Condition Verification**:
   - The condition `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The program does not directly check this condition. Instead, it uses a different approach which might not be equivalent.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The given solution appears to use a different method to count the pairs, which might not be accurate.
   - The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not seem to directly relate to the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`. The provided solution uses a different approach that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.
