Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` equals 0, and `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` appended with `b[i]`, which is `b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 1, `b[i]` is `b[1]`. Therefore, `b[1]` is appended to `ans1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
