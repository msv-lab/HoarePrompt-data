Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `n` is 0, `ax` is `x` if `x` < `a`, otherwise `a`.**

Explanation: The line `ax = min(x, ax)` assigns to `ax` the minimum value between `x` and `ax`. Since `ax` is initially undefined, it is treated as if it were `a` (an input integer). Therefore, `ax` will be assigned the smaller of `x` and `a`. The values of `a`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.
