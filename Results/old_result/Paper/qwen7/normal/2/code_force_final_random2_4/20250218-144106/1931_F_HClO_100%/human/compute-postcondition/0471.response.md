Output State: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from each input converted to int, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from each input converted to int, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples: each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `m-2` times), the variable `m` will be greater than 2, `a3` will hold the first integer from each of the `m-2` inputs provided, `l3` will be a list of the remaining integers from each of these inputs, all converted to integers, and `val` will be a list containing `m-2` tuples, with each tuple consisting of an `a3` and corresponding `l3`.
