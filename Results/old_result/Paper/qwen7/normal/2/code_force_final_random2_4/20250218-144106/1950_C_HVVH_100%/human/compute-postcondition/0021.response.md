Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'PM' or remains 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 12, and `m` is an input integer. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` changes to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM', and `h` is set to 12.
