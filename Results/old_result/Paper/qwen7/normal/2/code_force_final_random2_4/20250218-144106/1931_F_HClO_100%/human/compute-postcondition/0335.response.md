Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and the expression `range(m - 2)`. The variable `_` is used as the loop variable, but it is not directly used inside the loop body (since the body is omitted). The loop will execute if `m - 2` is a positive number.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, `m - 2` must be greater than 0. Given that `m` is 2 or less, the only way `m - 2` can be greater than 0 is if `m` is exactly 2. Therefore, `m` must be 2 for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above reasoning, we need to adjust the state such that `m` is 2. The other variables (`n`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `_`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`) do not affect the condition for the loop to execute and can remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`m` is 2**
