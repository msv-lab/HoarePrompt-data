Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `a` is `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, otherwise `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0` and `y1` is not equal to `y2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between `x2` and `x1` and assigns it to `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition that `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0` and `y1` is not equal to `y2` remains true. The value of `a` is determined based on the condition given, and now `b` holds the value of `x2 - x1`.
