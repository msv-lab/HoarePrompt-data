Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are modified within the loop or if statement, their previous values remain unchanged. The value of `temp` is set to 2 because the condition `temp * 2 < k` is false (as `temp` is initially 4 and `k` is the second element of `l1`, which is an integer).
