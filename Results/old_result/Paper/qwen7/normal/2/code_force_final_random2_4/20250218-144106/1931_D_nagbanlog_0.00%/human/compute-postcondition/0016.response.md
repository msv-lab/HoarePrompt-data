Postcondition: `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]` if the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is present in `freq`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged. `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
