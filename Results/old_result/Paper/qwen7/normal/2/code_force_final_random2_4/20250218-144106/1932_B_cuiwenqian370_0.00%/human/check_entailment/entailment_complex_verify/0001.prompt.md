You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Specifically, `dp[i]` will be `-float('inf')` if `path[i]` is '*', and otherwise, `dp[i]` will be the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', or simply the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` if `path[i]` is any other character.

    #The program returns the maximum value among the elements in `dp` that are not equal to `-float('inf')`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `path` consisting of '@' and '*' characters. It calculates a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element depends on the previous elements based on the characters in `path`. If a character in `path` is '*', the corresponding `dp` element is set to `-inf`. If the character is '@', the `dp` element is incremented from the previous two elements. Finally, the function returns the maximum value among the `dp` elements that are not `-inf`. If no valid sequence exists, it returns 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs, and path is a space-separated string containing n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.

        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: `t` must be 0 or less; `index` is increased by 51 (since 3 times 17 equals 51); `path` is the value of `data[index]`; `results` is a list with three additional elements which are the return values of `func_1(data[index])` for each iteration; `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `n` is an integer.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` must have exactly three elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (number of signs), and a string `path` containing space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs. For each test case, it calls `func_1(path)` to process the `path` string and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not match the problem description at all. The problem involves calculating the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicity. However, the code provided is trying to solve a different problem, likely related to dynamic programming or string processing.
2. The function `func_1` takes a list `path` as input, which seems to be unrelated to the problem's requirements. It uses characters like `@` and `*` and calculates some kind of dynamic programming solution, but this is not relevant to the given problem.
3. The function `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` with each test case. Again, this function is not solving the problem correctly because `func_1` is not designed to handle the problem's requirements.

Given that the provided functions do not implement the logic required to solve the given problem, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
