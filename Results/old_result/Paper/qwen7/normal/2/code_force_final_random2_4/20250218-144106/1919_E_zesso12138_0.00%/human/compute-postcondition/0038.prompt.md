You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is increased by the sum of all `n` values encountered during the loop iterations, `t` is 0 (since it decreases by 1 each iteration and starts from a value greater than 0), `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, appended with `result` for each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `index` will point to the position right after the last processed segment of the `data` list, `t` will be 0 as it has been decremented to zero, `p` will contain all integers from the specified segments of `data` concatenated together, `data` remains unchanged, `results` will be a list of all the results returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: All iterations of the loop have finished, resulting in `results` being a list containing the return values from `func_1(n, p)` for every segment of integers extracted from `data`. The `index` variable points to the position immediately following the last segment of integers processed, `t` is 0, `p` contains all integers from the specified segments of `data` concatenated together, `data` remains unchanged, and `results` is a comprehensive list of all the results returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), n (a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a), and p (a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order). The function does not return any value based on the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
