Output State: **`sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` is an input integer, `prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets - 1`, `T` is `T + 1`, and `t` remains unchanged, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. This list replaces the existing `a` list. The other variables (`sumo`, `i`, `bets`, `prod`, `T`, and `t`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values, but `a` now holds the new list of integers.
