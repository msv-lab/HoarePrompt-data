Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is `k + 2`, `k` must be at least 3, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not, `m` is a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 2, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\) for all `i` from 3 to `m`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set, `i` will be `k + 2` since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, and the loop runs until `i` reaches `m + 1`. The value of `k` must be at least 3, and `c` and `r` are still the input integers from the split. The variable `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 depending on the condition in the loop, `m` is calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 2 and not equal to 1. The list `dp` is updated according to the given formula for each index from 3 to `m`, with all calculations done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
