Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 2, `path` is the value of `data[index]`, `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`**.

This means that `t` is now one less than its original value, `index` has been increased by 2, `path` remains as the value of `data[index]`, the results list now contains a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`, and `n` is set to the value of `data[index]`.
