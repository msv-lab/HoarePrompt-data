Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the program should output "YES" followed by 1 and 1 because Alice can buy 3 jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin each.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 4`, the program should output "NO" because Alice cannot buy 4 jewels with only 6 coins.
   - For `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program should output "YES" followed by 8 and the list of prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`.

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program starts by checking if `n` equals `k`. If true, it prints "YES", 1, and 1 and returns `n`.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `k` using specific costs `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
     - It then checks if the sum of these operations (`h`) is less than `k`. If true, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, "YES", and the list of costs.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The logic for determining the number of stalls and their prices is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the greedy buying process of Alice across multiple stalls.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of operations can always be achieved with just two stalls, which is not necessarily true.
   - The program does not handle the scenario where Alice needs to buy exactly `k` jewels across multiple stalls with different prices.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - The program should simulate the process of Alice buying jewels from multiple stalls with different prices.
   - It should ensure that the total number of jewels bought equals `k`.
   - The program should correctly handle the case where it is impossible to achieve exactly `k` jewels.

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
