Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, the current value of `k` is -2, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `ans2` contains the value of `c[i]` which is equal to the current value of `c[i - 1]` and `ans2` has appended this value.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, making it `-2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
