Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 29, `length` is 30, and the value of `s[29]` is '0' if `flag` was 1 initially, otherwise it remains '1'. All other characters in `s` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: Given the loop iterates from `i = 1` to `length - 1`, and considering the loop has executed 3 times, it means the loop will continue until `i` reaches 29 (since the loop increments `i` each time it runs). During each iteration, the condition checks if `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i-1]` is '1'. If both conditions are met, `s[i]` is changed to '0' and `s[i-1]` is changed to '-1'. However, based on the provided information, the loop has not encountered such a pair yet (as it only ran 3 times), so no changes were made to `s`. Therefore, the final state of `s` depends on its initial state: if `flag` was 1 initially, `s[29]` would be '0'; otherwise, it remains '1'. The value of `i` is 29 because the loop has completed all iterations up to `i = 29`, and `length` remains 30 as it was not modified within the loop.
