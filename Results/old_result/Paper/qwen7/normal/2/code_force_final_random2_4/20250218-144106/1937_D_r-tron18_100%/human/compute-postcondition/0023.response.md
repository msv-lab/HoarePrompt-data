Output State: **`el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is shortened by removing the last element, `ans[i]` is calculated as follows: if `ol <= zr`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.**

Explanation: The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. All other variables (`el`, `ol`, `zr`, `ans[i]`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `n`, `fi`, and `suffZero`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
