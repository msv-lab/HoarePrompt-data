Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input for the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Diagonal Check**: The program correctly counts the number of rooks placed on the main diagonal (`num`). This is done by checking if `c == r` for each pair `(r_i, c_i)`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The program initializes the dynamic programming array `dp` correctly with base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The recurrence relation used is correct, and it correctly updates the `dp` array for larger values of `m`.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The program ensures that all calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is necessary to handle large numbers.

5. **Final Output**: The program correctly prints the value of `dp[m]`, which represents the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic and implementation appear to be correct. The program follows the specified rules and correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations.

Correctness: **True**
