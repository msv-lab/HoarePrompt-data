### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\),
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a nested loop approach. However, the formula used inside the loop does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Here's the problematic part of the program:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
        suma += x
```

This formula \(x = (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, it does not properly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition directly:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)
```

This approach iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring that the correct number of valid pairs is counted.

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the formula involving \( a \) and \( b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are derived from \( n \) and \( m \). Specifically, it computes the sum of certain terms \( x \) for each \( i \) in the range from 1 to \( b \), where \( x \) is determined by the condition \( a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0 \). Finally, it prints the computed sum minus one for each test case.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
