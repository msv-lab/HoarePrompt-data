Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `right < len(s)` will no longer be satisfied because `right` will eventually become equal to or greater than the length of `s`. This means the loop terminates when `right` is no longer less than the length of `s` or when `s[right]` becomes '0'. Since the loop increments `right` by 1 each time it executes and does not change the value of `right` when the condition is no longer met, the final value of `right` will be equal to the length of `s`. The other variables (`sChar`, `i`, `s`, `left`, and `cost`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's condition or body.
