### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary against the problem description and the required output.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from standard input.
   - It constructs a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase letters from the predefined string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`.
   - It then repeats this substring `n` times and returns the result.

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program constructs a string by repeating the first `k` lowercase letters `n` times.
   - For example, for \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), the string generated is `"abcabc"`.
   - This string does not necessarily contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters.

3. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The goal is to find a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - The string should have the smallest possible length, and among those with the same length, any one can be chosen.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The provided program does not meet the requirement because it simply repeats the first `k` letters `n` times, which does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters will be present.
   - For instance, for \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), the string `"abcabc"` does not contain `"ba"`, `"ca"`, and `"cb"` as subsequences.

5. **De Bruijn Sequence Consideration**:
   - A de Bruijn sequence for alphabet size \( k \) and length \( n \) is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length \( n \) appears exactly once as a substring.
   - Constructing such a sequence is necessary to ensure all required subsequences are present.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly generate a string that meets the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
