You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). After all iterations, for each iteration, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and the condition `n - k <= 1` is checked. If the condition is true, `n` is printed; otherwise, `1` is printed.
    #
    #This means that after all the iterations, the final output will be a series of numbers, either `n` or `1`, depending on whether `n - k <= 1` was true for each pair of inputs `(n, k)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers n and k within specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2) as part of its input through a test case structure where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 test cases are considered. It returns a value based on the relationship between n and k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
