Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `r` is an input string from the user.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n - 1`.
   - `v2` is `n - 1`.
   - `prev` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `r` equals `>` or not.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (at least 2).

6. **Other states**:
   - `r`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `prev` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `r` is an input string from the user, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `r` equals `>` or not.**
