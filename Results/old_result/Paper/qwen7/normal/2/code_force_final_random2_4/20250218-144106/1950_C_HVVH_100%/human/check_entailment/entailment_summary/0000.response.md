Reasoning:
- The program is designed to convert a 24-hour format time to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.
- The program correctly handles the conversion logic:
  - If the hour `h` is 0, it converts it to 12 and sets `day` to 'AM'.
  - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
  - Otherwise, it sets `day` to 'AM', and if `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'.
- The program uses formatted string printing to ensure that the hours and minutes are always displayed with two digits.
- However, there is an issue with the loop counter `n` being set to 0 at the end of the function, which is not part of the required functionality. This does not affect the correctness of the time conversion but is unnecessary and could be removed.
- Despite this minor issue, the core functionality of converting the time to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
