Output State: `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, the first element of `a` is -1000000000.0, the second element of `a` is any value, the third element of `a` is any value, the fourth element of `a` is any value, `b` is a list where each element is the sum of the previous two elements plus `v` if certain conditions are met during each iteration of the loop.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `a` will still be a list starting with -1000000000.0 and having at least four elements. The variable `b` will be a list where each element from the third onward is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop: specifically, each element `b[i]` (for `i >= 2`) is updated by adding `b[i-2] + v` if `v > x - w` and `b[i-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, where `v = y - x`. The initial elements of `b` are [0, 0].
