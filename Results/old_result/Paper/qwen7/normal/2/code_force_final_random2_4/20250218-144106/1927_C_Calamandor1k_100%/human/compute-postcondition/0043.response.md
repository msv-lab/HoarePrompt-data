Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.
- `results` list now contains 'YES'.

### Loop Head
```
for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `(n, m, k, a, b)` and `cases`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `cases` list.
3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has processed one element from the `cases` list. Therefore, `cases` must have at least one element left for the loop to execute again.
4. **Adjusting States**: We need to ensure that `cases` has at least one element left for the loop to continue.

### Updated State
- `total_distinct` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop head.
- `results` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop head.
- `cases` must have at least one element left for the loop to execute again.

### Final State
State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list now contains 'YES', `cases` must have at least one element**
