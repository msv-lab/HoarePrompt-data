Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is 1, and `s[0]` must not be '0'**.

The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` is 0, so after executing this line, `right` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
