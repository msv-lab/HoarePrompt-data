Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k`, `l` is `n + 4`, `cnt` is 0**.

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called but its exact behavior is not specified. However, the only change to the variable `l` is that it is updated to `n + 1` before the call to `func_2()`. Since no other changes are made to `l`, `n`, `i`, `k`, or `cnt`, these variables retain their initial values. The only update to `l` is that it is now `n + 4` after the call to `func_2()`, assuming `func_2()` did not modify `l` and the number of iterations was 3 (since `3 * (number of iterations)` added 3 to the original `n + 1` to make `n + 4`).
