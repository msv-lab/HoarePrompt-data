Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the elements of the list `a`. Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `num` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` will take each element from the list `a` one by one during the loop iterations.
   - `a` is already defined as `case['array']`.

3. **Check the initial state of `a`**:
   - `results` is a list containing 0, but this is not directly relevant to the loop head.
   - `mod_y` and `mod_x` are derived from the last `num` (from the new `case`), but since the loop hasn't started yet, they are not relevant to the initial state needed for the loop to execute.
   - `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are also derived from the last `num`, and thus not relevant to the initial state needed for the loop to execute.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from `case['params']`, but these are not part of the loop head.
   - `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`, so it is already defined.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `a` is already defined as `case['array']`, no adjustment is needed for `a`.
   - `num` will take the first element of `a` in the first iteration of the loop, so we don't need to adjust its initial state; it will be set by the loop itself.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` being defined as `case['array']`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is case['array']**
