Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `y` is equal to `n-1`, `x` is equal to `n`, `c` is 0, `a` is now `l[0]`, `b` is 0, and `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The line `c = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
