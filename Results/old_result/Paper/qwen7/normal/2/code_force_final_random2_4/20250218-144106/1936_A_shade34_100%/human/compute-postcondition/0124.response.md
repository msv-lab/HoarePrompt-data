Output: **?, 1, n-1, 1, n-1**

Explanation:
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is greater than 1 but its exact value is not specified, so it remains as `n`.
- `mak2` is explicitly given as `n-1`.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `mak2` is explicitly given as `n-1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the values of these variables and objects in the order they are referenced in the print statement.
