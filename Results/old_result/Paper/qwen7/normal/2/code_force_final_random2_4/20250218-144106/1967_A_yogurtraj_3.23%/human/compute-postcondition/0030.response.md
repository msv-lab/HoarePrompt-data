Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `rem` to be the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `i + 1` is `n`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
