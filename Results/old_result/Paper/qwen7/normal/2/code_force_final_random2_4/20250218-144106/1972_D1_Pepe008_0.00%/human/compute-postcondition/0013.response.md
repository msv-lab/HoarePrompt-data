Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` is `b`, `x` is `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1) ** 2 + 1**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`. The value of `b` remains unchanged. The value of `x` is calculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, but since `i` is now `i + 1`, the formula becomes `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1) ** 2 + 1`. The other variables remain in their initial state.
