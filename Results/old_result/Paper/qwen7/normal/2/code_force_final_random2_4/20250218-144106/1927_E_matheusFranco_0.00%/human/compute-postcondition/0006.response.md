Output State: **`t` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The initial state is that `t` must be greater than 1. After executing `t -= 1`, `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially greater than 1, decrementing it by 1 results in a value that is still greater than 0, but not necessarily greater than 1 anymore. Therefore, the updated condition is that `t` is greater than 0.
