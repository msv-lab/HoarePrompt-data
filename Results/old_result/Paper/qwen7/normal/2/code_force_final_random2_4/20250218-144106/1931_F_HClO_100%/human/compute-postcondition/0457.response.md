Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and either `val` is an empty list with the element at index `idx2` in `l1` updated with `a1`, or `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `m` equals 1, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` (with `idx1` being less than or equal to `idx2`), `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, and `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers.
