Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(numero_testes):`. The only variable mentioned here is `numero_testes`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `numero_testes` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial state given**: The initial state is that `numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero\_testes} \leq 10^4\), and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on `numero_testes`, we need to ensure that `numero_testes` is greater than 0. Given the constraint \(1 \leq \text{numero\_testes} \leq 10^4\), we know that `numero_testes` will always be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `numero_testes` itself.

5. **Final state**: The only variable involved in the loop head is `numero_testes`, and since it is guaranteed to be greater than 0, no additional adjustments are necessary beyond ensuring it meets its initial constraint.

Thus, the state before the loop starts remains as given, but we need to explicitly state that `numero_testes` is within the specified range and greater than 0.

**State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero\_testes} \leq 10^4\) and \(\text{numero\_testes} > 0\)**
