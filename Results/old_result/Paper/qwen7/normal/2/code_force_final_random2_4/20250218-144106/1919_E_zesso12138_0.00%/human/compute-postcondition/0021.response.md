Output State: **`index` is 5 + `data[index]` + `data[index]`, `n` is an integer value equal to `data[index]`, `t` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + data[index] - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` appended with `result`, and `results.append(result)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` converts the string value at index `index` in the list `data` to an integer and assigns it to `n`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
