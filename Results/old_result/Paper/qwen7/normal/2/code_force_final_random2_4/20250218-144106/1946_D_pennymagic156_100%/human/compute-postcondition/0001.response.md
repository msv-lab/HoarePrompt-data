Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and `a` is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, and `a` is the result of the function `func_1()`**.

Explanation: The code `a = func_1()` assigns the result of the function `func_1()` to the variable `a`. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their previous states. The precondition that `a` is a list of `n` integers, each between 0 and \(2^{30} - 1\), remains valid, but now `a` is specifically the output of `func_1()`.
