Output State: **`test_cases` must be a positive integer, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `prices` is a list containing the return values of `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The line `prices = list(func_2())` calls the function `func_2()` and assigns its return values to the variable `prices`. Since `func_2()` returns two values (as indicated by `n` and `k`), `prices` will be a list containing these return values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
