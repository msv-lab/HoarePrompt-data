Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is equal to `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(
        f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
        )
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is now present in `freq` plus one occurrence.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `beautiful_count` is incremented by 1, `mod_y` remains the same, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` remains the same, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is now present in `freq` with a frequency of 2 if `(mod_x, mod_y)` was already in `freq`; otherwise, the tuple is present with a frequency of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `beautiful_count` is incremented by 1, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple \((required_mod_x, required_mod_y)\) is now present in `freq` with a frequency of 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
