Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `i`, and `i`, `s` is the input string from `input()`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Initially, `pans` contains `[n-1, i]`. After appending `i`, `pans` becomes `[n-1, i, i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
