Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `b`, `n`, and `m`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `2` to `min(n, m) + 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is `ans + (n + 2) // (2 * 2)`
   - `b` is `2`
   - `n` is an integer
   - `m` is an integer
   - `min(n, m)` must be at least `5`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `b` starts at `2` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `b` would be `2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `b` must be less than or equal to `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - Given that `min(n, m)` must be at least `5`, the smallest possible value for `min(n, m)` is `5`.
   - Therefore, `b` must be `3` for the loop to execute again because `b` starts from `2` and increments by `1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `b` needs to be `3`.
   - `n` and `m` must still satisfy `min(n, m) >= 5`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is `ans + (n + 2) // (2 * 2)`, `b` is 3, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, and min(`n`, `m`) must be at least 5**
