Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly handles the removal of substrings. It only checks for the presence of 'pie' and counts it without removing it properly.
   - It also incorrectly handles the removal of 'map'. The provided logic for removing 'map' is flawed because it only removes the first occurrence of 'map' and does not continue to check the modified string for further occurrences.

2. **Incorrect Handling of 'pie'**:
   - The function should count and remove all occurrences of 'pie', but it only returns 1 if 'pie' is found at least once, which is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Handling of 'map'**:
   - The function should remove all occurrences of 'map' and count them, but it only removes the first occurrence and continues with the rest of the string without checking for subsequent occurrences of 'map'.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
