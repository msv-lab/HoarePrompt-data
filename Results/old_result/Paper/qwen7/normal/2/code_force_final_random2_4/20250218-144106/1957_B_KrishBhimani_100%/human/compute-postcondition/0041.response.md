Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the new integer input provided by the user**.

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` takes an input string from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace by default, and assigns this list to `l1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation.
