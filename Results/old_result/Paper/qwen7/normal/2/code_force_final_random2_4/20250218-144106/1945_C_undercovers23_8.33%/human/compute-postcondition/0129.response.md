Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 5, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 25, `one` is 1, and `lst` contains the values 3, 4, and 5.**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 4, `i + 1` equals 5. Therefore, the list `lst` now contains the values 3, 4, and 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
