The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( t \) (number of test cases) and an integer \( n \) (size of the permutation). For each test case, it queries a sequence \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) which is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\) using comparison queries. After processing, it outputs two indices: \( mak2 \) and \( pans[mak] \), which represent the result of the comparisons.
