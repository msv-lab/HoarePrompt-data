Postcondition: `i` is 'B', `p` must be 'ABCDEF', `ans` is updated to either `0 + 5*m` or `0 + 6*m - (m - hmp['F'])` plus `(m - hmp[i])` if `hmp[i] < m`. `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in the string `s` and includes the key 'F', and the character 'i' must be in the counter `hmp`.
