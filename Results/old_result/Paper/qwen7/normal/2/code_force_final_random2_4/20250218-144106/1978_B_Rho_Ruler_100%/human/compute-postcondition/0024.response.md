Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `mid` which is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `high` is greater than or equal to `mid`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `profit_mid` by calling the function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. The values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged from their initial states.
