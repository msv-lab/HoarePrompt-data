Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is now `[suffZero[-1] + 3]`, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 3, `n` is unchanged, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**

Explanation: The line `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]` updates the value of `oneInd` to be twice the last element of `preOne`. Since `preOne` is unchanged, `oneInd` is updated to `2 * preOne[-1]`. All other variables remain in their original state as they are not affected by this line of code.
