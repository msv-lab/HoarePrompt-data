Output State: **`beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is now present in `freq` plus one occurrence.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the tuple (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) in the dictionary `freq`. The values of `beautiful_count`, `mod_y`, `a`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged. The only change is that the frequency of the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` increases by one.
