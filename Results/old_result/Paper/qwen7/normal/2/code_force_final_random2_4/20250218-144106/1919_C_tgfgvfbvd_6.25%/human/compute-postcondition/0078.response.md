Output State: **`c` is 1 more than its original value, `n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is `n`.**

The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Since the initial state of `n`, `y`, and `x` remains unchanged according to the given conditions, these variables retain their original relationships and values. Therefore, `c` is the only variable that has been updated.
