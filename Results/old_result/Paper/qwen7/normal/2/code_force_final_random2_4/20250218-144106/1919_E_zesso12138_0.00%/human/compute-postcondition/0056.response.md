Postcondition: `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length `2 * n + 1`, and for each `j` where `j` is less than or equal to `2 * n`:
- If `dp[j] > 0`, then `new_dp[j]` is updated to `(new_dp[j] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD`, and if `j - 1` is within bounds and `dp[j] > 0`, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
