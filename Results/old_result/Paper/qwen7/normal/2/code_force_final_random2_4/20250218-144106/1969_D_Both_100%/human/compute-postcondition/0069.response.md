Output State: **`item` is the removed_item, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is adjusted by either subtracting `item[1]` or adding `item[0]`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit` becomes greater than `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.**

Explanation: The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs two operations:
1. It pops the smallest element from the heap (`heap`).
2. It pushes the new element (`item`) onto the heap.

After this operation:
- `item` is set to the `removed_item`.
- `combined` is modified by having one element less.
- `heap` is modified by pushing `item` and popping the smallest element.
- `current_profit` is adjusted by either subtracting `item[1]` or adding `item[0]`.
- `max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit` becomes greater than `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.

All other conditions and preconditions remain valid, including the requirement that `combined` must still contain at least one element.
