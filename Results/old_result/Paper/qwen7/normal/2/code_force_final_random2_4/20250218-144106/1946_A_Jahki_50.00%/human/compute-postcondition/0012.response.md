Output State: **`op` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, and `num2` is less than or equal to 10000.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` containing integers extracted from the string `case` using `split()` and filtering with `isdigit()`. The original values of `op`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, and `case` remain unchanged. The new list `a` contains only the integer values from `case` that are digits.
