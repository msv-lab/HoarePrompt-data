Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is 'F', `p` remains 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is 'mmm' because for each iteration of the loop, when `i` (which cycles through 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F') is not in `hmp`, `ans` increments by `m`. Since `hmp` does not contain any of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F', `ans` will increment by `m` six times, resulting in `ans` being equal to 'mmm'.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` cycles through 'F', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A', `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]` for each iteration where `hmp[i] < m`, and `hmp` remains an empty set or a set that does not contain any of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 'B', `hmp` remains an empty set or a set that does not contain any of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F', and `ans` is increased by `m - hmp['B']` if `hmp['B'] < m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `hmp[i]` is compared with `m`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. If `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`, no change is made to `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
