Output State: **`casos` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), and `c` is `c + 1`; `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `casos`, `t`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, `casos` must still be greater than 0, `t` must still be an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), and `c` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. The variable `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user.
