Output State: **`total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, the first element of `a` is -1000000000.0, the second element of `a` is any value, the third element of `a` is any value, the fourth element of `a` is any value, `b` is [0, 2 * v ** (v > x - w)], `v` is `y - x`.**

Explanation: 
- The initial state of `b` is `[0, 0]`.
- The code updates `b` using the formula `b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.
- Since `b` initially is `[0, 0]`, the first element of `b` (`b[-2]`) is `0` and the second element of `b` (`b[-1]`) is `0`.
- The updated first element of `b` is `0 + 0 + v ** (v > x - w)`, which simplifies to `v ** (v > x - w)`.
- The updated second element of `b` is `0 + 0 + v ** (v > z - y)`, which simplifies to `v ** (v > z - y)`.
- Therefore, `b` becomes `[v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)]`. Given the expression, the second element of `b` is `2 * v ** (v > x - w)` because the original second element was `0` and the addition operation only affects the first element.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
