Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `r[2] + 1` or `r[2] + a`.
- `y1` is either `r[3] + 1` or `r[3] - 1`.
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
- `y2` is either `1` or `m`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- `(x2 - x1)` is odd.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `t` is `abs(r[5] - r[3])`.
- `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`.
- `x1` is greater than or equal to `1`.
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `c` is either `y1 - 1` or `m - y1` depending on the path taken through the if-else block.
- The condition `b // 2 > a` and `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c` and `(1 <= y1 <= m)` and `(1 <= x1 <= n)` is true.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

Given the above conditions, the print statement will output the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
