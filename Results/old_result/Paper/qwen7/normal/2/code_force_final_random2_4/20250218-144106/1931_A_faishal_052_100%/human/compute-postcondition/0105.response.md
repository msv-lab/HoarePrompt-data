Output State: **`arr` is no longer sorted in ascending order; `info` contains a list which is a copy of the original `arr`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`**

Explanation: The code `arr = []` assigns an empty list to `arr`, which means `arr` is no longer sorted in ascending order since it now contains no elements. The other variables (`info` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
