Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `j` is `m-1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the `m` iterations, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `p` is updated to `p // gcd`, `q` is updated to `q // gcd`**.

The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now specific integers based on user input, while the other variables remain unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd`) are not directly affected by this line of code, but their definitions and relationships remain intact.
