Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is greater than 1; `mak2` is equal to `n-1`; `pans` is a list containing 0; `s` is the string input by the user, `s` is not equal to `<`, and the current value of `s` is equal to '='**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `pans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
