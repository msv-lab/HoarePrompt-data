Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is an integer from user input; `b` is an integer from user input; `adj[b]` contains `a` appended to it; `i` is `n - 1`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the precondition that `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from user input, `b` is an integer from user input, and `i` is `n - 1` still holds true. The only change is that `adj[b]` now contains `a` appended to its existing elements.
