Output State: **`low` is such that `low + 2 <= high` or `low` is such that `low <= high - 2`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the return value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)'; `profit_next` is the return value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)'; `max_profit` is the maximum value between `max_profit` and `profit_mid`; `high` is `mid - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. All other variables (`low`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
