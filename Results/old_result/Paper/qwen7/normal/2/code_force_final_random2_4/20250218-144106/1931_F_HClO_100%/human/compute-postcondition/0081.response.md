Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` was `i + 1` before this line, `idx1` and `idx2` are now both set to `i`. The conditions and values of `n`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged from their previous states.
