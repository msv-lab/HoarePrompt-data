Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    if len(s) == 1:
        print('No')
    elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
        print('No')
    else:
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s == s2:
            s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism. If the length of `s` is equal to 1, the function does nothing to `s`. Otherwise, if the length of `s` is greater than 1 and the set of characters in `s` contains exactly one unique character, then the function does nothing to `s`. Otherwise, `s2` is either the string obtained by moving the first character of `s` to the end of `s`, or `s2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism. If the length of the set of characters in `s` is 1, then `s` consists of the same character repeated multiple times. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, then either `s` remains unchanged, or `s2` is a string obtained by moving the first character of `s` to the end of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism, and `s` is assigned the value of the input string. If the string `s` has a length of 1, then `s2` remains `s`. Otherwise, if `s` consists of all the same characters and has a length greater than 1, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated by one character to the left. Otherwise, `s2` remains a random permutation of the string `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
