Output State: **`cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`. Each tuple represents a pair of an input integer and the next line of input from stdin with leading and trailing whitespace removed, for a total of `t` such pairs.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cases` will contain exactly `t` elements, each being a tuple `(n, s)` where `n` is an integer read from standard input and `s` is the subsequent line of input from standard input, both stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
