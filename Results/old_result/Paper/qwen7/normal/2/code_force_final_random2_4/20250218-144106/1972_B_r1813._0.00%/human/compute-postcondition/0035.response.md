Output State: **`index` is 9, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is data[7], `s` is data[8], `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
