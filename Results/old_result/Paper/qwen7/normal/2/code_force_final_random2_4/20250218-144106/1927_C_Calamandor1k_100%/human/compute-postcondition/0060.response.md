Output State: **`total_distinct` is equal to the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` is a list with 'NO' appended, and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `total_distinct` and `results` remain unchanged from their initial state.
