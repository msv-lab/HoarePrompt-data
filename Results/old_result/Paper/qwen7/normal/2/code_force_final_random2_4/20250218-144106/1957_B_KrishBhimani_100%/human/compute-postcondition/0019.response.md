Output State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the given code, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial states.
