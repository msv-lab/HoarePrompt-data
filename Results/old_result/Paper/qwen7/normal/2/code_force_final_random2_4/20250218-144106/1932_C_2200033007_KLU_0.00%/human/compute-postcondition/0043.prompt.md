You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `b` is a list containing all elements from `a` in the order specified by `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is an empty list, `p` is the product of all elements in the original list `b`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, starting from the last element.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `b` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The variable `p` will hold the product of all elements in the original list `b`. The list `ans` will contain the cumulative product of all elements in `b`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first, with each iteration's product being appended to `ans`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list `ans` containing the cumulative product of all elements in the original list `b`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a reversed list `ans` containing the cumulative product of all elements in the original list `b`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a reversed list `ans` containing the cumulative product of all elements in the original list `b`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
