Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `s.find('pie') != -1`. This means the loop will continue as long as the substring 'pie' is found within `s`.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s`.
   - `s` is the final string left after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed.

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `s`, so we can only adjust this one.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `s` must contain the substring 'pie'. If `s` does not contain 'pie', the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `s` must contain 'pie' for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `s` has 'pie' in it.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `s` must contain the substring 'pie'.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s`, and `s` must contain the substring 'pie'**.
