### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case using `list(map(int, input().split()))`.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**: The program checks if Bob's initial position (`x2`) is less than or equal to Alice's initial position (`x1`). If true, it immediately prints 'Draw'. This is correct according to the rules.

3. **Odd Difference Check**: If the difference between Bob's and Alice's initial row positions is odd, the program checks if the initial column positions are the same. If true, it prints 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can always force a win by moving diagonally towards Bob's column.

4. **Even Difference Check**: If the difference is even, the program performs more detailed checks to determine the winner. These checks involve moving Alice and Bob's positions and calculating distances to determine if Alice can force a win. However, there are several issues with these checks:
   - The logic for updating positions and checking distances is complex and not fully aligned with the game rules.
   - The conditions for determining a win or draw are not clearly defined and may lead to incorrect outcomes.
   - The program does not handle all edge cases properly, such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board without capturing the opponent's chip.

Let's break down the detailed checks for even differences:

- **Update Positions**: The program updates Alice's and Bob's positions based on certain conditions. However, the logic for updating positions and the conditions for winning are not clear and may lead to incorrect outcomes.
- **Distance Calculations**: The program calculates distances and checks if Alice can force a win. The conditions for these checks are not clearly defined and may not cover all possible scenarios.

Given the complexity and the potential for errors in the detailed checks, let's re-evaluate the program:

- **Detailed Checks**: The detailed checks for even differences are overly complicated and may not accurately reflect the game's rules. The program should focus on simpler and more straightforward logic to determine the winner.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases properly, such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board without capturing the opponent's chip.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the detailed checks and the lack of proper handling of edge cases. The program needs to be revised to ensure it correctly implements the game rules and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the overly complex and potentially incorrect detailed checks, and the lack of proper handling of edge cases.
