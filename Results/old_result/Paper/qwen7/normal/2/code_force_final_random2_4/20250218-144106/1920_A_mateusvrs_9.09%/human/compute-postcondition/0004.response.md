Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `_` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set.**

The code creates an empty set named `cx`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `r`, `_`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
