Output State: **`max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple (except the last one which was possibly popped), `k` is greater than 1, and `heap` is a heap containing the last element of the `combined` list after popping the last element.**

Explanation: The code pushes the last element of the `combined` list onto the `heap` using `heapq.heappush()`. Since `combined` was already a sorted list based on the second element of each tuple (except the last one which was possibly popped), the last element is now popped and pushed onto the `heap`. The other variables (`max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
