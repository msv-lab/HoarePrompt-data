Postcondition: `y` is either `n - 1 - ii` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, or `0` if the condition is not met. `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is adjusted according to the condition: if the condition is true, `k` becomes `0`; otherwise, `k` is reduced by `(ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii])`. `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is updated to the second element of list `a` if the condition is not met, otherwise it remains as `a[ii] + k // (ii + 1)`. `rem` is `0`.
