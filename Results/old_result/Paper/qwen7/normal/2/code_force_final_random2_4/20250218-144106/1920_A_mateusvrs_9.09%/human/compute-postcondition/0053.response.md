Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `cx`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cx` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` is the next element in `cx`.
   - `tmp` is increased by 1.

4. **Loop Body Analysis**:
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` remains increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `tmp` remains increased by 1 as there is no else part changing its value.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `cx`, after processing `i`, the next element in `cx` becomes `i`.
   - `tmp` will remain increased by 1 regardless of the condition because there is no else part changing its value.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `cx` will now contain the remaining elements of the list after the current element `i` has been processed.
   - `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
   - `tmp` will still be increased by 1.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cx` must contain at least one element (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1**.
