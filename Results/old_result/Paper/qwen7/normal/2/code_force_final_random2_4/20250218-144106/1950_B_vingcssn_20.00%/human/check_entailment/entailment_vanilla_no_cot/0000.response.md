Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution only handles specific cases (n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4) and does not generalize for any \( n \) within the given range. For \( n > 4 \), the function will print "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in range" in English), which is incorrect according to the problem statement. Additionally, the pattern for creating the checkerboard for any \( n \) is not implemented. 

To correctly solve this problem, you should use a loop to generate the pattern for any \( n \). Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(2 * n):
            for j in range(2 * n):
                if (i // 2 + j // 2) % 2 == 0:
                    print('#', end='')
                else:
                    print('.', end='')
            print()
```

This solution uses a nested loop to print the checkerboard pattern for any \( n \) within the specified range.
