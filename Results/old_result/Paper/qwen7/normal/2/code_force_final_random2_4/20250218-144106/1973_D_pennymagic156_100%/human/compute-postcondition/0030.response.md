Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `l = func_2() + 1` assigns the value of `func_2()` plus 1 to the variable `l`. Since `func_2()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `l` is now `func_2() + 1`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `cnt`, and `l`) are updated accordingly.
