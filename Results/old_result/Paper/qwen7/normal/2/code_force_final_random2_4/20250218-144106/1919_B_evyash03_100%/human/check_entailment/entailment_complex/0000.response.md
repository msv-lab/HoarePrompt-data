Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty**: The function `func_1` simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`. This approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Optimal Splitting Strategy**: The problem requires finding the optimal way to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The current implementation does not consider different possible splits and their respective penalties.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `"-----"` (length 5), the function returns `5`, which is incorrect. The optimal split would be `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])`, resulting in a penalty of `5`.
   - For the input `"+-+-+"` (length 5), the function returns `4`, which is incorrect. The optimal split could be `([1, -1, 1, -1, 1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`.

The correct approach should involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal splits. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Correctness: **False**
