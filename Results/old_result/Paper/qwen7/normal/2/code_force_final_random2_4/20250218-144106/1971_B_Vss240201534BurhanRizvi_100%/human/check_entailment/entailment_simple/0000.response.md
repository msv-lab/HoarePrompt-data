Reasoning:

1. The program correctly handles the case where the length of the string `s` is 1, printing "No" as there is no way to rearrange a single character into a different string.
2. It also correctly identifies when the string consists of all the same characters and has a length greater than 1, in which case it rotates the string by one character to the left to ensure it is different from the original string.
3. For other cases, the program generates a random permutation of the string `s` using `random.sample`. This ensures that the generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s`.
4. The program prints "Yes" followed by the generated string `s2` for valid cases and "No" for invalid cases, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
