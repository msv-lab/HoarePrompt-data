### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to process each command in the string `s` one by one.
- For each command:
  - Compute the remainder of the product of all elements in the array `a` when divided by `m`.
  - If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from `a`.
  - If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from `a`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes an empty list `b` and two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - Iterates over the string `s` and appends the leftmost or rightmost element of `a` to `b` based on the command.
   - After processing all commands, `b` contains all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`.

2. **Computation of Product**:
   - Reverses the list `b` and computes the cumulative product of its elements.
   - Appends each intermediate product to the list `ans`.
   - Returns the reversed list `ans`.

#### Key Points:
- The program correctly processes the commands and constructs the list `b` in the required order.
- However, it does not compute the product of the remaining elements after each removal step. Instead, it computes the product of the elements in the reversed order of their original positions.

#### Correctness Check:
- The original assessment states that the program does not compute the product of the remaining elements after each removal step. This is indeed true based on the current implementation.
- The program computes the product of the elements in the order they were removed, not the remaining elements.

#### Example Breakdown:
- Consider the first test case: `4 6`, `[3, 1, 4, 2]`, `LRRL`
  - Expected output: `0 2 4 1`
  - Actual output: The program will compute the product of the elements in the order they were removed, which is incorrect.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the problem description because it does not compute the product of the remaining elements after each removal step.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
