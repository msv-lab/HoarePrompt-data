Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in pl`. This means the loop iterates over the elements in the list `pl`.

2. **Current States**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `shapes` is 2
   - `j` is 2
   - `d[j]` (which is `d[2]`) is greater than or equal to 3

3. **Loop Condition**: For the loop to continue executing, the condition `j in pl` must hold true. Since `j` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `2` is in the list `pl`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `shapes` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 3.
   - We need to check if `3` is in the list `pl`. If `3` is in `pl`, then the loop will continue.

5. **Post-Iteration States**:
   - If `3` is in `pl`, then `j` will be 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `3` must be in `pl`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`shapes` is 2, `j` is 3, and `3` must be in the list `pl`**
