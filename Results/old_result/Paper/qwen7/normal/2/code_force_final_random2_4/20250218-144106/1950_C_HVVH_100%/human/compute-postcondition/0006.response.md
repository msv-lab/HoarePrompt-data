Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is an input integer**.

The code simply reassigns the value of `day` to 'AM', which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `h`, or `m`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
