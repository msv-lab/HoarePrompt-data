Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `sums` is either `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[1 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[1]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`, and `ans` contains `[sums]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `[sums + a[1] - 2 * a[1 + x - 1], sums]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. It ensures that `i` is set to 2, `k` remains greater than or equal to 0, and `sums` is updated according to the specified conditions. The value of `ans` is also correctly updated based on the value of `sums` and `x`.
