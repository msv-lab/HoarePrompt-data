Postcondition: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is 0, and if the character at position `right` is '0' and the character at position `left` is '1', then these positions and their values are updated accordingly.
