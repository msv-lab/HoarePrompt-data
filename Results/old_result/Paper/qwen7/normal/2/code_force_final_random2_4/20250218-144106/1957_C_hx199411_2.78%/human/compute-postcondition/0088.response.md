Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is the total number of inputs processed, `m` is greater than 0, and `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, and `dp[1] = 1`.**

The code `dp[1] = 1` sets the first element of the list `dp` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
