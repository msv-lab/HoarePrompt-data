Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `t`. Since `t` was initially set to 1, its value remains unchanged. The values of `u` and `v` are not yet determined as they are not assigned in the given code snippet, but they are constrained to be between 1 and `n`. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input.
