### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.
   - The provided code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling the function `func_1(s)`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - The function `func_1(s)`:
     - Converts the string `sChar` into a list of characters.
     - Initializes `left` and `right` pointers and a `cost` variable.
     - Iterates through the string to find positions where a swap can reduce the cost.
     - Swaps characters when a '0' is found to the left of a '1' and updates the cost.
     - Moves the `left` and `right` pointers appropriately to find the next possible swaps.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1(s)` does not correctly identify positions where a swap can reduce the cost. Specifically, the current implementation only checks for a '0' to the left of a '1' and swaps them without considering the cyclic nature of the shifts.
   - The function does not handle the cyclic shift properly. It simply swaps characters in the list without performing a true cyclic shift, which means it does not account for the actual cost of the operation.
   - The function does not ensure that the string is fully sorted. It only performs swaps based on the first occurrence of a '0' to the left of a '1', which may not be the optimal solution.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted, the function returns 0, which is correct.
   - However, for strings that require multiple cyclic shifts to be sorted, the current logic will not produce the correct result. For example, consider the string "101011". The correct minimum cost would be 9, but the current implementation will not achieve this.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string due to the incorrect handling of cyclic shifts.
   - The function does not account for the true cost of cyclic shifts and may not find the optimal solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the cyclic nature of the shifts and does not guarantee the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
