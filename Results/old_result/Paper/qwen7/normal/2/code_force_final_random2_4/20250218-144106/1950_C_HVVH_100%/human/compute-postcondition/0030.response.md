Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer, `h` is decreased by 12.**

Explanation: The code simply changes the value of `day` to 'PM'. The values of `t`, `n`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `h` is an integer between 1 and 12 is maintained, but its value is decreased by 12.
