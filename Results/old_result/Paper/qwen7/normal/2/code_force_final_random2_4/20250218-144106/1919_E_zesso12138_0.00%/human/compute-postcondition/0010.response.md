Output State: **`index` is 4 + n, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is an empty list, `p` is now a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**.

The value of `index` is updated by adding `n` to its current value, which is 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
