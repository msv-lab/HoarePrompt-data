Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided solution, we need to verify if the code correctly generates an array \(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}\) that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Bit Representation**: For each test case, the code converts the integer \(x\) into its binary representation using bitwise operations. This part is correct and ensures that the array elements are either '0' or '1'.
3. **Transformation Logic**:
   - The code iterates through the bits of \(x\) and appends '1' or '0' to the list `s` based on whether the bit is set.
   - It then checks for consecutive '1's and replaces them according to the rules specified in the problem statement. Specifically, it changes a pair of consecutive '1's to '-1' and '0' respectively, and sets the flag accordingly.
   - If the last bit is '0' and the flag is set, it adjusts the list to ensure the final condition is met.
   - Finally, it reverses the sign of some elements to satisfy the non-consecutive '1's rule.
4. **Output Generation**: The code correctly prints the length of the array and the array itself.

Given the detailed steps and the provided example outputs, the transformation logic appears to handle the constraints and requirements of the problem effectively. The code ensures that no two consecutive '1's exist and that the sum matches the input \(x\).

Correctness: **True**
