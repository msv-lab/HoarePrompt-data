The loop condition in the given `while` statement is `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` is described as a non-empty value decreased by the total number of iterations of the loop, it means `t` starts as a non-empty value and decreases by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than 0.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:

- The variable `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

No other states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head conditions.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
