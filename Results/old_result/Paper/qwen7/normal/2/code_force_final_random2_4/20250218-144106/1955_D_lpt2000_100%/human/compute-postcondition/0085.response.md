Postcondition: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` > 0, `m` is incremented by 1, `fnd` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `in_aa` remains unchanged, `out_aa` remains unchanged, `aa` remains unchanged, `bb` remains unchanged, `cnt_aa` remains unchanged, `cnt_bb` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` remains unchanged. If `E[out_aa]` <= 0, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than or equal to -3, `E[out_aa]` remains unchanged and is less than or equal to 0.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block. It describes the changes in the variables based on the conditions and actions taken in each part of the if-else statement.
