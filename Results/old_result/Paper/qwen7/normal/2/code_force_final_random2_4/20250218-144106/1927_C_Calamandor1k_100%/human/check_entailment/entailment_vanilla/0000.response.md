Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine if it's possible to select exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from both arrays `a` and `b` such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes a list `cases` to store the details of each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the necessary information (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) and stores them in the `cases` list.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to process these cases and determine the result for each one.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function iterates through each test case.
   - It creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to \( k \).
   - It calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
   - It checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \). If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
   - It checks if the total number of distinct elements (`total_distinct`) is less than \( k \). If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it appends 'YES' to the results list.

4. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The code correctly handles the constraints and checks for the conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - The logic for determining the possibility of choosing the required elements is sound and covers all edge cases mentioned in the problem.

Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose the required elements from both arrays. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
