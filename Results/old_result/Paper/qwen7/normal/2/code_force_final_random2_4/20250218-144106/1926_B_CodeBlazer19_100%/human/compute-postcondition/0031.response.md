Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or remains 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `s` is the updated input string. If the count of '1' in the string `s` is exactly 1, then `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, and `s` is updated accordingly.**
