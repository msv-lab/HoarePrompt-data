Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `b` is `l[x]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `b = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[x]` to `b`. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `y` is still `n - 1` and `x` is still `n`. The value of `b` is updated to be `l[x]`.
