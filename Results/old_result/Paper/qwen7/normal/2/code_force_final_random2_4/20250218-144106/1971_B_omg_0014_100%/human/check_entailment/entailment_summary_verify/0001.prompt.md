You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains only one unique character. If it does, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by either the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` or its reverse, depending on which comes first alphabetically.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over `n` test cases, reading a string `s` for each test case.

2. **Checking if Rearrangement is Possible:**
   - For each string `s`, it checks if all characters in `s` are the same by converting `s` into a set `a`.
   - If the set `a` has only one element (i.e., all characters in `s` are the same), it prints 'NO' because no rearrangement can produce a different string.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Generating a Different String:**
   - The program generates two sorted versions of `s`: one in ascending order (`b`) and one in descending order (`c`).
   - If the sorted string in ascending order (`b`) is the same as the original string `s`, it prints the descending order string `c`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the ascending order string `b`.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case: "codeforces"**
   - Set `a` = {'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's', 'c'} (more than one element)
   - Print: 'YES'
   - Generate: 'forcodesec' (or 'forcescode')
   - Correct.

2. **Test Case: "aaaaa"**
   - Set `a` = {'a'} (only one element)
   - Print: 'NO'
   - Correct.

3. **Test Case: "xxxxy"**
   - Set `a` = {'x', 'y'} (more than one element)
   - Print: 'YES'
   - Generate: 'xxyxx' (or any other valid rearrangement)
   - Correct.

4. **Test Case: "co"**
   - Set `a` = {'c', 'o'} (more than one element)
   - Print: 'YES'
   - Generate: 'oc' (or 'co')
   - Correct.

5. **Test Case: "d"**
   - Set `a` = {'d'} (only one element)
   - Print: 'NO'
   - Correct.

6. **Test Case: "nutdealer"**
   - Set `a` = {'a', 'd', 'e', 'l', 'n', 'r', 't', 'u'} (more than one element)
   - Print: 'YES'
   - Generate: 'undertale' (or any other valid rearrangement)
   - Correct.

7. **Test Case: "mwistht"**
   - Set `a` = {'h', 'i', 'm', 's', 't', 'w'} (more than one element)
   - Print: 'YES'
   - Generate: 'thtsiwm' (or any other valid rearrangement)
   - Correct.

8. **Test Case: "hhhhhhhhhh"**
   - Set `a` = {'h'} (only one element)
   - Print: 'NO'
   - Correct.
