### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` and the string `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n`, `m`, and `a` as parameters.
   - It initializes an array `count` of size 7 to zero. This array will store the count of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').

3. **Counting Existing Problems:**
   - The program iterates over the string `a`, incrementing the corresponding index in the `count` array for each character encountered.
   - This step ensures that the `count` array accurately reflects the current distribution of problem difficulties in the input string `a`.

4. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - The program then iterates over the `count` array, checking if the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`.
   - If the count of a particular difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
   - This step correctly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to ensure that there are at least `m` problems for each round.

5. **Returning the Result:**
   - The function returns the total number of additional problems needed, which is the sum of all increments made during the loop iterations.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - Before the function call, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 5\), and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

- **After Counting:**
  - After the loop in `func_1`, the `count` array will have the correct counts for each difficulty level in the string `a`.
  - The `char` variable will be the last character of `a`, and the `a` string will be fully processed.

- **Calculating Needed Problems:**
  - The loop iterates over the `count` array, ensuring that each difficulty level has at least `m` problems.
  - The `needed_problems` variable correctly accumulates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level.

- **Final Return:**
  - The function returns the total number of additional problems needed, which matches the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
