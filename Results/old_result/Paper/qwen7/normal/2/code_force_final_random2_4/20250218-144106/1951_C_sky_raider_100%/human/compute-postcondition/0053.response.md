Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the input value, `m` is the second input value, `k` is the third input value, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
