Output State: **`a` is a list of three integers sorted in descending order: [x, k, n], `sum1` is x + k + n**.

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `sum1`. Since `a` is initially `[x, k, n]` and is sorted in descending order, `sum1` will be the sum of `x`, `k`, and `n`. The list `a` itself does not change, only `sum1` is added as a new variable holding the sum of the elements in `a`.
