Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is decreased by (2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2]); `r` is a[3]**.

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `k` is decreased by the expression `(2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])`. The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`, which is `a[3]` since `i` is 2.
