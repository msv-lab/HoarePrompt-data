Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. The loop variable here is an underscore `_`, but the key variables involved in determining whether the loop can execute again are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `cases` is a list containing two tuples, each of the form `(n, s)`. However, these details about `cases` are not directly relevant to the loop condition.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since we are not given the exact value of `t`, we need to consider the general condition for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. If `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it means `t` was decremented by 1 during the current iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is now 1 (since it was decremented by 1 in the current iteration).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first tuple is (n, s), the second tuple is also (n, s), t must be greater than 1**
