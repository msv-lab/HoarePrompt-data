Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The initial conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 1 and `i` is still 0. The values of `u` and `v` are the integers input by the user.
