Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no', 'no', and 'no', `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contains two `'no'` strings and the string input by the user. After appending another `'no'`, `results` now contains three `'no'` strings. All other variables remain unchanged.
