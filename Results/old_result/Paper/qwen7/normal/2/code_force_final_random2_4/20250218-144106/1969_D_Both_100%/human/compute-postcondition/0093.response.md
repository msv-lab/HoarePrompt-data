Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(k)`. The variables involved here are `k`.

2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `current_profit` remains 0
   - `max_profit` remains 0
   - `heap` contains the first tuple from `combined`
   - `remaining_items` is an empty list
   - `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`
   - `n` is the return value of `func_2()`
   - `k` must be greater than 0
   - `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be decremented by 1 and still remain greater than 0.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`.

**Final State**:
State: **`current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` remains 0, `heap` contains the first tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` must be greater than 1, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**
