Output State: **`no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2 (excluding `i_current`), and `num` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. The precondition states that `num` is decremented by 1, and the value of `no` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `no` still contains at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2 (excluding `i_current`).
