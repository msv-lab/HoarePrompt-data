Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` is now `r - 1` or remains n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is equal to `sunks + 1` or `sunks + 2` or `sunks + 3` or remains 0, 1, or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, the value of `a[r]` is less than the value of `a[l]` if the condition `a[r] < a[l]` is true, otherwise `r` remains unchanged and `sunks` changes accordingly.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` is either decreased by 1 or remains unchanged, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then `r` is decreased by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`; otherwise, `r` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is incremented by either 1 or 2 depending on the condition, `r` is either unchanged or decremented by 1, `sunks` is increased by at least 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `l` is incremented by 1 or 2, `r` is decremented by 1, `sunks` is increased by 2, and `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`. Otherwise, `l` is incremented by 1 or 2, `r` is unchanged or decremented by 1, and `sunks` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
