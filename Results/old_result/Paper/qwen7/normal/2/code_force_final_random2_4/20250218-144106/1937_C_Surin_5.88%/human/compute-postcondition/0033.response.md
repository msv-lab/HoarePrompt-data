Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `prev` is 0.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `v1` retains its last value which is 3 if `r` was '<' during any iteration.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because `range(1, n)` will generate values from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` and the loop starts with `i` being 1, `i` must be adjusted to 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `prev`, `v2`, and `v1` are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly affect whether the loop can execute. They can remain as they are.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
