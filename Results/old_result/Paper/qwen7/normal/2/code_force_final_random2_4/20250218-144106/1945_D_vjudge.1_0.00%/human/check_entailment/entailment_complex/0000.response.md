Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly reverses the input lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
   - It calculates `soma_b` as the cumulative sum of elements in `lista_B` from the start to the current index.
   - It calculates `pref` as the prefix sum based on certain conditions involving `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
   - The logic for updating `pref` and `soma_b` is correct, ensuring that `pref` captures the minimal cost to move Kirill to a position where he is among the first `m` people.
   - The final result is computed correctly by iterating through the relevant portion of the lists and finding the minimum cost.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each one by calling `func_1()`.
   - The logic for reading and processing each test case is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the detailed analysis above, both functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. They handle the input, process the data according to the problem constraints, and produce the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
