Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is now `[suffZero[-1] + 3]`, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is unchanged, `oneInd` is unchanged, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 3, `n` is unchanged, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**

Explanation: 
- The line `ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1` assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`.
- The value of `suffZero` is updated to `[suffZero[-1] + 2 + 1]`, which simplifies to `[suffZero[-1] + 3]` since `2 + 1` equals `3`.
- All other variables (`el`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `ans`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
