Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the input split by spaces, `check_all` is True if all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-2` are less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `check_all` is False, and `check_all` is now set to the result of the condition check.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` which is `a[1]` and onwards, `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]), and either both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are True, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or at least one of `check_all_new` or `new_all` is False, in which case we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `new` starts from `a[2]` and onwards, `check_all_new` is determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, `new_all` remains True because the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])` is met, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Whether or not the elements in the slice `new` (from index 3 to the end of the original sequence) satisfy the conditions `check_all_new` (all elements are greater than or equal to their corresponding index) and `new_all` (all elements satisfy `(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new)))`, the program will exit the current loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
