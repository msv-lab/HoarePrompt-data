Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is increased by `s * (l[0] + t)`**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Since `i` is 0, `l[i]` is `l[0]`. The value of `s` remains the minimum value between `m` and `k`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
