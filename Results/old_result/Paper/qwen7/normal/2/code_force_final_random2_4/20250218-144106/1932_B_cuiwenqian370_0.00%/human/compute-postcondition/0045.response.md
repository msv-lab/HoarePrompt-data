Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', otherwise plus 0.**

This means that the value of `dp[i]` is now calculated based on the maximum of the previous two values in the `dp` array (`dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`), and an additional 1 is added if the character at position `i` in the `path` string is '@', otherwise 0 is added. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
