Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` equals 0, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]`, and the current value of `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`.**

The code appends the value of `c[i]` (which is `c[1]` since `i` is 1) to the list `ans2`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and the relationship between `c[i]` and `c[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
