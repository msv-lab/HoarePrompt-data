Postcondition: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1, `a` remains unchanged if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, and if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` and `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, and if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` and `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`. If `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`, then `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `a >= l[x]`, then `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, and if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` and `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`. If `a < l[x]`, then `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`.**
