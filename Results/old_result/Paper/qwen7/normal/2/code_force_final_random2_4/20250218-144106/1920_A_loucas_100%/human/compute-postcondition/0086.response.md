Output State: **`less` is a list, `num` is an integer, `big` is a list, `no` is a list containing `a`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `no` now contains the value `a`, while `less`, `num`, `big`, `x`, and `a` retain their previous values.
