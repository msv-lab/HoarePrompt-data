Output State: **`heap` now contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `item` is the last item popped from `combined`, and `remaining_items` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs two operations:
1. It pops an element from the heap `heap`.
2. It pushes the `item` onto the heap.

Since `item` is the last item popped from `combined`, it is stored in the variable `removed_item`. The heap now contains the remaining elements from `combined` minus the last item popped. The variable `item` is updated to the last item popped from `combined`, and `remaining_items` remains an empty list as it was not affected by the operation.
