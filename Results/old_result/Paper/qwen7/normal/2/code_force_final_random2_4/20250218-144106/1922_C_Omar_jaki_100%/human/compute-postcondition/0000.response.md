Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a lambda function that takes input splits it and returns a tuple of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that takes input, splits it into multiple values, and converts them to integers. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, or the queries. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
