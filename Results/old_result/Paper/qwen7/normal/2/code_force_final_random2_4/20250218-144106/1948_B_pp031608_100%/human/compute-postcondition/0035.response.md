Postcondition: `ans` remains False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, and `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` and the current value of `arr[i]` converted to integers, and if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first digit of `nums`.
