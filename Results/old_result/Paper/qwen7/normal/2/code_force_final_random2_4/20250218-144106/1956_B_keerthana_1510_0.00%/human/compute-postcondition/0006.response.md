Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `line in [*open(0)][2::2]`. This means the loop variable `line` is assigned values from the sequence generated by `[*open(0)][2::2]`.

2. **Understand the sequence generation**:
   - `[*open(0)]`: This reads all lines from standard input and converts the file object to a list of lines.
   - `[2::2]`: This slices the list starting from the third element (index 2) and takes every second element.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `line` is set to the fifth line from standard input.
   - The sequence `[*open(0)][2::2]` starts from the third line and takes every second line.

4. **Calculate the next line**:
   - Since the sequence starts from the third line and takes every second line, the next line in the sequence would be the seventh line from standard input.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `line`, so we need to adjust this variable.
   - After the previous iteration, `line` was the fifth line. For the next iteration, `line` should be the seventh line.

6. **Consider the elements list**:
   - The `elements` list is derived from the current `line` by splitting it on whitespace. Since the `line` changes, the `elements` list will also change accordingly.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`line` is set to the seventh line from standard input; `elements` is the list obtained by splitting `line` on whitespace**.
