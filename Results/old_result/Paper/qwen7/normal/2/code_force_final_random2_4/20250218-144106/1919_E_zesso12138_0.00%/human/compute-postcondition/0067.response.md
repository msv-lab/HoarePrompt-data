Output State: **`dp` remains equal to `new_dp`, `i` remains 2, `n` remains at least 1, `new_dp[3]` is updated to `(new_dp[3] + dp[2]) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j + 1]` based on the current values of `new_dp[j + 1]` and `dp[j]`. Given that `j = 3` at this point, `new_dp[3]` is updated to `(new_dp[3] + dp[2]) % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
