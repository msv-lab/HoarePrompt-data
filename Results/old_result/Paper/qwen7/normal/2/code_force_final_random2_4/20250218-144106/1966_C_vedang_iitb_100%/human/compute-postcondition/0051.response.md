Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements processed, `mexsize` is updated to the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by the number of iterations the loop executed, which is equal to the length of the list `a`, `n` remains unchanged, and `t` remains unchanged. Additionally, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
