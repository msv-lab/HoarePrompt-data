Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters of `s`, `b` is the sorted version of `s` (as a string), `c` is the sorted version of `s` in descending order (same as `b`).** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts because neither part modifies the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the overall postcondition is simply a restatement of the initial precondition since no changes are made to the variables involved.
