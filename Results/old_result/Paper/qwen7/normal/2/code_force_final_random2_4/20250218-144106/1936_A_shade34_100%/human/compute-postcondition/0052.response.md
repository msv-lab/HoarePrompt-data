Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is greater than 1 but its exact value is not specified.
- `s` is an input string. Its value is not explicitly given.
- `pans` is a list containing either the integer 0 or the integers 0 and 1. Since `s` equals '<', `pans` will contain the integer 1.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Here, `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the initial state, so they are undefined variables. Since the problem does not provide their values, we cannot determine what these variables will print.

Given the information, the only defined values are `i = 1` and `pans` contains the integer 1, but this value is not directly printed. Therefore, the output will include the placeholder values for `mak` and `mak2`.

Output: **'? ', mak, mak2, 1, mak2**
