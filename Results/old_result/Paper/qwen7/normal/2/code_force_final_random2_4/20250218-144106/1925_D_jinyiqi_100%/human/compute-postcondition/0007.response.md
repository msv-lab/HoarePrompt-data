Output State: **`sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `j` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The value of `sum_f` is incremented by `f`. The other variables retain their initial states. The conditions and values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.
