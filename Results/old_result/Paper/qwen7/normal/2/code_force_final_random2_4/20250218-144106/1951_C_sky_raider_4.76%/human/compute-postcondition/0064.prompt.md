Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    s = 0
    c = k * k / 2
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        k -= s
        c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `s` is `min(m, k - n * s)`.

In this final state, the variable `i` will have reached the end of the range defined by `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration, where `s` is updated at the start of each iteration as the minimum of `m` and the remaining value of `k`. The variable `k` will be reduced by `n * s` over the course of the loop, and `s` will be adjusted accordingly at the beginning of each iteration based on the current value of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `c` is increased by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration where `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - (i * s)`, and `k` is reduced by `s` for each iteration. The final value of `i` will be `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`. This means that `i` will have reached the end of the range defined by `range(n)`, and the loop will have completed all its iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `c` will have been updated based on the formula `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, with `s` being the minimum of `m` and the remaining value of `k` after previous subtractions. The variable `k` will be fully depleted, and `i` will equal `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its intended iterations. The variable `n` must be at least 3 since the loop runs based on the value of `n`. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative sum of the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
