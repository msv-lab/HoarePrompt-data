Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and then converts each string to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
