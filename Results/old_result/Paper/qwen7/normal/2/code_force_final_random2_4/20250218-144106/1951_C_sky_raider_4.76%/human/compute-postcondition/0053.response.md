Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `c` is `c + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

6. **Consider the expression for `c`**: The value of `c` is not directly affected by the loop itself but by the loop body, which is omitted. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `c` unless the loop body changes its value, which is not specified here.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
