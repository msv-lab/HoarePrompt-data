### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game played on a tree where Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone from one node to an adjacent inactive node. The player who cannot make a move loses. The game is played for a single round with a fixed starting node, and the tree structure and starting node are provided as input.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a player can force a win starting from a given node. It uses a recursive approach to evaluate the tree structure. The function returns `True` if there exists a path where the player can always force a win, otherwise it returns `False`.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, identifies leaf nodes, and then calls `func_1` to determine the winner of the game. It prints "Ron" if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise it prints "Hermione".

3. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies if a player can force a win by checking if any of the children of the current node can be forced into a losing position.
   - The construction of the tree in `func_2` is correct, and the identification of leaf nodes helps in simplifying the tree structure for the recursive check.
   - The overall flow of the program matches the problem description and the provided example.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the input constraints and the logic for determining the winner.
   - The recursive function `func_1` correctly implements the game theory concept of winning and losing positions in a tree structure.
   - The output is consistent with the problem statement and the provided example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given tree structure and starting node. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
