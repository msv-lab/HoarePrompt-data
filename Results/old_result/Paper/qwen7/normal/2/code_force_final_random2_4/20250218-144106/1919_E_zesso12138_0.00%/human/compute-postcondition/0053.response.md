Postcondition: `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length `2 * n + 1`, and `new_dp[j]` is updated to `(new_dp[j] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD`, provided that `j` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `dp[j + 1] > 0`. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to 1.
