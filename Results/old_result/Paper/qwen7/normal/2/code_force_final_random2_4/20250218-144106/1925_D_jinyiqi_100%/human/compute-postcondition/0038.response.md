Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is -1, `sum_f` is the total sum of all integers `f` entered by the user, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, and all other variables (`a`, `b`, `q`, `gcd`, `k`, `i`, `m`) retain their values from the final iteration or remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`. All other variables (`cn2`, `j`, `sum_f`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `gcd`, `k`, `i`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial or final states.
