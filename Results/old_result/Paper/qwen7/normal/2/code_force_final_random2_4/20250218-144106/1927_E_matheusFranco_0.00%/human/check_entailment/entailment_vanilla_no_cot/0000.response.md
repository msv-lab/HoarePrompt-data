Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly generate a k-level permutation. The logic in `func_1` attempts to place values in the permutation array in a pattern that does not necessarily ensure the k-level condition is met. Specifically, it places values in a repeating pattern every k positions, which does not guarantee that the sums of continuous segments of length k will have a difference of no more than 1.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that the sums of any two continuous segments of length k differ by at most 1. One way to achieve this is to use a more strategic placement of numbers. Here's a corrected approach:

```python
def generate_k_level_permutation(n, k):
    # Initialize the permutation list with zeros
    permutation = [0] * n
    
    # Fill the permutation list with a pattern that ensures the k-level condition
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Place the current value in the position that maintains the k-level condition
        permutation[(i - 1) % (n - k + 1)] = i
    
    return permutation

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = generate_k_level_permutation(n, k)
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This approach ensures that the permutation is constructed in a way that the sums of any two continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1, thus satisfying the k-level condition.
