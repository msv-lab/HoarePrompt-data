Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `k` is -2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside. Since no variables are updated or reassigned within the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
