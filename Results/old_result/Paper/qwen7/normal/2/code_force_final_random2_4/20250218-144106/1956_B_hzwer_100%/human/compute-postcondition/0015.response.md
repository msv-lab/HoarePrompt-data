Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x`, which is iterating over the list `cnt`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `x`**: Since `x` is iterating over the list `cnt`, the first value of `x` will be the first element in `cnt`.

3. **Understand the purpose of the loop**: The loop is meant to process each element in the list `cnt`. After all iterations, every element in `cnt` (except for the element at index 0) will be equal to the number of times the corresponding integer appeared in the list `a`.

4. **Initial state of `cnt`**: The list `cnt` will contain the count of each integer from the list `a`. However, since the loop hasn't started yet, `cnt` is not fully populated.

5. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be at least a non-empty list, and `x` must be the first element of `cnt`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `cnt` must be a non-empty list.
- `x` must be the first element of `cnt`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**`ans` is 0, `cnt` is a non-empty list, `x` is the first element of `cnt`**.
