To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and ensure it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement. Let's break down the program and verify each part:

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Output List:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   OUT = []
   ```
   This correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes an output list.

2. **Looping Through Each Test Case:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
       s = input()
       (b, s1, s2) = func_1(s, k, n)
       if not b:
           OUT.append('No')
           i = 97
           while i <= k + 97:
               if chr(i) not in s1:
                   break
               i += 1
           be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))
           OUT.append(s2 + be9i)
       else:
           OUT.append('Yes')
   ```
   - It correctly processes each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it appends 'No' to the output list and constructs a counterexample string.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it appends 'Yes' to the output list.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(s, k, n):
       s1 = ''
       s2 = ''
       alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
       for i in s:
           if i in alphabet:
               if len(alphabet) != 1:
                   alphabet.remove(i)
               else:
                   s2 += i
                   alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
               s1 += i
       r = len(s1) // k
       return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)
   ```
   - This function checks if all characters from the alphabet can be found in `s` in the required sequence.
   - It constructs `s1` and `s2` based on the presence of characters from the alphabet in `s`.
   - It returns a boolean indicating if all characters can form the required subsequences and the constructed strings `s1` and `s2`.

### Verification

1. **Function Logic:**
   - The function correctly identifies if all characters from the alphabet can be found in `s` in the required sequence.
   - It constructs `s1` and `s2` correctly based on the presence of characters from the alphabet in `s`.

2. **Output Construction:**
   - The program correctly constructs a counterexample string if `func_1` returns `False`.
   - It appends 'Yes' or 'No' to the output list based on the result of `func_1`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to meet all the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
