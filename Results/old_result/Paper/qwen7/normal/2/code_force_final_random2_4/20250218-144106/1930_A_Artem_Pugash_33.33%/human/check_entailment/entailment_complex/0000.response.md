Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the process of reading the number of test cases (`numCases`) and then processing each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`numInteger`), which is actually `2n`.
3. It then splits the input string into a list of integers (`numbers`).
4. The list is sorted in ascending order.
5. A while loop processes the list in pairs, taking the minimum of each pair and adding it to the sum (`suma`).
6. The loop continues until the list is empty, ensuring that all pairs are processed.
7. The final sum (`suma`) is printed for each test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic in the function appears to be correct. The function correctly implements the strategy of sorting the numbers and then pairing them to maximize the score by always choosing the minimum of each pair.

Correctness: **True**
