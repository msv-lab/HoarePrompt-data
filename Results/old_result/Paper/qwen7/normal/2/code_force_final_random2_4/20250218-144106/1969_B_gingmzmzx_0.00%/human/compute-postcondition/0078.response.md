Output State: **`cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated by adding `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to its current value. The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated based on the new value of `cnt[0]` (since `cnt[0]` is part of the calculation). The value of `zeroes` remains unchanged.
