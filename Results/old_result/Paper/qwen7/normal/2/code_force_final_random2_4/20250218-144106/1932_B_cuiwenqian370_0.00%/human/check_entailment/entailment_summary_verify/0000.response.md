### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - The problem requires calculating the year in which all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially, given their periodicities.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer \( n \) (number of signs) followed by \( n \) integers representing the periodicities of the signs.
   - The output should be the year in which all signs occur sequentially for each test case.

2. **Function Summaries:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function processes a string `path` containing characters '@' and '*', and returns a value based on the presence of these characters. It does not relate to the problem at hand.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results of `func_1`.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** The function `func_1` is not relevant to the problem. It processes strings containing '@' and '*', which is unrelated to the periodicities of the signs.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases. However, it calls `func_1` instead of a function that would solve the actual problem.

Given that the problem requires calculating the year in which all signs occur sequentially based on their periodicities, and the provided code does not implement this logic, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to determine the year in which all signs will occur sequentially based on their periodicities. Instead, it processes irrelevant strings and calls a function that does not solve the problem.
