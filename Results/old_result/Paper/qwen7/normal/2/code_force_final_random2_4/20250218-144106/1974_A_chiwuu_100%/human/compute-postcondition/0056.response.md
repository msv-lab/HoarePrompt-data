Postcondition: `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is now equal to `b`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is now an integer value of the original `b`, `a` is converted to an integer from the user input `a`. If `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2; otherwise, `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`.
