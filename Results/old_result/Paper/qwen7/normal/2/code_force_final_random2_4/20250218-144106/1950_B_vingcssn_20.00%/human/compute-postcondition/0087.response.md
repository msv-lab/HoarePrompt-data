Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is assigned the value of `c + 1`, but since the initial value of `c` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an integer input, but its value is not specified.

The print statement `print('No esta en el rango')` simply outputs a string. Since no variables or objects are being referenced in this print statement, only the string itself is printed.

Output: **No esta en el rango**
