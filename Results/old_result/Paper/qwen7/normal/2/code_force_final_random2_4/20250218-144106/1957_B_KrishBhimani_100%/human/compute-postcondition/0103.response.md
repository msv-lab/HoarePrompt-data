Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is the final value determined by the loop (either the number of times the loop executed or one less than that), `ans` is a list containing `(1 << i) - 1`, and `temp` is 2 if `temp * 2 >= k` after the last iteration of the loop, otherwise `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`. Here, `1 << i` represents `2^i`, and subtracting 1 gives us a binary number consisting of `i` ones. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains as described above.
