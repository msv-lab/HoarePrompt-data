Output State: **`a` is a non-empty iterable, `val` is the next element in `a`, `cnt` is increased by 2, `op` is updated based on the next iteration, `op ^= val >> i & 1` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` based on the bitwise operations involving `val`, `i`, and the current value of `op`. Since `val` is the next element in `a`, `i` is not defined in the initial state, and the exact value of `op` before this operation is not specified, we keep these variables as they are, noting that `op` has been updated according to the given operation. The other variables (`a`, `val`, `cnt`) remain unchanged except for `cnt` which is increased by 2.
