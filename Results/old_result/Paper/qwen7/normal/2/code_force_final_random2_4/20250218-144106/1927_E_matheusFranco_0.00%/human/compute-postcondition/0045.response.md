Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)' and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`, `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`, making it `i + 2k`. The conditions and the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` remain the same as the initial state. The value of `curr_v` is also updated to `curr_v + 1`, but since the exact value of `curr_v` was not specified, it is represented as `curr_v + 1`.
