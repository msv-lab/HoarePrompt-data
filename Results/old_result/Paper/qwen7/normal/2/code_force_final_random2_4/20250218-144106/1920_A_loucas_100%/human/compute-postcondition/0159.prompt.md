Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is 0, `no` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` remains empty, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `x` is the last value read from the loop and it is not 1 or 2, `a` is the last value read from the loop and it is not in `less` or `big`, and the current value of `num` is either less than or equal to 0, or `num` is exactly 0 and `x` is not 1 or 2 and `a` is not in `less` or `big`, `innerLoop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num` is 0, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `less` is either a list containing `a` or an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` remains empty, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `x` is the integer value of the first input, `a` is the integer value of the second input, and both `x` and `a` are not 1 or 2, and `x` is either 1 or not 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is 0, `no` is a list containing `a` or is empty, `less` is a list containing `a` or is empty, `big` is a list containing `a` or is empty, `no` remains empty, `iterable2` is `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is the integer value of the first input, `a` is the integer value of the second input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is 0, `no` is a list containing `a`, `less` and `big` can either contain `a` or remain empty, `no` remains empty, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is the integer value of the first input, `a` is the integer value of the second input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
