Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `palka`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable that will take on values from the list `palka`.
   - `palka`: This is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `palka`.
   - The loop will stop when `i` has iterated through all elements of `palka`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each element in `palka`, the list `palka` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will change with each iteration, but initially, it should be set to the first element of `palka`.

Given the above points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the list `palka` contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first element of `palka`**
