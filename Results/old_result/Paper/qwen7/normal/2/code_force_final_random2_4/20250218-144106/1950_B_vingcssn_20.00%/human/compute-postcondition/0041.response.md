Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `c` is updated to `c + 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.

The `print('##')` statement simply prints the string `##`.

Since no specific values are provided for `casos`, `t`, `c`, or `n`, these variables do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **##**
