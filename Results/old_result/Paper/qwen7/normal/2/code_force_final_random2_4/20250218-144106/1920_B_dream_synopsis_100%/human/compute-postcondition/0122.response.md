Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` contains `[sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` becomes `a[0]`. However, the value of `i + x - 1` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `x`, so it remains as `a[x]`. Therefore, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `ans` now contains the updated value of `sums`.
