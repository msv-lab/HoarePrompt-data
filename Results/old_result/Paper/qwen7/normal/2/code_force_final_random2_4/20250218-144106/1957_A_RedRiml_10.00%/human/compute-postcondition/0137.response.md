Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `d` will be a dictionary where each key from `palka` will have a value representing how many times that key appeared in `palka`. The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka`, with no duplicates.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop:
- The dictionary `d` will have keys corresponding to each unique integer in `palka`, with the values being the count of how many times each integer appeared in `palka`.
- The list `pl` will contain all distinct integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, without any repetitions.

This means that every integer in `palka` will appear exactly once in `pl`, and its count in `d` will reflect how often it appeared in the original list `palka`.
