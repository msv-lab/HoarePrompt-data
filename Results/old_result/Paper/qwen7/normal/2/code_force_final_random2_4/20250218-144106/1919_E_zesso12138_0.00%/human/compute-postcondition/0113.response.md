Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list of length \(2n + 1\) where each element is calculated based on the cumulative sum of its neighboring elements from the previous iteration, modulo `MOD`. Specifically, each element `dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2n\)) will be the sum of its left and right neighbors from the previous iteration's `dp` array, taken modulo `MOD`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`.

This means that after the loop completes, the `dp` array will represent the number of ways to reach each position in a modified random walk problem, starting from the middle (`dp[n]`) and considering moves to the left and right, with the results being accumulated over `n` iterations.
