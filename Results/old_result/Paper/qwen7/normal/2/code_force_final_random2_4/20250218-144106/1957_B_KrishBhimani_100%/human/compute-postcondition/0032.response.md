Output State: `i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 2, 4, 8, ..., up to the highest power of 2 less than `k`.

Explanation: The loop continues to double the value of `temp` as long as `temp * 2 < k`. Once `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`, the loop breaks. Therefore, `temp` will take on the value of the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`. Given that the loop starts with `temp = 1`, it will keep doubling until doubling it again would make it exceed `k`. Thus, `temp` will be set to the largest power of 2 less than `k`. The values of `i`, `l1`, `n`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
