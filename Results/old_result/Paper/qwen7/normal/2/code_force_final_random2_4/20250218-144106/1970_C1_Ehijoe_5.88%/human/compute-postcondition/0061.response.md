Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `tree` has `v` appended to its left end.**

The code `tree.appendleft(v)` appends the value of `v` to the left end of the `tree` list. Since `v` is an input integer, the exact value of `v` is not specified, but it is known that it has been added to the left end of `tree`. The other variables remain unchanged.
