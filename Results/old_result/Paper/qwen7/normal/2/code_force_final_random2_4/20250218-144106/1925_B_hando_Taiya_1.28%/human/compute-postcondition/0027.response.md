Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `isqrt(x) + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the maximum of its original value (0) and `i` if `x % i == 0` and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is \(x // i\).

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus 1.
   - `n` will be updated to \(x // \text{new\_value\_of\_i}\).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless the new condition `x % \text{new\_value\_of\_i} == 0` and `n \leq x // \text{new\_value\_of\_i}` is met.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `n` becomes `x // (i + 1)`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`ans` is the maximum of its original value (0) and `i` if `x % i == 0` and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `i` is incremented by 1 to become `i + 1`, and `n` is \(x // (i + 1)\).**
