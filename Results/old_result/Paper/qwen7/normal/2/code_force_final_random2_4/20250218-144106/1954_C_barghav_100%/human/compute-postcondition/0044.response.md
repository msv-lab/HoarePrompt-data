Output State: **`a[i]` is now equal to the original value of `b[i]`; `b[i]` is now equal to the original value of `a[i]`; `f` retains its original value; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code swaps the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This operation is performed regardless of the value of `f` and the relationship between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. After swapping, `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `f` remains unchanged as the swap does not depend on its value.
