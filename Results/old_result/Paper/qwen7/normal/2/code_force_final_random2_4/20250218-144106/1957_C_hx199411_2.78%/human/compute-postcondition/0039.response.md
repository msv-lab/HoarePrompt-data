Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not, `m` is a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1.**

The code sets `dp[1]` to 1, which initializes the first element of the `dp` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
