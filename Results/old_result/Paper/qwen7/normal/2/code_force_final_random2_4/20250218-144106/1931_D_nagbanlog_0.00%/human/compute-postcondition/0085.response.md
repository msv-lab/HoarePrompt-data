Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_y) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_y` to `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `mod_x` remains as `num % x`, and `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are calculated based on the updated `mod_y`.
