Output State: **`op` is updated by performing the bitwise XOR operation between its current value (False) and the result of `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1; `cnt` is 3; `val` is the first element of the list `a` and `a` must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `op`, `val`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
