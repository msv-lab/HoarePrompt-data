The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). It uses a binary search approach to find the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price (`b`) in order to maximize profit. The function returns the highest profit found during the iterations, along with the final lower and upper bounds (`low` and `high`) of the search range.
