Output State: `i` is 'F', `p` remains 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is 'mmm' because for each iteration of the loop, when `i` (which cycles through 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F') is not in `hmp`, `ans` increments by `m`. Since `hmp` does not contain any of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F', `ans` will increment by `m` six times, resulting in `ans` being equal to 'mmm'.
