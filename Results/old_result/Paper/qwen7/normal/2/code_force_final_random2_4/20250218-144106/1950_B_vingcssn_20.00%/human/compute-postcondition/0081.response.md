Output: **..##..##**

Explanation: The initial state provides information about the variables `casos`, `c`, `t`, and `n`. However, the `print` statement itself does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'..##..##'`. Since no variables are involved in this particular print statement, the output is simply the string `'..##..##'`.
