Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`. The function ensures that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^6 and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^6. It returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a series of test cases, each containing values for `n` and `m`, and performs some operation or checks conditions on these values before returning a result. However, without the specific logic inside the function, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.
