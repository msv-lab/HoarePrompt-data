Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` retain their initial states or are updated according to the if-else conditions.
- The loop condition is `low <= high`.

### Loop Body:
- If `profit_next > profit_mid`, then `low` becomes `mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, `high` becomes `mid - 1`.
- `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the return values of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` respectively.
- `max_profit` is the maximum value between `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.

### Analysis:
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must still hold true. This means that either `low` should not exceed `high` after the adjustments, or the loop will terminate.

### Adjustments Needed:
- If `profit_next > profit_mid`, then `low` becomes `mid + 1`. For the loop to continue, `mid + 1` must be less than or equal to `high`.
- If `profit_next <= profit_mid`, then `high` becomes `mid - 1`. For the loop to continue, `mid - 1` must be greater than or equal to `low`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that the loop continues based on the current values of `low` and `high`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition `low <= high`. Therefore, no specific adjustments are needed to the states of `low` and `high` as long as they satisfy this condition. However, we need to ensure that the loop head variables (`low`, `high`) are such that the loop can continue.

### Final Answer:
State: **`low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` must satisfy the condition `low <= high`.**

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time.
