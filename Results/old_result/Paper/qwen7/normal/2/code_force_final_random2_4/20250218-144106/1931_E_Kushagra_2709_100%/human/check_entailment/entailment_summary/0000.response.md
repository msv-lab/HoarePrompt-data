Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_1` aligns with the rules and conditions of the game described in the problem statement.

1. **Game Rules Recap**:
   - Players take turns.
   - Anna reverses the digits of an element.
   - Sasha concatenates two elements and removes one.
   - The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, meaning there is exactly one number left.
   - Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The game's outcome depends on the total length of the numbers after Anna's moves and before Sasha's moves.
   - The function `zerocnts` calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number, which is used in the sorting process within `func_1`.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - `tot` is calculated as the sum of the lengths of the string representations of all numbers in `nums`.
   - `cntvals` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in each number, sorted in descending order.
   - Every second element in `cntvals` is subtracted from `tot`. This step seems to be aimed at simulating the effect of Sasha's moves, where he can reduce the total length by combining two numbers.
   - The condition `if tot >= m + 1` checks if the remaining length is sufficient for Sasha to win.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game's progression by considering the total length of numbers and the impact of Sasha's moves.
   - The use of trailing zero counts helps in estimating the potential reduction in length due to concatenation.
   - The final check `if tot >= m + 1` accurately determines the winner based on the remaining length.

Given that the logic in `func_1` correctly implements the game's rules and conditions, the provided implementation appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
