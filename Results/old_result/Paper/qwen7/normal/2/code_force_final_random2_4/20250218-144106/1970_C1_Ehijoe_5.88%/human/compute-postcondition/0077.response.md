Output State: **`start` is an input integer, `i` is `start-1`, the deque `tree` is empty, `idx` is an error because `tree` is empty, `moves` is `[min(start-1, idx), min(start-1, n - idx - 1)]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `moves` as a list containing two elements. The first element is `min(start-1, idx)`, and the second element is `min(start-1, n - idx - 1)`. Since `idx` is an error due to the empty deque `tree`, its value remains undefined. The value of `start` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be used to compute the second element of `moves`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `moves` list and retains the unchanged variables.
