Output State: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration based on the conditions described, and `i` is the last element in the list `results`.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` remains as the input integer, `arr` remains as the string input by the user. The list `results` will contain a 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration of the loop, depending on whether `n` is odd and if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D'. The variable `i`, which starts at 99 and decreases by 1 in each iteration, will be the last element in the `results` list after the loop completes.
