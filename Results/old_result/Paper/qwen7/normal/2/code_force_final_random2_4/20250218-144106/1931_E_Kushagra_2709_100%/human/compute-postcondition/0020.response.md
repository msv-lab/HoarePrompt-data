Output State: **`The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the integer 'num'`**

This is because the loop iterates through the string `num` from the end to the beginning, counting the number of trailing zeros (each time it encounters a '0', it increments `tot`). Once a non-zero digit is found, the loop breaks, and `i` is set to the index of that non-zero digit, but `tot` retains the count of trailing zeros. The return statement then returns this count.
