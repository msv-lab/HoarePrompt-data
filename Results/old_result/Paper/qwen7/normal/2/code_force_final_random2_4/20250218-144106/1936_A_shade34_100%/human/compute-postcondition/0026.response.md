Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable in the given code is `i`.
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations, where `n` is a predefined value.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables:**
   - `mak` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive).
   - `mak2` equals `mak`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop executed.
   - `pans` is an empty list.

3. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the loop variable `i` must start from 0 and go up to `n-1`.
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 at the beginning of the loop.
   - The value of `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Combine the Adjusted States:**
   - We need to adjust the initial state of `i` to be 0.
   - Ensure that `n` is at least 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
