Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `t` is increased by `s`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by the value of `s`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k` still holds true.
