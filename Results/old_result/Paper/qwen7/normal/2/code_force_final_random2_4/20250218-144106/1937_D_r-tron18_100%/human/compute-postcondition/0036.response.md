Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[i]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `zr` is greater than `ol`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `zeroInd` using the function calls `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` and `func_1(suffZero, 1)`. The values of `s1[i]`, `suffZero`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `zeroInd` is determined by the given formula, but the exact value depends on the implementation of `func_1`. The precondition that `zr` is greater than `ol` remains valid.
