Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `v2` is 2
   - If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is also set to 2 (but this does not affect the loop condition)
   - No change in `r` and no other variables are affected

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3 (i.e., `i = i + 1`).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` becomes 3
   - `v2` remains 2
   - `r` remains unchanged
   - `v1` remains unchanged (since it was only set if `r` was '<' and there is no information that `r` changed)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `v2` is 2, `r` must be unchanged, `v1` must be unchanged**
