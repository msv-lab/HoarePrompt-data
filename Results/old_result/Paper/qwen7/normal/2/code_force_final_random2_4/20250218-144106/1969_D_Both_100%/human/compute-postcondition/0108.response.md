Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop will continue as long as the `combined` list is not empty.

2. **Check the current state**: 
   - `current_profit` remains 0.
   - `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`.
   - `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined`.
   - `remaining_items` is an empty list.
   - `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.
   - `n` is the return value of `func_2()`.
   - `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: For the loop to execute at least once, `combined` must not be empty. Since `combined` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `combined` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to make sure that `combined` is not empty before the loop starts. Given the current state, there is no information indicating that `combined` is empty, but we need to ensure it is not empty for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `combined` is not empty.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is not empty**
