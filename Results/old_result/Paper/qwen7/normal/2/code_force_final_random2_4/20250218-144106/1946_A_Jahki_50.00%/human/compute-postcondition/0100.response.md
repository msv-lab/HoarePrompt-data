Output State: **`total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is op + 1, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `b` is a sorted version of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b` which was already sorted previously. Since sorting the same list again does not change its order, the values of `b` remain the same as they were before. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
