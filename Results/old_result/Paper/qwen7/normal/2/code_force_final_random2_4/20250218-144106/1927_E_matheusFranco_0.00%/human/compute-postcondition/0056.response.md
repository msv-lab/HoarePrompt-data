Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns None since the parameters n and k are not passed as arguments within the function definition.**

Given the constraints, the function should ideally accept parameters `n` and `k`, but the provided function definition does not include any parameters. Therefore, the function does not perform any operation related to the given constraints and simply returns `None`.
