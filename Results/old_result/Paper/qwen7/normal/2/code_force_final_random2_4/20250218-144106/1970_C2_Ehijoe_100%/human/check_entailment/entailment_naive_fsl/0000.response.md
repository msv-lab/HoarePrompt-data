Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not follow the rules of the game described in the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is intended to check if a node has any inactive neighbors. However, its implementation is flawed. It checks if the node has more than one neighbor and if one of those neighbors is the parent node. If so, it returns `False`, indicating that the node does not have any inactive neighbors. This logic does not align with the game's rules, where a player can move a stone to any inactive neighbor, regardless of whether the parent node is active or not.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input and calls `func_1` to determine the winner. However, `func_1` is not correctly implemented as explained above. Additionally, the function does not simulate the game rounds or handle the alternating moves between Ron and Hermione. Instead, it seems to be checking if a node has any inactive neighbors, which is not relevant to the game's outcome.

To correctly determine the winner, the program needs to simulate the game rounds and alternate moves between the two players. The function should keep track of the active nodes and determine the winner based on whether a player can make a valid move. The current implementation does not achieve this.

For example, consider a simple tree with 5 nodes and one round starting from node 1:
```
1 -- 2 -- 3
|         |
4 -- 5
```
- If the stone starts at node 1, Ron can move it to node 2, then Hermione can move it to node 4, and Ron can move it to node 5. In this case, Hermione would win.
- However, the provided program does not simulate these moves and instead checks for inactive neighbors, which is not relevant to the game's outcome.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and is incorrect.
