Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the total number of distinct elements across the sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` by taking the sum of their lengths. No other variables are affected. The conditions and values of the sets `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, and `results` remain unchanged. The `results` list may have additional elements 'NO' or 'YES' appended based on the condition, but this is not reflected in the value of `total_distinct`.
