Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The logic in `func_1` tries to find a specific pattern to form the smallest string but it does not handle all possible cases.
   - Specifically, the program checks for a specific condition (`if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`) which is too restrictive and does not cover all scenarios needed to find the lexicographically smallest string.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Paths:**
   - The calculation of the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. The current implementation only checks for a prefix match, which is not sufficient to count all valid paths.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use dynamic programming to keep track of the lexicographically smallest string and the number of ways to achieve it. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = [input() for _ in range(2)]
    
    # Initialize DP tables
    dp = [[defaultdict(int) for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(3)]
    dp[0][0][''] = 1  # Base case: starting point
    
    # Fill DP table
    for i in range(2):
        for j in range(n):
            for prev in dp[i][j]:
                if prev == '':
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1][prev + a[i][j]] += dp[i][j][prev]
                else:
                    if a[i][j] == '0':
                        dp[i + 1][j + 1][prev + a[i][j]] += dp[i][j][prev]
                    elif a[i][j] == '1' and prev[-1] == '0':
                        dp[i + 1][j + 1][prev + a[i][j]] += dp[i][j][prev]
    
    # Find the lexicographically smallest string
    min_str = ''
    for s in dp[2][n]:
        if (min_str == '' or s < min_str):
            min_str = s
    
    # Count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string
    count = 0
    for s in dp[2][n]:
        if s == min_str:
            count += dp[2][n][s]
    
    print(min_str)
    print(count)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to build up the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that produce it.
