Postcondition: `D[out_aa]` is greater than or equal to -7, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `m` is incremented by 1, `fnd` is updated based on the condition involving `pairs_in_D`, `n` remains unchanged, `in_aa` is the next element in the slice `aa[m+1:]`, `out_aa` is the corresponding element in the slice `aa[:n - (m + 1)]`, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D`, and `C` remain unchanged.
