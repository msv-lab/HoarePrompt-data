You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t (the number of test cases), n (the size of the set), and k (an integer within the set). For each test case, it calculates a list of integers and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. The list contains all integers from 1 to 20, excluding the integer at index `i`, where `i` is determined based on the value of `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an index `i` to 0.
   - The loop `while 1 << i + 1 <= k:` finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This is stored in `i`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed as follows:
     - `ans[0] = k - (1 << i)` ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed using this element alone.
     - `ans[1] = k + 1` ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + 1`.
     - `ans[2] = k + 1 + (1 << i)` ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
     - For the remaining indices, it appends powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19` (up to 20 elements).

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is printed.
   - The sequence `ans` is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The element `k - (1 << i)` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` because adding any other element would result in a sum greater than `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Other Values:**
   - The sequence includes all powers of 2 up to `1 << 19`, which covers a wide range of sums.
   - By combining these powers of 2, any value from 1 to `n` (where `n` is large enough to cover the range) can be formed as a subsequence sum.

3. **Sequence Length:**
   - The sequence length is fixed at 23 (3 predefined elements + 20 powers of 2).
   - Since the problem allows sequences of length up to 25, this fits within the constraint.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other values from 1 to `n` to be formed as subsequence sums.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
