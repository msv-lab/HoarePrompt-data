Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `r` is a string, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 2, and `prev` remains unchanged (still 0)**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. Since no variables are modified, the initial state remains unchanged.
