Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is an integer value of `b`, `a` is input from the user, `b` is input from the user, and the values of `t1`, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `b` are updated according to the new inputs `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = input().split()` takes two inputs from the user and splits them into `a` and `b`. The values of `t1`, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged in terms of their definitions but now `a` and `b` have specific values based on the user's input. The value of `t1` is still defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t` is still defined as either `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0. The variable `n` is still greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is still incremented by 1.
