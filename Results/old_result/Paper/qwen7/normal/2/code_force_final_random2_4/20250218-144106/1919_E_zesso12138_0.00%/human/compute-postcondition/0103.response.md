Output State: **`new_dp[j + 1]' is updated to (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD, `j` is the previous `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to its current value and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The value of `j` remains as the previous `j + 1`, and the condition that `n` is greater than 0 is still valid.
