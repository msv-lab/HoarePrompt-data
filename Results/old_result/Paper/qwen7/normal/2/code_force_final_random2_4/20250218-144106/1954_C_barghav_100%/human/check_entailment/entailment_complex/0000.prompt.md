Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: After all iterations, `a` and `b` will contain the characters from the respective strings such that each character in `a` is either equal to or greater than the corresponding character in `b`, and `f` will be 1 if any swap occurred during the loop execution; otherwise, it will remain 0.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: `a` and `b` are strings, `i` is 4, `f` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs for each index in the range defined by `len(a)`. Since the output state after 3 iterations shows that `i` is 2, it means the loop has completed 3 iterations so far. Therefore, the total number of characters in string `a` is 4 (since `i` starts from 0). The loop continues until `i` reaches the length of `a`, which is 4. Given that no swaps (`f`) have occurred throughout the iterations (as `f` remains 0), the final value of `i` will be 4 after all iterations are complete.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: `a` and `b` are strings, `i` is 4, `b` must have a length of 4.
    #
    #Explanation: Given that the loop runs as long as `i` is less than the length of `b`, and since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the loop will run until `i` equals the length of `b`. From the initial state, we know `i` is 4, and after 3 iterations, `b` still has a length of 3. This means the loop has just completed its 3rd iteration, and `i` is now 3. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` will reach 4, which is equal to the length of `b`, and the loop will terminate. Thus, the final length of `b` will be 4, and `i` will be 4 after all iterations are complete.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, where both strings represent integers of the same length consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It ensures that each character in string `a` (initially set to `x`) is either equal to or greater than the corresponding character in string `b` (initially set to `y`). If any swap occurs during the process, a flag `f` is set to 1. After processing, the function prints both strings `a` and `b`. The final state of the program is that both strings `a` and `b` are printed, and the variable `i` is set to the length of the strings.
