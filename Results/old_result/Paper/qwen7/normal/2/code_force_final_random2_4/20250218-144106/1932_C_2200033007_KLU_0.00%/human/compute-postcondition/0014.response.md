Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list with an additional element `a[l+1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from the original value to `l+1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `n` remains a positive integer, and `b` is a list with an additional element indexed at `l+1`.
