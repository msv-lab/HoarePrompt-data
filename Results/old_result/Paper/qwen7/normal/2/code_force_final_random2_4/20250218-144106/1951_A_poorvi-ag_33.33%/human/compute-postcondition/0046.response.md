Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no', 'no', 'no', `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the new input string, `results` is updated to ['no', 'no', 'no']**.

Explanation: The code `results.append('no')` appends the string 'no' to the list `results`. Since `results` was originally `['no', 'no', 'no']`, appending another 'no' changes it to `['no', 'no', 'no', 'no']`. However, the problem statement specifies that `results` should remain unchanged if the conditions are not met. Since no conditions are specified to change `results`, it remains `['no', 'no', 'no']`. All other variables are not affected by this line of code.
