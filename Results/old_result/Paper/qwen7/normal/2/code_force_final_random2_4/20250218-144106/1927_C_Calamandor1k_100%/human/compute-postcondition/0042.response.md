Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list now contains 'YES'**.

The code `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. This does not affect the values of `total_distinct`, `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. The condition for updating the `results` list based on `total_distinct` and `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is still stored in `total_distinct`, and the `results` list now includes `'YES'`.
