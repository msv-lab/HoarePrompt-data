Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when the hour is 00 or 12. Here's why:

1. When `h` is 0, it should be printed as 12 and the day should still be 'AM', but the current implementation incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' and prints `h` as 12.
2. When `h` is 12, it should remain 12 and the day should be 'PM', but the current implementation incorrectly changes `day` to 'PM' when `h` is 12 regardless of the original value of `day`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

This corrected version ensures that the hour is correctly adjusted and the day indicator is set properly.
