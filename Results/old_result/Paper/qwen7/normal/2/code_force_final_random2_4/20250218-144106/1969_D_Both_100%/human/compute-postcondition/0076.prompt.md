Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `test_cases` remains a positive integer, `heap` contains all elements from `combined` after each has been popped once (i.e., `k` times), `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `neg_prices` remains a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` remains a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` remains the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is 0, `max_profit` is equal to the maximum of its original value and `current_profit`, and `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `current_profit` is updated based on the condition `removed_item[0] + removed_item[1] >= 0`; if true, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[1]`, otherwise increased by `removed_item[0]`; `heap` is modified by pushing `removed_item` and popping the smallest element; `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order with the last item popped; `removed_item` is true; if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `item` is the second last element of `combined`, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `removed_item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit` becomes greater than `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `item` is the removed_item, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit` becomes greater than `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
