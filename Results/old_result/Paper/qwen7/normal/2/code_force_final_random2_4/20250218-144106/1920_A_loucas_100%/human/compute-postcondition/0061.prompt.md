Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the if-else block executes, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the input, `big` contains all the values of `a` where `x == 1` was true, `less` contains all the values of `a` where `x == 2` was true, `no` contains all the values of `a` where `x != 2` was true, and `num` is equal to `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. If `num < 1`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, no change is made to the variables.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `no` must contain at least one element. If the current value of `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value of the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value of the `big` list, then `num` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next element in the list `no`, `no` must contain at least one element, `less` is a list with a minimum value, `big` is a list with a maximum value, and `num` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next element in the list `no`, `no` must contain at least one element, `less` is a list with a minimum value, `big` is a list with a maximum value, and `num` is decremented by 1. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` remains `num - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
