Output State: **`less` is an empty list, `num` remains unchanged, `big` retains its final state, `no` retains its final state**.

The code initializes an empty list named `less`. This does not affect the values of `num`, `big`, or `no`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states, while `less` is now an empty list.
