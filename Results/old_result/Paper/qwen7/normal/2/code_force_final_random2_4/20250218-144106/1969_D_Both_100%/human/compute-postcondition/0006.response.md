Output State: **`test_cases` must be a positive integer, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code creates a new list `neg_prices` which contains the negative values of each element in the original `prices` list. The values of `test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
