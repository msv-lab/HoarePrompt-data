Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `k` as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. Since the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are inputted by the user, `k` is determined based on these inputs. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
