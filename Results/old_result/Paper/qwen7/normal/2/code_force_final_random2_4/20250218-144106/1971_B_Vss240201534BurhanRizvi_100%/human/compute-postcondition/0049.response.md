Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism. After all iterations of the loop, `s2` will be determined based on the following rules:
- If the length of `s` is 1, `s2` remains `s`.
- If `s` consists of all the same characters and has a length greater than 1, `s2` is the string `s` rotated by one character to the left.
- Otherwise, `s2` is a random permutation of the string `s`.**

This means that after all the iterations of the loop, depending on the input string `s`, `s2` will either remain as `s` if its length is 1, be a left rotation of `s` if it consists of identical characters and has more than one character, or be a random permutation of `s` otherwise.
