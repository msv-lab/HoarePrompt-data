Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or `zeroes - cnt[0]` + 1, depending on whether the second character in the list `s` is 0 or not; `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s` plus 1; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `cnt` is [1, 2]; `c` is the second character in the list `s` and its count in `cnt` is increased by 1.
