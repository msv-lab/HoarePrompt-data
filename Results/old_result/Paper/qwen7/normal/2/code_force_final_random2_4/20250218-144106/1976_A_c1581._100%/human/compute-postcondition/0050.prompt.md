You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string of length 1 <= n <= 20, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `password` is processed such that all its digits are collected into the `digits` list, and all its letters are collected into the `letters` list.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The `letters` list is a sorted list, `i` is equal to the length of `digits`, and `digits` is a list. No conditions inside the loop have triggered a return statement, meaning that the loop has completed all its iterations without encountering any breaking conditions. Therefore, the function has successfully iterated over all elements in `digits` (and `letters` up to index `i-1`), and no early returns have been made based on the given conditions.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter password, which is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, containing only lowercase Latin letters or digits. The function returns True if the password meets specific conditions, otherwise it returns False.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns False

Case_2: The program returns False

Case_3: The program returns False

Case_4: The program returns False

Case_5: The program returns False

Case_6: The program returns False

Case_7: The program returns True

Case_8: The program returns False


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
