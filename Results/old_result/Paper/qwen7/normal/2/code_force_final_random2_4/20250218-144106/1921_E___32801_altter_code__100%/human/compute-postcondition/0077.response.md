Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is 1, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5] - (m - y1)`, `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `c` is `r[5] - m`**.

Explanation: The code `c = y2 - 1` updates the value of `c`. Given that `y2` is defined as `r[5] - (m - y1)` and `y1` is 1, we can substitute these values to find that `c` is `r[5] - m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
