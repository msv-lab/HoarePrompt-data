Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to `n-2`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Given that `i` starts at `n-2`, the loop will execute for `i = n-2, n-3, ..., 1`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: To ensure the loop starts executing, `i` should be set to `1` (the starting value of the loop).

5. **Adjust the state of `n`**: Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, `n` must be at least `2` to ensure there is at least one iteration.

6. **Other variables**: The other variables (`k`, `l`, `ans1`, and `b`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
