Output State: The list `tree` will contain all the integers from 1 to `n` in some order, and the variable `i` will be `n-1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `i=0` to `i=n-1`), the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`. The list `tree` will have been populated with all integers from 1 to `n` based on the conditions provided within the loop. Each iteration processes a pair of integers `(u, v)` and updates the `tree` deque according to the specified rules. Since the loop runs `n-1` times, it will process `n-1` pairs of integers, effectively filling the `tree` with all integers from 1 to `n`. The exact order of these integers in `tree` may vary depending on the specific values of `u` and `v` provided by the input during each iteration.
