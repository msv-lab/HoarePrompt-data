Output State: **`i` is 1, `mak` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The precondition that `pans` must have at least 2 elements and the input being a string equal to '>' remains valid but is not affected by the code snippet provided.
