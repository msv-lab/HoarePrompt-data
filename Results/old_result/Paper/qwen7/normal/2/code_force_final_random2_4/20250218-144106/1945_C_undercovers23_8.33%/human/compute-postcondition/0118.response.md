Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is either 0 or 1, and `lst` contains the value 3; `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (3 + 1)) which results in 50.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains 3. Since `zero` is either 1 or 2, `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Given `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 4)`. For `zero` being 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(1 * 100 / 4)` which is 25, but since the initial condition states `zero_perc` is 50, `zero` must be 2. For `zero` being 2, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(2 * 100 / 4)` which is 50. All other variables remain unchanged.
