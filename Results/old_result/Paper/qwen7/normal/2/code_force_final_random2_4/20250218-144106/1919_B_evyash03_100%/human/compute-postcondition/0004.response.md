Output State: **`count` is 1, `expression` is a non-empty string of length `length`, `char` is the first character in `expression` and equals '+', the current value of `length` is the length of `expression`.**

The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Initially, `count` is 0, so after executing this line, `count` becomes 1. The values of `expression`, `char`, and `length` remain unchanged from their initial states.
