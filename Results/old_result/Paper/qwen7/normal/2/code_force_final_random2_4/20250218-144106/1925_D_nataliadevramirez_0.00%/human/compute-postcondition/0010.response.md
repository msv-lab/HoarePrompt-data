Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `m` is the second input integer.
- `k` is the third input integer.
- `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains two integers resulting from converting input strings to integers.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

The code snippet only contains a `print(result)` statement, which means it will print the value returned by the function `func_1`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the output of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
