State: **`mak` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < n`.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because if `n` is 1 or less, the range `range(1, n)` will not generate any values, and the loop will not execute.
4. The variable `mak` is not used in the loop condition or initialization, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` should start from 1.
