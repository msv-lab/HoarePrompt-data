Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `c` is `l[0] * s - s * s / 2`
   - `k` is `k - s`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop condition is `i < n`, after the first iteration, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must remain greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - The values of `c` and `k` do not change within the loop head and are not affected by the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is `l[0] * s - s * s / 2`, `k` is `k - s`**
