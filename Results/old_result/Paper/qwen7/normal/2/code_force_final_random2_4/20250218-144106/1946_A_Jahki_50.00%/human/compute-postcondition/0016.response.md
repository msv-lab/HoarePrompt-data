Output State: **`op` is 0, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an even number less than or equal to 10000, `case` is the input string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is (`num2` / 2) - 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns `ma` the value of `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. Since `num2` is an even number, `int(num2 / 2)` will be half of `num2` rounded down to the nearest integer. Subtracting 1 from this value gives us the final value of `ma`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
