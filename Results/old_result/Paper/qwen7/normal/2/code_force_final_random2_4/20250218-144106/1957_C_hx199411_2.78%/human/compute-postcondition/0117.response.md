Output State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is 3, `i` is 1, `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input**

Explanation: The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given that `num` was initially either 1 or 2, adding 2 to it results in `num` being 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
