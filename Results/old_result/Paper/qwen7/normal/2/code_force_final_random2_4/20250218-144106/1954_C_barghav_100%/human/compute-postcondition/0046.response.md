Postcondition: **`a[i]` and `b[i]` are elements from arrays `a` and `b` respectively. If `f` equals 0, swapping `a[i]` and `b[i]` occurs. If `f` is 1 and `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` swap their values, `f` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `f` is 1 and `a[i]` is not less than `b[i]`, `f` retains its original value, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` keep their original values. If `f` is 1 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `a[i]` is set to the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i]` is set to the original value of `a[i]`, `f` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
