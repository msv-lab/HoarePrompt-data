Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `mexsize` is 1, the final value of `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `t` remains unchanged, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code sets `mexsize` to 1. This does not affect the values of `a`, `tc`, `n`, `t`, or `maxsize`. The value of `mexsize` is now explicitly set to 1, and it will be updated later based on the elements in the list `a`.
