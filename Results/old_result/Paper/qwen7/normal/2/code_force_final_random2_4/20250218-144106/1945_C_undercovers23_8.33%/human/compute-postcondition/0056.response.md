Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `lst`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ele` is iterating through `lst`, at the end of the previous iteration, `ele` would have taken the last value from `lst`.
   - For the next iteration, `ele` will take the next value in `lst`.
   - `lst` must still contain at least one element (since it must contain at least one element for the loop to start).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - next_ele)`, where `next_ele` is the next element in `lst`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `lst` must contain at least one element (to ensure the loop can continue).
- `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - next_ele)`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `next_ele`, we can represent it as `next_element` in the state description.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - next_element)`**
