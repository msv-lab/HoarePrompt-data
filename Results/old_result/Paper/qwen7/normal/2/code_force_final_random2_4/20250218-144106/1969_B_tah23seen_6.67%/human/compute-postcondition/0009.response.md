Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 0.**

The code `left = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `left`. This does not affect the values of `sChar`, `i`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `left` being set to 0.
