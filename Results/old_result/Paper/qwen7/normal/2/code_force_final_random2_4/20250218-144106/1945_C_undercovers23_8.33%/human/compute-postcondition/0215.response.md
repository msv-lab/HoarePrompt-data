Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `zero` is the total count of '0' in the string `s`, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is the total count of '1' in the string `s`, `one_perc` is 100, `lst` contains all indices `i+1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached `n-1`, indicating that every index in the string `s` has been processed. The counts of '0' (`zero`) and '1' (`one`) will reflect the total occurrences of these characters in the string. Both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` will be 100 because the entire string has been considered, making the percentages of '0' and '1' 100%. The list `lst` will contain all indices `i+1` where the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` were met during the loop's execution.
