Output State: **`h` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18} and n ≥ k; `k` is a positive integer; `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and `costs` remain unchanged from their initial states.
