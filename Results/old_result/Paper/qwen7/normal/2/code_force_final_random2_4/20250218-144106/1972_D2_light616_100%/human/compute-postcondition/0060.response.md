Output State: `x` is 3, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\). Given the initial state and the conditions, the loop increments `y` until these conditions are no longer satisfied. After the first three iterations, `y` is 4. Since \(\text{math.gcd}(3, 4) = 1\), `cnt` is incremented by 1. For the fourth iteration, \(x + y = 7\), and checking the conditions:

- \((7 \times 3) = 21 \not\leq n\) (assuming the smallest possible `n` which is 10)
- \((7 \times 4) = 28 \not\leq m\) (assuming the smallest possible `m` which is 20)

Thus, the loop terminates. Therefore, `y` becomes 5 (as it was incremented from 4), and `cnt` remains 1 because the condition for incrementing `cnt` was met only once.
