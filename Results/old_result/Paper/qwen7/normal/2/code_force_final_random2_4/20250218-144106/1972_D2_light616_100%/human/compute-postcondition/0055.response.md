Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is given by `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `x` is 3
   - `y` is 3
   - `n` is at least 10
   - `m` is at least 20
   - `cnt` is 2 (this state is not relevant to the loop condition)

3. **Evaluate Loop Condition**:
   - Calculate `(x + y) * x`: 
     \[
     (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18
     \]
   - Check if `18 <= n`: Since `n` is at least 10, this part of the condition is satisfied.
   - Calculate `(x + y) * y`: 
     \[
     (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18
     \]
   - Check if `18 <= m`: Since `m` is at least 20, this part of the condition is also satisfied.

Since both parts of the loop condition are satisfied, the loop can execute one more time. 

### Adjusting States:
- The loop condition depends on `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.
- We need to ensure that the loop can still satisfy the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` after the next iteration.

Given the current values:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 3
- `n` is at least 10
- `m` is at least 20

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to keep the same values for `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` because any change would violate the loop condition unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Final State:
State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 3, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20**
