Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `zero` is the total count of '0's in the string `s`, `zero_perc` is 100 because `zero` is 100% of the processed portion of the string, `one` is the total count of '1's in the string `s`, `one_perc` is 0 because no more '1's will be processed once `i` reaches `n-1`, `lst` contains all positions where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` reached 50 simultaneously, which means it will contain a series of integers starting from 3 up to the last position where these conditions were met.

This final state indicates that the loop has iterated through the entire string `s`, updating counts of '0's and '1's, calculating percentages, and appending positions to `lst` whenever both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` reached 50%.
