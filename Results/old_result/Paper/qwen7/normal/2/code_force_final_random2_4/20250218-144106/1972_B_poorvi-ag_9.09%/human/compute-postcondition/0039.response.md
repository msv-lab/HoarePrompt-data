Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 99 (since the loop runs from 0 to t-1), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, and `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration based on the condition. If `n` is even, `results` contains 'no'. Otherwise, if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', `results` contains 'yes' and either 'yes' or 'no'. If the count of 'D' is greater than or equal to the count of 'U', `results` contains 'no'.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still hold the initial value it was given (an integer between 1 and 100), `i` will be 99 (as the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`), and `n` and `arr` will hold the last values input during the final iteration of the loop. The list `results` will contain the outcome ('yes' or 'no') for each of the `t` iterations, following the conditions specified in the loop body.
