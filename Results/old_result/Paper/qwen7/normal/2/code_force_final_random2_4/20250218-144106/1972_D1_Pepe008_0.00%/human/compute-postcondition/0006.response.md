Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i <= b`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `b` must be at least 1 (since the loop starts at `i = 1`).

3. **Consider the initial state given**:
   - `t` is 0.
   - `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\).
   - `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer.
   - `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer.
   - `suma` is 0.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `i` starting at 1 and incrementing up to `b`, `b` must be at least 1.
   - The value of `i` itself does not need to be adjusted since the loop will start with `i = 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `b` must be at least 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is 0**
