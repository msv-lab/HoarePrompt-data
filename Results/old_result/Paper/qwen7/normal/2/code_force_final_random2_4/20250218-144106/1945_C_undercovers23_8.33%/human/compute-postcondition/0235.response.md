Output State: **`lst` must have at least two elements, `pk` is unchanged, `mini` is unchanged, and `final` now contains one additional element `elem`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` to the list `final`. The conditions related to `pk` and `mini` remain unchanged, and the initial state of `lst` having at least two elements is also preserved.
