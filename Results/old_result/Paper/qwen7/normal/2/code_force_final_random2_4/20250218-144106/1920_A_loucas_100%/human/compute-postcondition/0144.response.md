Output State: **`num` is 0, `no` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing `a`, `big` is a list containing `a`, `no` remains empty, `iterable2` is `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is the integer value of the first input, `a` is the integer value of the second input.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Initially, `big` is an empty list. After appending `a`, `big` becomes a list containing `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
