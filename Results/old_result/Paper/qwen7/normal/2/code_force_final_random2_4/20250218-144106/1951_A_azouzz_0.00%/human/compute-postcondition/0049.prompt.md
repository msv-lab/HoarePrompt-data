Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `t` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the value of the input string, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. **If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, `cnt1` is greater than 2 and odd, or `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or odd.**

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If the string `s` contains '11', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if `cnt1` > 2 and (`cnt1` % 2 == 1 or `cnt1` == 1), the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If the string `s` contains '11', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If the string `s` does not contain '11', the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
