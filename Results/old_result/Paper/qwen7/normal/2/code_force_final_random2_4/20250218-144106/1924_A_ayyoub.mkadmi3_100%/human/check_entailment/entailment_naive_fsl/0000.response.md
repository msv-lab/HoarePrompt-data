Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string `s` is too short to contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that the string `s` is long enough to contain all required subsequences before checking for their presence.

For example, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 3 4
  abc
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  aaa
  ```

However, the program will output:
```
YES
```

This happens because the function `func_1` checks if `len(s1) >= n * k`, but it does not account for the fact that even if `len(s1)` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, it might still not contain all possible subsequences due to the distribution of characters in `s`. In this case, the string `abc` cannot form the subsequence `aaa`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the string `s` is long enough to contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This can be done by checking if `m` (the length of the string `s`) is at least `n * k / log(k, 26)` (since there are `26^k` possible strings of length `n` using `k` alphabets).
