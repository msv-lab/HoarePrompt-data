Based on the initial state provided:

- `L` is 33334
- `R` is 33335
- `numCuts` is 0
- `x` is 33334
- `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`

The loop continues to narrow down the range between `L` and `R` until the difference between them is no longer greater than 1. Given that `L` is 33334 and `R` is 33335, the difference between `L` and `R` is 1, which means the loop will stop here.

After the loop stops, `L` and `R` will be the same, both being 33334 and 33335 respectively. Since `numCuts` remains 0 and does not meet the condition to update `R`, the final value of `R` will be 33335 and `L` will remain 33334.

The `print(L)` statement will print the value of `L`.

Output: **33334**
