Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `xa` is an integer, `ya` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `x` is 0, `l` is `max(1, ya - 0)`, `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `min(w, yb + x)`. Given that `x` is 0, `r` simplifies to `min(w, yb)`. The values of `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `x`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
