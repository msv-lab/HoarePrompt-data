Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program simply counts the number of '+' characters and calculates the difference between the total length and this count, returning the absolute value of this difference. However, the problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The current implementation does not account for the optimal way to split the array.

The correct approach would involve finding the optimal way to split the array into subarrays where the sum of each subarray is zero or close to zero, as this would minimize the penalty. The current solution does not consider this and thus does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
