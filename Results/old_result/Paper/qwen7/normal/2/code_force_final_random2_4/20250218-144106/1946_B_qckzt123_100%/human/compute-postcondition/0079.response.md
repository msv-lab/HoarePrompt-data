Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 2, `t` is 4 % MOD, `ans` is `ans` % MOD**

Explanation: The line `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`. Since the initial value of `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`, and `t` is `4 % MOD`, the value of `ans` before this operation is already the remainder when `ans + 4` is divided by `MOD`. Therefore, `ans %= MOD` does not change the value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
