#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100, and b is a list of integers representing the values n_i where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list 'a'
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns a list of integers representing the values \(n_i\) where \(1 \leq n_i \leq 100\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of integers representing a strictly increasing sequence where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100, and `b`, a list of integers where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100. It returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a` if the condition `a <= b` is true. Otherwise, it returns a list of integers representing the values \(n_i\) where \(1 \leq n_i \leq 100\).
