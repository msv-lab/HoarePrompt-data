The only variables in the loop head are `h` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h` and `n`. The loop starts with `h` being 0 and `n` being an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `h` is 0, and `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * h`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `h` needs to be incremented by 1, so `h` becomes 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `h` must be less than `n`. Since `h` is now 1, `n` must still satisfy the condition 2 <= n <= 500.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`k` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `h` is 1, `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * h`**
