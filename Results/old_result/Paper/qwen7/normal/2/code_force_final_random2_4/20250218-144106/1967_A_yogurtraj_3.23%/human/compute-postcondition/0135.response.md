Given the initial state where `k` is an integer not equal to 0, and `r` is the sum of `a[n-1]` and `k` divided by `n`, we need to determine what will be printed by the statement `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

Let's break it down:

1. **Value of `r`:**
   - `r` is defined as \(\frac{a[n-1] + k}{n}\).
   - Here, `a[n-1]` is the last element of the list `a`, and `k` is an integer not equal to 0.
   - Therefore, `r` is the average of the last element of `a` and `k`, scaled by the factor of `1/n`.

2. **Expression to evaluate:**
   - The expression to evaluate is \((r - 1) * n + 1\).
   - Substituting the value of `r`, we get:
     \[
     (r - 1) * n + 1 = \left(\frac{a[n-1] + k}{n} - 1\right) * n + 1
     \]
   - Simplifying inside the parentheses:
     \[
     \frac{a[n-1] + k}{n} - 1 = \frac{a[n-1] + k - n}{n}
     \]
   - Multiplying by `n`:
     \[
     \left(\frac{a[n-1] + k - n}{n}\right) * n = a[n-1] + k - n
     \]
   - Adding 1:
     \[
     a[n-1] + k - n + 1 = a[n-1] + k - (n - 1)
     \]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to \(a[n-1] + k - (n - 1)\).

Output: **a[n-1] + k - (n - 1) (where a[n-1] is the last element of the list a, k is an integer not equal to 0, and n is the length of the list a)**
