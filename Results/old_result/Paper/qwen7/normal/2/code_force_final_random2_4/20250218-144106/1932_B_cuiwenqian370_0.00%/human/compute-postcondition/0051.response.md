Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `path` consisting of '@' and '*' characters. It calculates a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element depends on the previous elements based on the characters in `path`. If a character in `path` is '*', the corresponding `dp` element is set to `-inf`. If the character is '@', the `dp` element is incremented from the previous two elements. Finally, the function returns the maximum value among the `dp` elements that are not `-inf`. If no valid sequence exists, it returns 0.**
