Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `b` is an integer value of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` assigns the value of `t * 15 - b * 4` to `t1`. The values of `t`, `b`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. `t` is still either equal to `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0, and `n` is still greater than or equal to 1. `i` is incremented by 1, and `b` remains an integer value.
