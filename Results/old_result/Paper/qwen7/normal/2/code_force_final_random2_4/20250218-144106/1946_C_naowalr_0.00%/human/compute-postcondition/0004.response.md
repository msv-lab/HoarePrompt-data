Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted.
   - `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `n` is already defined as the first number inputted, we don't need to change its value.
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial state such that `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (since `i < n - 1` implies `n - 1 > 0`).

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
