Postcondition: `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated as follows:
- If `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, then `ans` is updated to `ans + 1`.
- If `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is not greater than 0, then `ans` remains the same.
- If `c` is not 0, then `ans` is updated to `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`.
- `zeroes` remains unchanged.
