Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 0**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Given the initial state where `o` is not defined but assumed to be `zero` (which is 1), `one` is not defined but assumed to be 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 2, the calculation simplifies to `math.ceil((1 - 0) * 100 / (n - 2 - 1)) = math.ceil(100 / (n - 3))`. Since `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 2, the smallest possible value for `n` is 3, making the denominator zero which is undefined. However, for any `n` greater than 3, the result will be 0 because the numerator is 100 and the denominator will be greater than 100. Thus, `one_perc` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
