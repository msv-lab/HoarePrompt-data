Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it sorts the list \( a \) and calculates a cumulative sum \( c \) based on the values in \( a \), the initial value \( t \), and the parameters \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \). Finally, it prints the computed sum \( c \) for each test case.**
