Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing (each element is less than or equal to the next). If `a` is non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'. If not, it checks if there exists a subsegment of `a` starting from index 1 that can be rearranged to form a non-decreasing sequence while maintaining the first element of `a`. If such a subsegment is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
