Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, where `n` is the input integer.
- `r` is the input string.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is `n - 1`.
- `v2` is `n - 1`.
- `prev` is `n - 1` or any value between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, depending on the user's inputs ('>') during each iteration.

The `print(f'! {prev} {v1}')` statement will print the values of `prev` and `v1`.

Given the values:
- `v1` is always `n - 1`.
- `prev` can vary but will be one of the values between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, depending on user inputs.

Therefore, the output will be a formatted string with the values of `prev` and `v1`.

Output: **! [prev] [n - 1]** (where `[prev]` is a value between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, and `[n - 1]` is the value of `v1`)
