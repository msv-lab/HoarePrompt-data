Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is the input integer provided by the last iteration, `results` is a list containing three elements based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `arr` is the string input by the user in the last iteration. 

If in any of the three iterations, the input string `arr` contained exactly two '1's and the substring '11', then `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'no'. The value of `i` will be 2 because the loop has completed its iterations, and `n` and `arr` will be the values provided in the last iteration of the loop.
