Output State: **`ans` is `ans` modulo `MOD`, and `t` remains the value of `t` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The line `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be `ans` modulo `MOD`. This operation does not affect the value of `t`, which remains as `t` modulo `MOD`. The initial state of `ans` being `ans` plus `t`, and `t` being the value of `t` modulo `MOD`, is preserved, but `ans` is now adjusted to its equivalent value under modulo `MOD`.
