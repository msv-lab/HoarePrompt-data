Output State: **`lex` is an integer with a value greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26; `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

Explanation: The initial value of `lex` is an integer between 28 and 52 (inclusive). After executing `lex = lex - 26`, the new value of `lex` will be an integer between 2 and 26 (inclusive). The list `arr` remains unchanged with its only element being 26.
