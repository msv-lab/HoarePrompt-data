Output State: **`lex` is an integer and `arr` contains the element 1**.

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(1)` appends the integer 1 to the list `arr`. This operation does not affect the value of `lex`. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, the conditions specified in the initial state are still valid. Therefore, the updated state is that `arr` now contains the element 1, and `lex` remains an integer with its original conditions applied.
