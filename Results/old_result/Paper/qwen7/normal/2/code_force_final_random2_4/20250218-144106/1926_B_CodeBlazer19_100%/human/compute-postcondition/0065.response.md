Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0
   - `b` is 'SQUARE'
   - `j` is 1
   - `s` is the input string from the user

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `j` in the range `range(n)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is `n + 1`, it does not affect the loop condition directly.
   - `t`, `a`, `b`, and `s` do not change within the loop and are not part of the loop head.

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.
   - The condition `j < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is `n + 1` (unchanged)
- `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 (unchanged)
- `b` is 'SQUARE' (unchanged)
- `j` is 2 (incremented by 1)
- `s` is the input string from the user (unchanged)

So, the updated state is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is 2, `s` is the input string from the user**
