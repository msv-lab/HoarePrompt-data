Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all input test cases are processed. After all iterations, `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values provided by the last input test case, and `k` will be the minimum value between the final `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a` at the last iteration, `k` will be the minimum value between the final `n` and `b - a`. Otherwise, `k` will also be the minimum value between the final `n` and `b - a`. The output of each iteration is determined based on the current values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, and `k` is recalculated for each new set of inputs.
