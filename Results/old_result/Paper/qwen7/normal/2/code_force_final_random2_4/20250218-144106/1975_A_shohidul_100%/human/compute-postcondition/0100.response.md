Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the input split by spaces, `check_all` is True if all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-2` are less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `check_all` is False.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `check_all` remain unchanged. The new state of `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input.
