Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of strings sorted in ascending order, `suma` is 0**.

The code initializes the variable `suma` to 0. This does not affect the values of `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, or `numbers`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `suma` is explicitly set to 0.
