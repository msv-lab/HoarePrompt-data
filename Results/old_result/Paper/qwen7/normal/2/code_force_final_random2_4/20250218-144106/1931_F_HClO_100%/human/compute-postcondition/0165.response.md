Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` must have at least one tuple.
- `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`.
- `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'`. There is no reference to `a3` or `l3` in this particular print statement. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **no**
