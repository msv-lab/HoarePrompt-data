The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `w` representing the number of test cases, followed by `w` sets of inputs. Each set includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths. It then calculates and prints the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times in the input list for each test case.
