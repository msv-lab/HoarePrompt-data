Output State: `b` is an empty list, `p` is the product of all elements in the original list `b`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, starting from the last element.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `b` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The variable `p` will hold the product of all elements in the original list `b`. The list `ans` will contain the cumulative product of all elements in `b`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first, with each iteration's product being appended to `ans`.
