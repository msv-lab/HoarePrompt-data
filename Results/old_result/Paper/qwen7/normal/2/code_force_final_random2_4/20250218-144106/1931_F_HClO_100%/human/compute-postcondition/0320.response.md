Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `a3` is a list of integers.
   - `l3` is a list of lists of integers.
   - `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple `(a3, l3)`.
   - `_` is 0 or 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `a3` and `l3`.

4. **Post-Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension of `i` for `i` in `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`.

5. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop continues based on the condition involving `l3`, we need to ensure that `l3` does not match the list comprehension mentioned.
   - For the loop to continue, `l3` must not be equal to the list comprehension of `i` for `i` in `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`.

Given this analysis, the only variables that can be adjusted are `a3` and `l3`. However, since the loop continues based on the condition involving `l3`, `l3` must not match the specified list comprehension.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `l3` does not match the list comprehension of `i` for `i` in `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`.

**State:**
**`m` is greater than 0, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers that does not match the list comprehension of `i` for `i` in `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple (a3, l3), and `_` is 0 or 1.**
