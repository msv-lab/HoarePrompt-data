Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the new variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the inputs.
