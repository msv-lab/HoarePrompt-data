Postcondition: `i` is between 0 and `m-3`, `m` must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr[i]` is either unchanged or adjusted such that if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to `False`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
