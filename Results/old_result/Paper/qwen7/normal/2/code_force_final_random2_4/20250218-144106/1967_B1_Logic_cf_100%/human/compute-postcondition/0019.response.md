Output State: **`b` is 2, `n` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 2, `m` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 2, `ans` is `ans + (n + 2) // (2 * 2)`**

Explanation: The value of `b` remains 2. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, but the condition that `min(n, m)` is at least 2 is still valid. The variable `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value, which simplifies to `(n + 2) // 4`.
