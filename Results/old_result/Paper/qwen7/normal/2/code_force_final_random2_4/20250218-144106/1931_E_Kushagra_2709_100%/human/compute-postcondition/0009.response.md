Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `tot` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `num`, `i`, or `tot`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was in. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
