Output State: **`combined` is fully processed, `heap` is an empty list, `current_profit` reflects the final profit, `max_profit` holds the highest profit, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `remaining_items = []` initializes an empty list for `remaining_items`. This does not affect the values of `combined`, `heap`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, or `test_cases`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
