Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is either 1 or `m`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is adjusted based on the condition `y1 <= y2`, `a` is `m - y1` if `y2` is less than `y1`, otherwise `a` is `y1 - 1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `c` is `m - y2` if `y2` is less than `y1`, otherwise `c` is `r[5] - m`, and the following conditions are true: 

- `b // 2 \leq a`
- `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`
- `y1 > m` or `y1 <= 0`
- `x1 > n` or `x1 < 1`.
