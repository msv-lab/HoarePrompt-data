Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `case` is an input string.
   - `op` is incremented multiple times but its exact value is not relevant to the print statement.
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and filtering out non-digit characters.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`.
   - `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`.
   - `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`.
   - `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median`.
   - `i` is `k + 1`.
   - `op` is 0.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is simply `print(1)`.

Given the initial state, the print statement `print(1)` will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
