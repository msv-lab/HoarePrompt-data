Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even, and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function `func_2` indirectly accepts parameters through test cases, where for each test case, it receives integers `n` and `k` and performs some operation based on the given constraints, though the exact operation is not specified in the provided information.
