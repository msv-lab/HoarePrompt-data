You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism. After all iterations of the loop, `s2` will be determined based on the following rules:
    #- If the length of `s` is 1, `s2` remains `s`.
    #- If `s` consists of all the same characters and has a length greater than 1, `s2` is the string `s` rotated by one character to the left.
    #- Otherwise, `s2` is a random permutation of the string `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Handling Single Character Strings:**
   - If the string `s` consists of only one character, the program prints "No". This is correct because there are no other characters to rearrange into a different string.

3. **Handling Strings with All Characters the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string `s` are the same and the string length is greater than 1, the program also prints "No". This is correct because any rearrangement of such a string would result in the same string.

4. **Generating a Different String:**
   - For strings that do not fall into the above two categories, the program generates a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of `s`.
   - It then checks if the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`. If they are the same, it tries to generate another string by rotating the first character to the end.
   - Finally, it prints "Yes" followed by the generated string `s2`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Random Shuffling:**
   - The use of `random.sample(s, len(s))` is generally correct for generating a different permutation of the string. However, the shuffle operation itself does not guarantee that the resulting string will be different from the original in all cases. There's a small chance that the shuffle might result in the same string due to the nature of random sampling.

2. **Rotation Check:**
   - The rotation check (`if s == s2:`) is unnecessary and redundant. If `s2` is a valid permutation, it should already be different from `s`. The rotation check is an additional safeguard but is not strictly necessary.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs "Yes" and "No" in a case-insensitive manner, which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

While the program logic is mostly correct, the use of `random.sample` does not guarantee that the generated string will always be different from the original in all cases. However, given the constraints (strings of length up to 10), the probability of generating the same string is very low.

Given this, we can conclude that the program is generally correct and will work as intended for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
