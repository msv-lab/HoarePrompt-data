Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and their lengths into a list (`arr`).
3. The function `func_1` is called with the list of stick lengths.
4. In `func_1`, a dictionary `freq` is used to count the frequency of each stick length.
5. The program then calculates the total number of regular polygons that can be formed by summing up the integer division of each frequency by 4 (since each polygon needs 4 equal sides).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented:
- The program correctly counts the frequency of each stick length.
- It correctly calculates the number of complete polygons (each needing 4 sides) that can be formed from these frequencies.
- The program handles all given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) appropriately.

Therefore, the program logic matches the problem requirements and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
