Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an input integer, and \(n \neq 4\).

The print statement is:
```python
print('No esta en el rango')
```

This print statement outputs a specific string, regardless of the values of `casos`, `t`, and `n`. The string does not depend on any of these variables and is hardcoded within the print statement.

Output: **No esta en el rango**
