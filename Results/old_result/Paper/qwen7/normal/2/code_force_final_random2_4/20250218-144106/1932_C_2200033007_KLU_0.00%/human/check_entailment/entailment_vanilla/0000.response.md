Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the logic of processing the commands and calculating the required remainders.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not perform the actual calculation of the remainders of the products of the array elements as specified in the problem statement.
   - Instead, it simply appends the elements of the array `a` to the list `b` based on the direction of the command ('L' or 'R') and then reverses this list before returning it.

3. **Product Calculation and Remainder:**
   - The problem requires calculating the remainder of the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` after each command.
   - The function `func_1` does not compute these remainders; it only processes the commands to decide which elements to append to the list `b`.
   - After appending the elements, it calculates the product in reverse order but does not use the actual remainders of the products as required.

4. **Reversal and Output:**
   - The function `func_1` returns the reversed list `ans`, which is not what the problem requires.
   - The problem requires the remainders of the products at each step, not the elements themselves.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. It processes the commands to decide which elements to append to the list `b` but does not calculate the required remainders of the products of the array elements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
