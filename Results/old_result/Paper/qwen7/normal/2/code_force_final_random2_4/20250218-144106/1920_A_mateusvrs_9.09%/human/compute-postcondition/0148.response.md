Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(n)`. The only variables involved here are `n` and the loop counter (which is `_` but does not affect the state).

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an input integer.

4. **Effect of the loop on the state**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, each iteration modifies `bx`, `ax`, or `cx` depending on the value of `a`.

5. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0, we need to ensure `n` is still greater than 0 for the next iteration.
   - The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged within the loop unless explicitly modified by the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, these values stay the same.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it remains greater than 0 for the next iteration.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**
