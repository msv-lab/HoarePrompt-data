Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `l + 1` or `r`, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is equal to `sunks + 2` or `sunks + 3` or remains 0, 1, or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, the value of `a[r]` is less than the value of `a[l]`.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If `a[r] * 2 == k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 3. Otherwise, if `a[r] * 2 != k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 2. In both cases, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and the relationship between `a[r]` and `a[l]` remain as specified in the precondition, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
