Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not, `m` is either 0 or a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 2, `m` is not equal to 1, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\) for all `i` in the range from 3 to `m`. If `m` is 0, then `i` remains equal to `k`; otherwise, `i` is equal to `k + 2`.**

This output state reflects that `t` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial conditions.
