Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the constraints on daily purchases and the price increases.
2. The provided solution attempts to solve this by sorting the list of ticket prices and then iterating through the sorted list to calculate the minimum cost.
3. However, the logic used to update the cumulative cost `c` seems flawed. Specifically, the formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.
4. The formula should account for the total cost of purchasing `s` tickets on day `i`, which is `l[i] * s`. Additionally, the price increase for subsequent days needs to be considered properly.
5. The current implementation does not handle the price increases correctly after purchasing tickets on a given day. It also incorrectly calculates the cost using a quadratic term (`- s * s / 2`), which is not relevant to the problem.
6. The solution does not properly simulate the price increases for subsequent days when tickets are purchased.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
