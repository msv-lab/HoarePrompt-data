Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'`.

2. **Analyze the initial state**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0'.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1.
   - `cost` is 8.
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1.
   - If `s[right]` and `s[left]` are both '0' and '1', respectively, they have swapped their values.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'`.
   - Initially, `right` is set to `len(s) - 1`, which means `s[right]` is the last character in the list `s`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `s[right]` must not be '0'. If `s[right]` is '0', the loop will not execute at all because the second condition `s[right] != '0'` will fail.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `s[right]` is not '0' for the loop to execute the first time. Since `sChar` ends with '0', the last character in `s` (which is `s[right]`) cannot be '0' unless there was a swap that changed it. However, since no swap is mentioned in the initial conditions, we assume `s[right]` is the last character of `sChar` and is '0'.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `s[right]` is not '0' for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 8, `right` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, and `s[right]` must not be '0'**.
