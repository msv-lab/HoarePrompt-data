Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer, `h` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split by ':'.**

The code splits the input string by the colon (`:`) and assigns the first part to `h` and the second part to `m`. Since the initial state of `h` and `m` was dependent on user input, these values are now explicitly defined by the input. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
