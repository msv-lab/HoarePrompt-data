Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string; `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer; `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing one element, which is `(1 << i) - 1`; `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans.append((1 << i) - 1)` appends the value of `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, `(1 << i) - 1` will be either `0` (when `i` is 0) or `1` (when `i` is 1). Therefore, `ans` will contain one element, which is either `0` or `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
