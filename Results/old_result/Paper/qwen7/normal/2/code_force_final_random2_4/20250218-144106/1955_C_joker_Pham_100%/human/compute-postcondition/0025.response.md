Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is now n - 2, `sunks` is equal to `sunks + 2`, and the value of `a[r]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. Since `sunks` was initially equal to `sunks + 1`, after executing this line, `sunks` will be equal to `sunks + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
