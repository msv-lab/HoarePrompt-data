Output State: **`ans` is False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` and the current value of `arr[i]` converted to integers.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. None of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `arr`, or `nums`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
