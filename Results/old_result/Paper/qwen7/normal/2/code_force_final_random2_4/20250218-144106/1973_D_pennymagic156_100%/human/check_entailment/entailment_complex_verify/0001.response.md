### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the given Python program and proposed a corrected version. Let's break down the reasoning to validate the correctness of the original assessment and the provided solution.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Program:

1. **Querying for `v`:**
   - The original program assumes that the maximum value of `a_i` is `n` and queries for `i * n` values. This assumption is incorrect because the actual maximum value could be less than `n`.
   - The program should query for the maximum value directly and use this value to determine `v`.

2. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The splitting logic incorrectly assumes that the maximum value is `n` and queries for `i * v` where `v` is the maximum value. This approach might not work if the maximum value is less than `n`.
   - The program should correctly determine the maximum value and use it to check for valid splits.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array is not divisible into `k` subarrays with the required properties.

#### Corrected Program Analysis:

The corrected program addresses these issues by:
1. Determining the maximum value in the array.
2. Using this maximum value to query for the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * max_value` for decreasing values of `i` starting from `k`.

Let's analyze the corrected program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `n` and `k` using `func_1()`.
   - It determines the maximum value in the array by querying for `i * n` values and finding the maximum value.

2. **Determine Maximum Value:**
   - The program iterates from `1` to `n` and queries for `i * n`. If it finds a value `n`, it sets `max_val` to `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If no such value is found, `max_val` remains `1`, indicating that no valid split exists.

3. **Check for Valid Split:**
   - If `max_val` is `1`, the program prints `-1` because no valid split exists.
   - Otherwise, it uses `max_val` to determine `v` and checks for valid splits by querying for `i * v`.

4. **Print Final Answer:**
   - If a valid split is found, it prints the value `v`.
   - If no valid split is found, it prints `-1`.

This corrected program correctly handles the problem constraints and ensures that the maximum value is determined accurately. It also checks for valid splits using the correct logic.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the analysis, the original assessment correctly identified the issues in the original program and proposed a corrected version that addresses these issues. The corrected program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

**Final: True**
