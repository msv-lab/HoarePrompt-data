Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- The variable `n` is mentioned to be greater than 1 but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.
- The variable `a[0]` is greater than the current value of `a[1]`, but the exact values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` are not needed since the print statement does not reference them.
- The variable `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`. Since `a[0] > a[1]`, the list `new` will start with `a[1]` and continue with the rest of the elements in `a`.
- The variable `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new[i-1]` is greater than `new[i]` for at least one `i` in the range 1 to the length of `new`. However, this value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`, so the output is **NO**.
