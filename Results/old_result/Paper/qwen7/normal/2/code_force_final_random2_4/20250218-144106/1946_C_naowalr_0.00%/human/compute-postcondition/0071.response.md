Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `R` is 100001, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from user input, `b` is an integer from user input, for every node `i` (where `1 ≤ i ≤ n`), `adj[i]` contains a list of all nodes directly connected to node `i`, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 1, `x` is 50001**.

Explanation: The value of `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, which is `(1 + 100001) // 2`, resulting in `50001`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
