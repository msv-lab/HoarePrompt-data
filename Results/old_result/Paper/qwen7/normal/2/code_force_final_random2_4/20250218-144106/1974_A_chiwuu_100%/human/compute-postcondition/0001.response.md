Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `t` is not used in the loop itself, its value does not directly affect the loop's execution. However, it is mentioned as part of the initial state.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `t` does not need to be adjusted since it is not involved in the loop's execution.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
