Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. The logic in the program is flawed and does not accurately account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

Let's break down why the program is incorrect:

1. **Calculation of Space for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates `t` as `b` (number of 2x2 icons), but then it incorrectly adjusts `t` based on whether `b` is even or odd. This step is unnecessary and incorrect.

2. **Space Calculation for Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program then calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which seems to be an attempt to calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not properly account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

3. **Final Calculation of Screens Needed:**
   - The final part of the program attempts to calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, but it does so in a way that does not correctly reflect the available space on the screens.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the total space required for all 2x2 icons.
2. Determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space on the screens.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate space required for 2x2 icons
        space_for_2x2 = b * 4
        # Calculate remaining space for 1x1 icons
        remaining_space = (5 * 3 * 15) - space_for_2x2
        # Calculate number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
        screens_needed = (a + remaining_space - 1) // remaining_space
        print(screens_needed)

func()
```

This corrected program should correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons.
