Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program `func_1` does not account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends. Instead, it assumes that each pair will be chosen with equal probability, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of choosing each pair of friends. For each pair of friends `(a, b)` with friendship value `f`, the expected value contribution to the sum is `f * (probability of choosing this pair in k trials)`. The probability of choosing a specific pair in one trial is `1 / C(n, 2)`, where `C(n, 2)` is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import comb

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = comb(n, 2)
    result = 0
    for (a, b, f) in friendships:
        prob = 1 / total_pairs
        expected_value = f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) * prob
        result += expected_value
    return int(result % MOD)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected version calculates the expected value correctly by considering the probability of choosing each pair of friends.
