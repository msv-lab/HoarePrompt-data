### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**: The function summary states that the function `func_1` calculates and returns a cost value of 16. However, the function itself does not match this claim. Instead, it attempts to swap characters based on certain conditions, which is not the correct approach for solving the problem.

3. **Current Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string and tries to swap characters based on the condition `if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1'`.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not account for the cyclic nature of the shifts and does not guarantee the minimum cost.
   - The logic for finding the next '0' and '1' positions and swapping them is also incorrect because it does not consider the optimal way to minimize the total cost.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculate the cost of making the rest of the string sorted through cyclic shifts.
   - We should count the number of '1's and '0's in the string and determine the minimum cost by considering the positions of these characters.

5. **Evaluation of the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the current implementation does not handle all cases correctly and does not account for the cyclic nature of the shifts.
   - The function summary provided is incorrect and does not reflect the actual behavior of the function.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The current implementation does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
