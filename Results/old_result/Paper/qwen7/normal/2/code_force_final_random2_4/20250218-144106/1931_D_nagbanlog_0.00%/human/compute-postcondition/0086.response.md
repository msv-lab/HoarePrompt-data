Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The code updates `required_mod_x` to be `(x - mod_x) % x`. This does not affect `freq[mod_x, mod_y]`, `beautiful_count`, `mod_y`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, or their relationships. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with only the calculation for `required_mod_x` being updated.
