Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 1440) and a string `s` (in the format "hh:mm") representing a valid time. It returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.**

However, since the function definition itself does not appear in the provided code snippet, we can only infer the parameters from the description. The function likely accepts an integer `t` and a string `s` as inputs and returns a value based on certain conditions related to the time represented by `s` and the integer `t`.
