State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `_` is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used as a placeholder and typically does not affect the loop's execution directly. However, for the loop to start, the condition `range(t)` must be valid, meaning `t` must be an integer within the specified range (1 to 500).
- The variable `r` is a list, and since the loop body is omitted, its state remains unchanged.
- The underscore `_` is used to iterate `t` times, starting from 0 up to `t-1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `_` is 0, but for the loop to start executing, it should be set to 1.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are to ensure `t` is within the required range and to set `_` to 1 to start the loop iteration.
