Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value is not relevant to the print statement.
   - `ap` is an input integer. Its value is not specified but it will be used in the calculation of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   - `k` must be between 0 and `ap`-1 (inclusive). This value is also not relevant to the print statement.
   - `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. We need to determine the values of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` to understand this update.

2. **Calculations**:
   - `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer.
   - `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` <= 0 else the ceiling value of `x` divided by 15.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement outputs `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.

Given these steps, let's analyze the values of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`:

- `bxsfory` depends on `y`. Without knowing the exact value of `y`, we cannot determine `bxsfory` precisely, but we know it is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- `bxsfory1` depends on `x`. If `x` is positive, `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of `x / 15`. If `x` is zero or negative, `bxsfory1` is 0.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only express the result in terms of these values.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **ceiling(y / 2) + ceiling(x / 15) if x > 0, otherwise ceiling(y / 2)**
