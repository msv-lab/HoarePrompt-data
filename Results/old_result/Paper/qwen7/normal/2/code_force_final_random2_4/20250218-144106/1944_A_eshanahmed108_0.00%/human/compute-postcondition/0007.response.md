Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
