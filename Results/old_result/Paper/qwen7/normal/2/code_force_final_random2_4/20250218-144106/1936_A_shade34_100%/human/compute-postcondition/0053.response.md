Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pans` is a list containing either the integer 0 or the integers 0 and 1. If `s` equals '<', `pans` will contain the integer 1.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or affect the conditions of the variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously printed output is displayed immediately. Since no variables are modified or their values changed by this command, the initial state remains unchanged.
