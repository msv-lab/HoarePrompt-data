Output State: **`a[i] + k // (i + 1)` is calculated and stored in `r`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` and stores it in the variable `r`. The variable `i` is updated to `i + 1` as per the initial state. The variable `n` remains unchanged.
