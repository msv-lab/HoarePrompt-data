Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `s2` is a random permutation of the input string `s`. The condition `s != s2` is checked for each iteration, and if `s` is different from `s2`, 'Yes' is printed along with `s2`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, 'No' is printed. This process is repeated for all the inputs provided by the user, and for each input, `s2` will always be a random permutation of the corresponding `s`.
