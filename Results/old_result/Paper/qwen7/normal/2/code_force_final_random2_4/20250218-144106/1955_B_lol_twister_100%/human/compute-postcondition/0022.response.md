Output State: **`li` is a list with one element which is `a + k * c + d * 0`, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given that `h` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a + k * c`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
