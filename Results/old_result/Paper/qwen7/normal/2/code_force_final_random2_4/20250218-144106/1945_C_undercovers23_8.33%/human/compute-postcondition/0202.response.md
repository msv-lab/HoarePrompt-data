Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or not, `zero_perc` is 33, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is 33, `lst` contains the value 3**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` equals 3. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `lst` now contains the value 3.
