Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(t)` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `t` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such operation is mentioned, `t` stays as the input integer.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `t` remains the same as the input integer.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no' appended, and either 'no' or 'yes' appended, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user.**
