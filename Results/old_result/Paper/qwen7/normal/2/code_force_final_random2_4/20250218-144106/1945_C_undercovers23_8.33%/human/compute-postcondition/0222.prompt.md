Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `zero` is the total count of '0' in the string `s`, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is the total count of '1' in the string `s`, `one_perc` is 100, `lst` contains all indices `i+1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached `n-1`, indicating that every index in the string `s` has been processed. The counts of '0' (`zero`) and '1' (`one`) will reflect the total occurrences of these characters in the string. Both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` will be 100 because the entire string has been considered, making the percentages of '0' and '1' 100%. The list `lst` will contain all indices `i+1` where the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` were met during the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the first element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the third element in `lst`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
