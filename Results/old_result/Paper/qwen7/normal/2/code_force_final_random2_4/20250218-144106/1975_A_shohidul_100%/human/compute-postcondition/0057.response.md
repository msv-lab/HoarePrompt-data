Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` is greater than the current value of `a[1]`, and `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` that starts from index `i` (which is 1) to the end of the list `a`. The conditions that `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `a[i-1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]` remain valid. Since `i` is 1, `a[i-1]` refers to `a[0]` and `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`, so `a[0]` is greater than the current value of `a[1]`.
