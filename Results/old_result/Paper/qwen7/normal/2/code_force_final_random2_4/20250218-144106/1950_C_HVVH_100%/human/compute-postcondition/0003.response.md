Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

The code splits the input into two integers, `h` and `m`, which are the hours and minutes respectively. However, the values of `t`, `day`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
