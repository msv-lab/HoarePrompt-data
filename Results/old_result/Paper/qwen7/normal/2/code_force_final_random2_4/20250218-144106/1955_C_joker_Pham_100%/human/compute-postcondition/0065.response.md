Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` is now `r - 1` or remains n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is equal to `sunks + 1` or `sunks + 2` or `sunks + 3` or remains 0, 1, or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, the value of `a[r]` is less than the value of `a[l]` if the condition `a[r] < a[l]` is true, otherwise `r` remains unchanged and `sunks` changes accordingly.**
