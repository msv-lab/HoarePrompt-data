Output State: **`s` is a new string input by the user, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or unchanged, `b` is either 'SQUARE' or unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**.

This means that the variable `s` has been updated to a new string input by the user, while `a`, `b`, `j`, and `n` retain their previous states.
