Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `a3` is an integer read from input, `l3` is a list of integers read from input, and `l3` has `a2` inserted at index `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The code inserts `a2` into the list `l3` at the index `idx1`, which is `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
