Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `r()` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `r()` is called, but since no specific action or return value is defined for `r()`, the only changes are that `t` remains greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, and the call to `r()` is noted.
