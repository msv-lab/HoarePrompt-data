Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is `c + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `c` by adding the value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression simplifies to `c += l[1] * s - s * s / 2`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
