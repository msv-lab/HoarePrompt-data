Output State: `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is an integer from user input; `b` is an integer from user input; for every node `i` (where `1 ≤ i ≤ n`), `adj[i]` contains a list of all nodes directly connected to node `i`; `i` is `n - 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the adjacency list `adj` will contain all the edges provided by the user input, forming a graph where each node points to all nodes it is connected to. The variable `i` will be set to `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its `n-1` iterations.
