Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` is updated by appending `l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `l[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` was previously `n-1`, after executing `i = i - 1` (implied by `ans1.append(l[i])`), `i` becomes `n-2`. The value of `k` remains unchanged at -2. All other variables from the initial state remain unaffected.
