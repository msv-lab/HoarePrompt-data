Based on the initial state and the conditions provided, let's break down the variables and their potential values:

1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1440.
2. `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
3. `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
4. `h` is an integer between 1 and 12.
5. `m` is an integer, but its value is not specified, so we cannot determine it precisely without more information.

Given the conditions for `h` and `day`:
- If `h` is 0, then `day` is set to 'AM' and `h` is set to 12.
- If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
- Otherwise, `day` remains as 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.

Since `h` is explicitly stated to be between 1 and 12, the only relevant condition is the third one: `day` remains as 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the print statement will output the formatted string with `h` and `m` formatted to two digits, followed by the value of `day`.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} AM**
