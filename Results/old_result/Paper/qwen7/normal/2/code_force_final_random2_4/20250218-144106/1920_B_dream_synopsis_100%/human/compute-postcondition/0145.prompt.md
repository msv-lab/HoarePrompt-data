Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); for each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq k, x \leq n\); and a list of n integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\) for all \(i\). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will execute exactly `k + 1` times. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, and `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements, each being the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.

To summarize, `i` will be `k`, `k` will still be a non-negative integer, `sums` will be the final calculated value after the last iteration of the loop, and `ans` will be a list with `k + 1` elements, where each element represents the value of `sums` after each iteration from 0 to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The list `a` remains as a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` is calculated based on the conditions within the loop:

- If `i == 0`, the first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For subsequent iterations where `i + x - 1 < n`, each element in `ans` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- For iterations where `i + x - 1 >= n`, each element in `ans` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

In summary, `ans` will contain the sequence of sums calculated according to the given conditions over all iterations of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop will execute `k + 1` times. After all iterations, `i` will be `k`, `k` remains unchanged (as it's not modified within the loop), and `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. The value of `sums` changes based on the conditions inside the loop: it either adds `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n` or just `a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`. Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and goes up to `k`, `ans` will contain the sequence of `sums` values calculated over these iterations.

In more detail, `ans` will contain the following sequence of values:
- Initially, `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For each subsequent iteration, `sums` is updated according to the conditions provided in the loop body.
- The final state of `ans` will be a list containing `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
