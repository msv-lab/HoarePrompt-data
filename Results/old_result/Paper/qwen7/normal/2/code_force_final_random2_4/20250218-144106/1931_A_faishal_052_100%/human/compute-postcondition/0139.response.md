Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the current state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `j` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 2. Since `j` is currently 1, it satisfies the condition `j < 2`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: After incrementing `j` to 2, we check the condition `j < 2`. Since `2` is not less than `2`, the loop will terminate.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would actually be the final iteration in this case) is:

State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26`, and `arr` contains the element 26**
