Output State: **`k` is equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the value of `k`, which was initially set to 0. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no other variables are affected, `k` remains unchanged.
