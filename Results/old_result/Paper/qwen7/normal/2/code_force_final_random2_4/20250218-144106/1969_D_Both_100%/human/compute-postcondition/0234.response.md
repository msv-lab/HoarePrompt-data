Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `combined` will be an empty list, `k` will be less than or equal to 0, and `heap` will contain the last item from `combined` after all items have been processed. `current_profit` will reflect the final profit calculated after all conditions in the loop were considered, and `max_profit` will hold the highest profit achieved during the entire loop execution. The `remaining_items` list will remain empty, `neg_prices` will be a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` will be the return value of `func_2()`, and `bonuses` will be a list returned by `func_2()`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- `combined` is empty because all items have been processed.
- `k` is non-positive (less than or equal to 0) because it is decremented with each iteration and starts at a positive value.
- `heap` contains the last item from `combined` after all processing.
- `current_profit` is the final profit calculated after all operations within the loop.
- `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved during the loop's execution.
- `remaining_items` is empty as it was initially.
- `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- `heap` is updated after each iteration with push and pop operations.
