Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided, while the conditions for `t` remain the same. The variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this line of code, so their initial states (not specified here but implied to be consistent with the given constraints) remain unchanged.
