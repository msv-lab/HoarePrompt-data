Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and two binary strings \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \). For each test case, it finds a substring in \( a_1 \) that matches a prefix in \( a_2 \) and returns the length of the longest matching prefix. If no match is found, it returns 1. The function prints the matched substring and the length of the longest matching prefix.**
