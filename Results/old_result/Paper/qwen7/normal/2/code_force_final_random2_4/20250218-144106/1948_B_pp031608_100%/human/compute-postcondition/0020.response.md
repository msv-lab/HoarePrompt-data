Output State: **`ans` is False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`**.

The code simply reassigns `ans` to `False`, which does not affect the values of `m`, `i`, `arr`, or `nums`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for `ans` being explicitly set to `False`.
