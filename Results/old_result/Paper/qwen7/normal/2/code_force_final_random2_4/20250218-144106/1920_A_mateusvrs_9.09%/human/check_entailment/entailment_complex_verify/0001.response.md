### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function initializes `t` with the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of constraints.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store values of `x` where `a = 3` (i.e., `k` must not be equal to `x`).
   - Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to handle the bounds of `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If `a = 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If `a = 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If `a = 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

3. **Validation and Calculation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there are no valid `k` values, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of elements in `cx` within the range `[bx+1, ax-1]` from the total possible values `(ax - bx - 1)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:

- **Bounds Calculation**:
  - The code correctly updates `ax` and `bx` to represent the valid range of `k` values.
  - However, there is a critical issue in the calculation of the number of valid `k` values. Specifically, the code uses `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to calculate the number of valid `k` values, but it should be `ax - bx + 1 - tmp - 1` because the range `[bx, ax]` should exclude both `bx` and `ax` themselves.

- **Set Handling**:
  - The set `cx` is used to store values that `k` must not be equal to. This part is handled correctly.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code correctly handles the case where `bx >= ax` by appending `0` to the result list `r`.
  - However, the calculation of the number of valid `k` values is incorrect due to the off-by-one error mentioned above.

### Corrected Calculation:
The correct calculation should be:
```python
r.append(ax - bx - tmp)
```
instead of:
```python
r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was inaccurate because the calculation of the number of valid `k` values is incorrect due to an off-by-one error. The correct calculation should exclude both `bx` and `ax` themselves from the range.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**
