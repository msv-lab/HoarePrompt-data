Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. The function returns different values based on the conditions provided for `n` and `m` within each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing three integers: `t`, `n`, and `m`. For each test case, it checks the values of `n` and `m` and returns a specific value based on those conditions.
