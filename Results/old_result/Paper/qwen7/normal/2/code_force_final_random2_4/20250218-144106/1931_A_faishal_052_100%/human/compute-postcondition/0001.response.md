Output State: **`cases` is an input integer and 1 <= t <= 100; `info` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `info`. The value of `cases` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about the `info` list and retains the initial state of `cases`.
