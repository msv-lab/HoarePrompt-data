Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is -2, and `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` appended with `b[i]`, which is `b[1]`.**

The value of `k` is decremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to -2. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `ans1`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
