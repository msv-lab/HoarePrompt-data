Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in palka:`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `palka`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on the value of each element in the list `palka` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `palka`: This is the list that contains the elements to be iterated over.

3. **Check the initial state of `palka`**:
   - `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - For the loop to execute, `palka` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each element in `palka`, `palka` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`shapes`, `j`, `w`, `ln`, `pl`, `d`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `palka` must have at least one element.

**State:**
**`palka` must have at least one element**
