Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, `w` is the square root of `q`, the list `M` contains the element `w`, and either `w` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, or there is no else part in the code.
Code of the loop:
while i < w:
    if q % i == 0:
        if i >= x - 1:
            M += [i]
        if q // i >= x - 1:
            M += [q // i]
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, the list `M` contains the elements `w` and `i`, and if `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `i` remains the same and `M` contains `i`. If `q` is not divisible by `i`, the conditions remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is increased by 1, `i` must be less than `w` and greater than 2, M remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is either equal to 5 or less than `w`; if `i` equals 5, `M` is a list containing the value 5; otherwise, the condition `q // i >= x - 1` determines the contents of `M`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
