Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and the value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the value of `a[r]` minus `a[l]`. The current value of `a[r]` is 0.**
