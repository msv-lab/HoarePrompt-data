Output State: **`el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`**.

This means that the value of `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
