Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is at least 0, `max_profit` is 0, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the return value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of the function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` to the variable `profit_mid`. The values of `low`, `high`, `max_profit`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states. The exact value of `profit_mid` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but it is known that `profit_mid` now holds this value.
