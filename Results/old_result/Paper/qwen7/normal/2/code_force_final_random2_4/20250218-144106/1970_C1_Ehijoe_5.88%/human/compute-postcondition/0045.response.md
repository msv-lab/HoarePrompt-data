Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` and `v` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers. If `u` is equal to the last element of the list `tree`, then `i` remains 1 and `n` remains greater than or equal to 2. If `u` is not equal to the last element of the list `tree`, then no change occurs to `i` and `n`.
