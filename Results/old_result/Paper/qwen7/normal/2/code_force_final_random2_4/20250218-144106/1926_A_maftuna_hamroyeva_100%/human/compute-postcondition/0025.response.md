Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the last character in the string `a`, the variable `l` represents the total count of 'A' characters in `a`, and `h` represents the total count of non-'A' characters in `a`. The number of 'A' characters (`l`) is less than or equal to the number of non-'A' characters (`h`).**
