### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Program Analysis:
The given program has several issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Checking**: The program attempts to check if the array can be sorted by splitting elements, but it does not correctly handle the splitting process and the subsequent checks.
2. **Incomplete Handling of Splitting**: The program does not fully implement the logic to split elements and check if the resulting array is sorted. It only checks if the split array is sorted but does not update the original array correctly.
3. **No Iterative Splitting Process**: The program does not iteratively attempt to split elements until the array is sorted. Instead, it performs a single check and stops if the condition fails.

#### Corrected Version:
The original assessment provides a corrected version of the function, which addresses these issues:
1. **Function `can_sort`**: Checks if the array is already sorted.
2. **Function `split_and_check`**: Attempts to split elements and checks if the resulting array is sorted.
3. **Iterative Process**: Continuously splits and checks until the array is sorted or determines that it cannot be sorted.

The corrected version ensures that the array is processed correctly and handles the splitting and checking logic appropriately.

#### Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. The corrected version provided in the assessment addresses these issues and ensures the program works as intended.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect according to the problem description and the provided function summary. The corrected version provided in the assessment should be used instead.
