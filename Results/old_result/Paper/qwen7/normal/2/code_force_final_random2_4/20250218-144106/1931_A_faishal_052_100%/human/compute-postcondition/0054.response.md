Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `lex` is either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive), `info` is a list containing [26, 26, 26], `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `k < cases**.

The code `arr = []` assigns an empty list to `arr`. The values of `lex`, `info`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
