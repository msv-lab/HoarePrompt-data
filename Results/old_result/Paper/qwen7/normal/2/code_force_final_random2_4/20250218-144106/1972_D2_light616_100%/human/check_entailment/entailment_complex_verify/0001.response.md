### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and behavior of the provided Python program. Let's break down the key points to validate the assessment:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it checks whether \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). This is done by checking if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is divisible by \(a + b\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Testing the Logic:

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\): No pairs \((a, b)\) exist, so the output should be 0.
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\): The only pair \((1, 1)\) satisfies the condition, so the output should be 1.
   - For \(n = 3\) and \(m = 5\): The pair \((1, 1)\) satisfies the condition, so the output should be 1.
   - For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\): The pairs \((2, 2)\), \((3, 6)\), \((4, 4)\), \((6, 3)\), \((6, 6)\), and \((8, 8)\) satisfy the condition, so the output should be 6.

2. **General Case**:
   - The logic correctly checks for pairs \((a, b)\) where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) and ensures that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The use of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` ensures that the count does not exceed the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

### Detailed Validation with Annotations:

- **Annotation Explanation**:
  - The annotation states that the function `func_1` correctly iterates over possible pairs \((x, y)\) and counts valid pairs based on the given conditions.
  - The annotation also correctly explains the behavior of the inner and outer loops and the conditions under which the count is incremented.

- **Test Cases**:
  - The provided test cases match the expected outputs, validating the correctness of the implementation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the logic and behavior of the provided Python program. The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described in the problem statement.

**Final: True**
