### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. You and the computer take turns placing rooks, with the computer mirroring your moves unless the move is along the diagonal. We need to calculate the number of different final configurations after \( k \) moves, considering the constraints and the modulo operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each move reduces the number of available positions for future moves.
   - Moves on the diagonal reduce the number of unique positions by 1, while off-diagonal moves reduce by 2.
   - The number of remaining positions after \( k \) moves is \( n - \text{num} \), where `num` is the count of moves on the diagonal plus twice the count of off-diagonal moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The code uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations for the remaining positions.
   - The base cases are handled correctly:
     - If \( m = 0 \), there are no positions left, so the number of configurations is 0.
     - If \( m = 1 \), there is only one position left, so the number of configurations is 1.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the recurrence relation is used to compute the number of configurations, considering the previous states.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The results are taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers, which is correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases correctly by initializing the DP array and setting the base cases appropriately.

6. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read and processed correctly, with the number of test cases and individual test cases being handled in a loop.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to compute the number of different final configurations based on the given constraints and examples. The dynamic programming approach and modulo operation are implemented accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
