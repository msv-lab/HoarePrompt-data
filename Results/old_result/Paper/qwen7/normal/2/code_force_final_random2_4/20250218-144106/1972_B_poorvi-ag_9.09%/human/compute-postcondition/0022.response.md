Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is a list containing 'no', `i` is 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user**.

Explanation: The code `results.append('no')` appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. The length of the list `results` increases by one, so `i` (which was initially 1) is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
