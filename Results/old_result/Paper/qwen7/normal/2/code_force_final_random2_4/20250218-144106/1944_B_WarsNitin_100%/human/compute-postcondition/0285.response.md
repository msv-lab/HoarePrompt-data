Output State: **`i` is within the range [1, n - 2], `k` equals 0, and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`; `l` contains the element `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i]` to the list `l`. Since `i` was already within the specified range and other conditions about `b[i]` were met, these conditions remain valid. The only new information is that `l` now includes the element `b[i]`.
