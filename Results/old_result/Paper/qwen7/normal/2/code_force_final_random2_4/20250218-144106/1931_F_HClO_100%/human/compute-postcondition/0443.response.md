Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, `m` equals 2, and `idx1` is not less than `idx2` with `idx1` being less than or equal to `idx2.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
