Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `s * (l[0] + n - 1)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - (n-1) * s`, `c` is the sum of `c + s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k - n * s`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` has reached the end of the range defined by `range(n)`, which means `i` is now equal to `n`. The variable `t` accumulates the sum of `s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for each iteration, where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `s` remains the minimum value between `m` and the remaining value of `k` after all subtractions. The variable `c` holds the cumulative sum of the expression `s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all iterations, and `k` is reduced by `n * s` over the course of the loop.
