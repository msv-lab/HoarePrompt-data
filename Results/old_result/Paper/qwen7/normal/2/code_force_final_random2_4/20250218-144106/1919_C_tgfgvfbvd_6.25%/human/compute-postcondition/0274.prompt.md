Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = l[0]
    b = 0
    c = 0
    y = 0
    for y in range(1, n):
        if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
            b = l[y]
            break
    for x in range(y + 1, n):
        if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
            if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
            c += 1
        elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
            if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        elif a >= l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than 3, y is equal to n-1, x is equal to n, c is a non-negative integer, a is the maximum value among l[1] to l[n-1] that satisfies l[y] > l[y-1], and b is the second maximum value among l[1] to l[n-1] that satisfies l[y] > l[y-1]. If no such values exist, then b remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `y` will be `n - 1`, `x` will be `n + 1`, and `b` will be set to the first element in list `l` that is greater than `b` and also greater than `a`. If no such element exists, `b` will retain its last assigned value. The variable `c` will be incremented each time an element in `l` is found that is greater than both `a` and `b`. If no such element is found, `c` will retain its last assigned value. The variables `n`, `a`, and `l` will remain in their final states from the initial or intermediate iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes:
- `y` will be `n - 1`.
- `x` will be `n + 1`.
- `b` will be the smallest element in `l` that is greater than both `a` and `b`, or it will remain unchanged if no such element exists.
- `c` will be the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`, or it will remain unchanged if no such elements are found.
- `a` and `l` will retain their final values from the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: y is n-1, x is n, n is greater than 1, a is the minimum value among l[0] to l[n-2], b is the maximum value among l[0] to l[n-2], c is the count of elements in l[0] to l[n-2] that are neither equal to a nor b but satisfy certain conditions, and c is also the count of times the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` is met during the loop execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
