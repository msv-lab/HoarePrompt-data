Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`.
- `ele` is the first element in `lst`.

### Loop Head:
```
for ele in lst:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable (`ele`)**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ele` was the first element in `lst`.
2. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `lst` must be considered. This means `ele` will be set to the second element in `lst`.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`mini`**: The value of `mini` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop variable `ele` in the loop head.
- **`ele`**: It needs to be set to the second element in `lst`.

### New State:
- `mini` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `ele` is now the second element in `lst`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`**.
