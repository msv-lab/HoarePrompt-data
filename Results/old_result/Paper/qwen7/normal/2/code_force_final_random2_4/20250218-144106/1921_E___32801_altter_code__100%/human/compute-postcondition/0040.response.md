Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1 or r[2] + a, `y1` is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1, `x2` is r[4] - a, `y2` is 1, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and (x2 - x1) is odd, `y1` is decreased by `a`, `c` is `y1 - 1`.**

This means that the value of `c` is now `y1 - 1`, while all other variables retain their original conditions and values from the initial state.
