Output State: **`sm` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `a`, and `cts` will be a list containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays ending at each index from 0 to len(`a`) - 1; `cts` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `cts.sort()` sorts the list `cts`. The sorting operation does not change the values of `sm` or the elements of `cts` other than arranging them in ascending order. Therefore, `sm` still holds the sum of all elements in the list `a`, and `cts` contains all possible cumulative sums of subarrays ending at each index from 0 to len(`a`) - 1, but now it is sorted.
