Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be at least 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and depending on the value of `x`, either:
- `big` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x == 1`.
- `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x == 2`.
- `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x != 2`.
