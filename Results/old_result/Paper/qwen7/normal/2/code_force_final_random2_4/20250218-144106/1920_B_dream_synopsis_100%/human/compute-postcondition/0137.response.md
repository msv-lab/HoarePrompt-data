Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `sums` is `sums + a[1]`, `ans` contains `[sums + a[1]]**'

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is currently `sums + a[1]`, the updated `ans` list now contains the value `[sums + a[1]]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
