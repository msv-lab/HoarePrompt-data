Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `t` is increased by `s`.**

Explanation: The code `t += s` increments the value of `t` by `s`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `s` is the minimum between `m` and `k`, which is preserved. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `t` by `s`.
