Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is greater than 1 but its exact value is not specified.
- `mak2` is equal to `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` will be a positive integer.
- `pans` is a list containing only one element, which is 1.
- `s` is the string input by the user, but it is mentioned that `s` is either '<' or '='. This value is not needed for the print statement execution.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Here's the breakdown of what will be printed:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information. However, since the print statement does not include `mak`, it is not part of the output.
- `mak2` is `n-1`, where `n` is greater than 1, so `mak2` is a positive integer.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `mak2` is again `n-1`, where `n` is greater than 1, so `mak2` is a positive integer.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 2 [mak2] 2 [mak2]** (where [mak2] is the value of `n-1` and is a positive integer).
