Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `k` is -1, `ans2` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `c[1]` to `c[n-2]` twice each, and `l` must have at least 1 element; `ans1` now includes the element `l[i]`, and `ans2` has appended `l[i]`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` was initially set to 0 and then decremented by 1, making `k` equal to -1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
