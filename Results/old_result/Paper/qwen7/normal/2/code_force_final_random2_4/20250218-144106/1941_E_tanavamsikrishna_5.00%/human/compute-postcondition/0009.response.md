Output State: **`total_costs` now contains the sum of costs from index `i + 2` to `i + k`, `i` is now `i + 2`, and `k` retains its previous value; `total_costs` is updated with the new sum.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of the costs from index `i + 2` to `i + k` to the list `total_costs`. After appending, `i` is updated to `i + 2`, and `k` retains its previous value. The initial conditions about `total_costs` and `i` are updated accordingly.
