Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, and `arr` is an empty list.**

In this case, the line `k0 = k` simply assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. No other variables are affected, and the initial state remains mostly unchanged except for the introduction of `k0` which is just a copy of `k`.
