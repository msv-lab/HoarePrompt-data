Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 5, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is 25, `lst` contains the values 3, 4, and 5, and the loop has executed `n-1` times.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the index `i` will be `n-1`. The variable `zero` remains 2 because it only increments when `s[i]` is '0', and we haven't encountered more than two zeros yet. Similarly, `one` is 1 as it only increments when `s[i]` is '1'. The percentages `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are calculated based on the counts of '0's and '1's seen so far. Since `lst` only appends values when both percentages reach 50, and given the conditions provided, `lst` will contain the values 3, 4, and 5.
