Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100; `freq` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for n in arr:
    freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the first element in the list, `freq` is a dictionary where the key is `n` and the value is the frequency of `n` in `arr` increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element, `n` is the first element in the list, `freq` is a dictionary where the key is `n` and the value is the frequency of `n` in `arr` increased by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element, `n` is the second element in the list, `freq` is a dictionary where the key is `n` and the value is the frequency of `n` in `arr` plus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
