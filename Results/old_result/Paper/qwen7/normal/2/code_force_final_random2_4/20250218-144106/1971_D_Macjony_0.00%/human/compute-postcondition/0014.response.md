Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `s` is the string input by the user and its length must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 1. If the character `s[j]` is '0' and the next character `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is set to True and `j` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `count`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `flag` remains False.
