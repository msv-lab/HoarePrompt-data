### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the original assessment.

#### Original Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each friendship and adds `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` to the result.
   - This calculation assumes that each friendship will be chosen exactly `k * (k + 1) // 2` times, which is incorrect because it doesn't account for the probability of choosing each friendship.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the result for each.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends.
- The expected value should be calculated by considering the probability of choosing each pair of friends in each excursion.
- The corrected version provided in the assessment correctly calculates the expected value by using the probability `1 / C(n, 2)` for each pair of friends.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The state descriptions match the logic of the program.

#### Correctness of the Original Program:
- The original program incorrectly calculates the expected value without considering the probability of choosing each pair of friends.
- The provided corrected version in the original assessment addresses this issue by calculating the expected value correctly.

Given the analysis, the original program is indeed incorrect, and the provided corrected version in the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends. The provided corrected version in the original assessment is correct.
