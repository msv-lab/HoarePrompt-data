Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current values**: Before the loop, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, and `numCuts` is 0.
3. **Check the loop condition**: With the current values, `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`, which is indeed greater than 1. Therefore, the loop can execute at least once.

Since the loop condition is already satisfied with the given values, no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
