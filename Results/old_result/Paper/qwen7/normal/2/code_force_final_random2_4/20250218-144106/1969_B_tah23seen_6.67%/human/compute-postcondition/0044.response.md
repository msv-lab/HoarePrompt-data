Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 4, `right` is `right + 1` and `s[right]` must not be '0'**.

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since `right` was previously within the bounds of `s` and `s[right]` was not '0', after incrementing `right`, it remains within the bounds of `s` and `s[right]` must still not be '0'. All other variables remain unchanged.
