Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `ans` contains `sums`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `sums` is preserved as it is being added to the list `ans`. Therefore, the updated state includes that `ans` now contains the value of `sums`, which is originally defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
