### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the solution and the correctness of the implementation. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure everything aligns with the problem statement and the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: `result` is initialized to 0.
   - **Loop**: The function iterates through each friendship and adds to `result` the product of the friendship value (`f`) and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`).
   - **Modulo Operation**: The final result is returned modulo `MOD`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of friendships.
   - **Function Call**: It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Sum of First `k` Natural Numbers**:
   - The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. This part is correct.

2. **Friendship Value Calculation**:
   - Each friendship value `f` is multiplied by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. This accounts for the fact that the friendship value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen, and this increase is cumulative over `k` excursions. This part is also correct.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers. This is necessary and correct.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and reads the necessary inputs for each test case. This part is also correct.

Given the detailed verification, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all aspects of the problem statement correctly.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
