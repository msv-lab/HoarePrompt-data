Output State: For each iteration of the loop, `s2` is a random permutation of the string `s`. The output will consist of either 'Yes' followed by `s2` (a random permutation of `s`) or 'No', depending on whether `s` is equal to `s2`. This process repeats for all iterations specified by the user input. After all iterations, the final state of `s2` for each `s` will be a random permutation of `s`, and the output will include all 'Yes' or 'No' statements along with their respective `s2` values as generated during the loop's execution.
