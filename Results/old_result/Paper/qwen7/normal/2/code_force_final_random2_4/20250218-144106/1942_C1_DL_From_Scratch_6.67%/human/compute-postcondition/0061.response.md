Output State: **`i` is -1, `num` is 1, `count` is 1, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial values of `i`, `num`, `count`, and `T` remain unchanged. The output state includes the new assignments for `n`, `x`, and `y`, along with the unchanged initial values of the other variables.
