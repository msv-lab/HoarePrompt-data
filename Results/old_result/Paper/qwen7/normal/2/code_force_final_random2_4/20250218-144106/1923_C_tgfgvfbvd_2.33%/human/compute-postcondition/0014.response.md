Output State: **`c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `p` is a list containing all cumulative sums of `l`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `c` will hold the total sum of all integers in the list `l`. Additionally, the list `p` will contain each cumulative sum of the elements in `l` as the loop progresses, starting from 0 up to the final sum of `l`.
