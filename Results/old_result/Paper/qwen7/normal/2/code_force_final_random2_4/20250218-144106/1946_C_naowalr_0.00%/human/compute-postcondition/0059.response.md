Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the first integer from user input; `b` is the second integer from user input; `adj[b]` now contains `a` appended to it; `i` is `n - 2`;**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[b]`. This operation modifies the list stored in `adj[b]` by adding `a` to it. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` and the initial inputs for `a` and `b` are preserved, and `i` remains as `n - 2`.
