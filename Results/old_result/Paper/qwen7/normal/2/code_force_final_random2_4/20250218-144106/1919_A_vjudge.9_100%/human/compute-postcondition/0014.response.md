Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1 (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `a` and `b` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user, separated by a space.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
