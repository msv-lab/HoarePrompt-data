Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` based on the value of `mod_x` which is `num % x`. The other variables (`num`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
