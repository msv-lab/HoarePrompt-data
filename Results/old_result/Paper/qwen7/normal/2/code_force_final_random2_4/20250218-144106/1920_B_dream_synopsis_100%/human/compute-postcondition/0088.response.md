Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing an additional element based on the conditions provided, and `sums` is equal to `sum1 + a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]`, which is `a[2]` since `i` is 3. The initial value of `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `a[2]` is the third element in the list (since indexing starts at 0). Therefore, `sums` is now the sum of `sum1` and `a[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
