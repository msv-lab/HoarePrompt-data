Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is 4
- `i` is 4
- `t` is 1
- `a` is a list of lists where the second sublist contains at least 4 elements
- `s` is a string 'input1input21'

The `print(s, sep='')` statement will print the string `s` with no separator between its characters. Since `sep=''`, it means there will be no space or any other character inserted between the characters of the string `s`.

Output: **input1input21**
