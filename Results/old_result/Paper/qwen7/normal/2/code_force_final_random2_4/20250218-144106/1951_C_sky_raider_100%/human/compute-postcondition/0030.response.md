Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - (n-1) * s`, `c` is the sum of `c + s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `n` is updated to the integer input, `m` and `k` are updated to the integers split from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation:
- The line `t = 0` sets the variable `t` to 0.
- All other variables (`i`, `s`, `c`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `l`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
