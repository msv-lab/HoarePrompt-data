Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `a` is `y1 - 1`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`**.

This means that the variable `a` is now assigned the value `y1 - 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
