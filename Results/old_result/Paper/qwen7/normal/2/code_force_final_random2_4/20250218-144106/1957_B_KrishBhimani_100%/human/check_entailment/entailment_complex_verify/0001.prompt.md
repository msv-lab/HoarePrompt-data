You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []

            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))

    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string for the last test case, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, and `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer. 
    #
    #If `n` equals 1, then `k` remains unchanged, and `ans` is simply `k` itself. Otherwise, `i` is the final value determined by the loop (either the number of times the loop executed or one less than that), `arr` is an empty list, `k0` equals `k`, `ans` is a list containing `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is 2 if `temp * 2 >= k` after the last iteration of the loop, otherwise `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`. `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))` to match the length of `n`.
    #
    #All other variables that were not affected by the loop remain in their initial or previously calculated states from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, if \( n = 1 \), it prints \( k \) directly. Otherwise, it calculates a list \( ans \) containing two elements: \((1 << i) - 1\) and \( k - \text{sum}(ans) \), where \( i \) is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \). The list \( ans \) is then extended with zeros to match the length \( n \). The function prints the final list \( ans \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case:**
   - If `n == 1`, the program simply prints `k`. This is correct because the sum must be `k`, and since there's only one element, it must be `k`.

3. **Multiple Elements Case:**
   - If `n > 1`, the program constructs an array `ans` with `n` elements.
   - It initializes `k0` to `k` and sets `i` to `0`.
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than `k` and appends `(1 << i) - 1` to `ans`. This value is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit used in `k`.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k` and appends the result to `ans`.
   - It fills the rest of the array with zeros.

4. **Binary OR Operation:**
   - The bitwise OR of the constructed array should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation.
   - Let's consider the example given in the problem statement:
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the program constructs `[3, 0]` (since `3 = 11_2` and `0 = 00_2`).
     - The bitwise OR of `[3, 0]` is `3`, which is `11_2` (two 1s).
   - However, another possible solution could be `[1, 2]`:
     - The bitwise OR of `[1, 2]` is `3`, which is `11_2` (two 1s).
   - Both solutions are valid, but the program only outputs `[3, 0]`.

5. **Sum Constraint:**
   - The sum of the elements in the array should be `k`.
   - The program ensures this by subtracting the largest power of 2 less than `k` from `k` and appending the result.

### Conclusion:

The program does not always find the optimal solution that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the array. Specifically, it always includes a large number (a power of 2 minus 1) and a small number to make up the difference, which may not always yield the maximum number of 1s.

For example, consider `n = 6` and `k = 51`:
- The program constructs `[31, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (since `31 = 11111_2` and `20 = 10100_2`).
- The bitwise OR of `[31, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0]` is `31`, which is `11111_2` (five 1s).

However, another valid solution could be `[3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]`:
- The bitwise OR of `[3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]` is `39`, which is `100111_2` (five 1s).

Thus, the program does not always find the optimal solution.
