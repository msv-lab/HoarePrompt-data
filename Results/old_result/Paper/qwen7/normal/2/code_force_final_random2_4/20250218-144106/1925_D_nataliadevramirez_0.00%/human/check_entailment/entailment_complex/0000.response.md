Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The formula used in the function is `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for each friendship value `f`. This formula accounts for the fact that each friendship value increases by 1 for every excursion when the pair is chosen.
   - The function iterates through each friendship, and for each friendship, it adds the contribution of that friendship value to the result. Since the probability of choosing any pair is the same, the expected value calculation is correct.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly processes each test case by reading the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships.
   - It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.
   - The function handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating through each test case and performing the necessary calculations.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program structure is correct, and both functions work together to solve the problem as described.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, and the modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.
   - The logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values is sound and implemented correctly.

Given the analysis, the program is designed to correctly solve the problem as per the provided problem statement and examples.

Correctness: **True**
