Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `pans`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(pans)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` has at least 2 elements.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `len(pans)`. Given that `pans` has at least 2 elements, `len(pans)` is at least 2. Therefore, `i` being 2 is valid as long as `pans` has at least 2 elements.

5. **Maintain Other States**: The state of `pans` remains the same since it does not change within the loop head. The value of `mak` is not relevant to the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted here.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `pans` has at least 2 elements**.
