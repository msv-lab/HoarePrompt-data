Output State: **`empty` is True, `t` is 1, `u` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5; `tree` is an empty deque.**

Explanation: The variable `empty` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, and `tree` remain unchanged from their initial states.
