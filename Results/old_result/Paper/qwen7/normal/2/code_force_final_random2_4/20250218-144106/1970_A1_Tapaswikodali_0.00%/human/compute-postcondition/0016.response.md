Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `(i, char) in enumerate(s)`. This means the loop is iterating over each character in the string `s` along with its index.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")".
   - `balance` is 0.
   - `details` is a list containing one additional tuple `(balance, -i, char)` where `balance` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in the string `s`, and `char` is the next character in the string `s`.
   - `i` is the index of the next character in the string `s`.

3. **Understand what happens in each iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate(s)`.
   - For each iteration, `i` is the index of the current character, and `char` is the current character itself.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, `i` will be incremented by 1 after each iteration.
   - `char` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `balance` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, it stays as 0.
   - `details` will contain one additional tuple `(0, -i, char)` for the next character in the string `s`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `balance` remains 0.
   - `details` will have one additional tuple `(0, -(i+1), char_next)`, where `char_next` is the next character in the string `s`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")", `balance` is 0, `details` is a list containing one additional tuple (0, -(i+1), char_next) where char_next is the next character in the string `s`, and `i` is the index of the next character in the string `s`**.
