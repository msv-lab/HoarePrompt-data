You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of buns, a is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. Additionally, 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, and 0 ≤ b ≤ min(n, b).
def func_2(n, a, b):
    low, high = 0, min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `low` is the final lower bound where the maximum profit is found, `high` is the final upper bound which is either `low` or one step above it, `max_profit` is the highest profit found during the iterations, `mid` is the last midpoint calculated, and `profit_next` is the profit calculated at `mid + 1`.
    #
    #In this final state, the algorithm has iteratively narrowed down the range `[low, high]` to find the optimal `mid` that maximizes the profit as determined by the function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. The variable `max_profit` holds the highest profit encountered throughout these iterations. The values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` reflect the last comparison made within the loop, with `low` being the best lower bound and `high` being the corresponding upper bound.
    return max_profit
    #The program returns the highest profit (`max_profit`) found during the iterations, with `low` being the final lower bound and `high` being the final upper bound which is either `low` or one step above it.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n, a, and b, and returns the highest profit found during the iterations along with the final lower and upper bounds.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the highest profit (`max_profit`) found during the iterations, with `low` being the final lower bound and `high` being the final upper bound which is either `low` or one step above it.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
