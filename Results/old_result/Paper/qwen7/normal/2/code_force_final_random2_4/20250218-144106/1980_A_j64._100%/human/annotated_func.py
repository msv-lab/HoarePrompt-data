#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `count` is [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], `char` is the last character of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for each character in the string `a`), the `count` array will have an increment for each unique character encountered in `a`. Since the loop has executed 3 times initially and we know the exact characters being processed up to the third one, we can infer that the remaining characters in `a` have been processed as well, resulting in a `count` array where each position corresponding to a character in the range 'A' to 'G' that appears in `a` will have a value of 1.
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
        
    #State: After the loop executes all 7 iterations, `i` will be 6. If any `count[i]` (for `i` from 0 to 6) is less than `m`, `needed_problems` will be incremented by `m - count[i]` for each such `i`. The final value of `needed_problems` will be the sum of all increments made during the loop iterations.
    return needed_problems
    #The program returns the total number of increments made to `needed_problems` based on the condition that for each `i` from 0 to 6, if `count[i]` is less than `m`, `needed_problems` is incremented by `m - count[i]` for each such `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 50), `m` (an integer between 1 and 5), and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). It counts the occurrences of each character in `a` and calculates the total number of additional problems needed such that each character type in the range 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times. The function returns this total count.
