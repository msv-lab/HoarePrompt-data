Output State: `shapes` is 3, `d` is a dictionary where each key from the list `palka` is mapped to its count in `palka`, and `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `shapes` will be 3 because the loop increments `shapes` by 1 for each iteration where the condition `d[j] >= 3` is met. The dictionary `d` will still hold the counts of each key from the list `palka`, as no changes are made to it within the loop body other than the condition check. The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, as no modifications are made to `pl` within the loop.
