Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**.

This means that the variable `v` has been assigned the return value of the function `func_2()`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
