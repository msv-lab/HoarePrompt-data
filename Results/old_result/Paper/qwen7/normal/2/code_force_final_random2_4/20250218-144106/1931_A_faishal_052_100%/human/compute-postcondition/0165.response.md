Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96` + the character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96, `temp` is updated by adding the character corresponding to `info[2][j] + 96` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates the `temp` variable by concatenating the character corresponding to `info[2][j] + 96` to the existing value of `temp`. Since `i` and `j` remain unchanged, their values are still 2 and 1 respectively. The value of `cases` remains a positive integer, and `temp` now includes an additional character based on the value of `info[2][j]`.
