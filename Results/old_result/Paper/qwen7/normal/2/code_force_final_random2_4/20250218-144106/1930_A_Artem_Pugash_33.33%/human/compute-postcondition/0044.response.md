Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of input integers, `suma` is the sum of `min(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop, where `a` and `b` are elements from `numbers`.**

Explanation: The code `numbers = input().split()` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to the variable `numbers`. Each element in the list is a string representation of an integer. The values of `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, and `suma` remain unchanged from their initial states.
