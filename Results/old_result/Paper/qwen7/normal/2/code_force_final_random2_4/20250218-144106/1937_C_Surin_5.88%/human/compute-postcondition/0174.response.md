Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the input integer, `r` is the input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is `n - 1` or any value between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, depending on the user's inputs ('>') during each iteration.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or affect the state of the variables. It only ensures that all buffered output is written to the console. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
