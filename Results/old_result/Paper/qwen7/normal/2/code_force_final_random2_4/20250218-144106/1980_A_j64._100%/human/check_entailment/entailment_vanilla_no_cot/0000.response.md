Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the given string `a` and calculates how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds. The function `func_1` is correctly defined to perform this calculation, and it is called appropriately within the main loop that processes each test case.
