Output State: **`i` is 20, `len(nums)` is 23, `idx` is either -1 or a value between 0 and 19, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums[-1]` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial values of `i`, `len(nums)`, `idx`, and `nums[-1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 20, `len(nums)` is still 23, `idx` is either -1 or a value between 0 and 19, and `nums[-1]` is still `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
