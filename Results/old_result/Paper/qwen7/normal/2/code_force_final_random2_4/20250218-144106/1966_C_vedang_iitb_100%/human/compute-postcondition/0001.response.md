Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `tc` and `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: We know that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `tc` is less than `t`.

Given that `t` is the input integer and `tc` is the loop variable that starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute if `tc < t`.

Since `t` is the only variable that controls the loop execution and `tc` starts at 0, the initial value of `t` must be such that the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring that the loop can execute at least once.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
