Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= 1000`.
2. **Current state**: The current state is `i` is 1.
3. **Determine if the loop should execute**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= 1000` must be true.
4. **Check the current value of `i`**: Currently, `i` is 1, which satisfies the condition `i <= 1000`.

Since the current value of `i` (which is 1) already satisfies the loop condition `i <= 1000`, no adjustments are necessary.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains the same.

**State: **`i` is 1**
