Output State: **`m` is 2 or less, `n` is an input integer, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and `_` is `m-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, `a2` is the second integer input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding elements equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` which contains only those elements from `l2` that are not equal to `a1`. The values of `m`, `n`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `_`, `a1`, `a2`, and `l11` remain unchanged.
