Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the array has duplicate elements correctly. 

Consider the following test case:
```
4
2
1 1
```

According to the problem description, the median of the array [1, 1] is 1. Since the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements in the sorted array. However, the program does not account for this and instead tries to increment elements until the median increases, which is not the correct approach.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify the median position and ensure that the element at that position is greater than the current median. The program should also handle the case where the array has duplicate elements properly.
