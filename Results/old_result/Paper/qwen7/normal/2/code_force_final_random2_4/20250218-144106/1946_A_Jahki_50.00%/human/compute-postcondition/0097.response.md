Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `new_median <= median`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `case` is an input string
   - `op` is incremented by 1
   - `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
   - `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b` and is now greater than `median` + 1
   - `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `b` is a sorted version of list `a`

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition is `new_median <= median`.
   - The only variables that can affect this condition are `new_median` and `median`.

4. **Adjust the variables**:
   - Since `new_median` is currently greater than `median` + 1, it cannot satisfy the loop condition `new_median <= median`.
   - To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust either `new_median` or `median` (or both) such that `new_median <= median` becomes true.

5. **Possible adjustments**:
   - Decrease `new_median` to make it less than or equal to `median`.
   - Increase `median` to make it greater than or equal to `new_median`.

Since `new_median` is already greater than `median` + 1, decreasing `new_median` is the straightforward way to satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `new_median` should be decreased to be less than or equal to `median`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `b` is a sorted version of list `a`.**
