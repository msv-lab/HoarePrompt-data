The loop condition is `u`, which is a non-zero value that has been decreased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `u` must be non-zero.

Given that `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, it means that `u` was a positive integer before the decrement. After the decrement, `u` is still non-zero, but to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `u` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `u` must be greater than 0.

State: **`u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0; `c` is the first return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`**
