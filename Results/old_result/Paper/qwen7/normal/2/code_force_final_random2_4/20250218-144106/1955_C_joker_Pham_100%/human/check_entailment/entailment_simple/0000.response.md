Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the `func_1` function step-by-step to ensure it correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships.

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively, and sets `sunks` to 0 to count the number of sunk ships.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Inside the loop, the function checks if `k` is 0, which would terminate the loop immediately.
   - If `l` and `r` are the same, it means only one ship remains. If this ship can be sunk with the remaining attacks (`k >= a[r]`), it is sunk, and the loop breaks.
   - The function then checks which ship (left or right) has lower durability and processes accordingly:
     - If the left ship has lower or equal durability, it attempts to sink the left ship completely (`a[l] * 2`). If enough attacks remain, it sinks the ship and adjusts `k` and `a[r]`. If the right ship is also sunk, it adjusts the right pointer.
     - If the right ship has lower durability, similar logic applies but with the right ship.
   - If at any point `k` is exhausted, the loop breaks.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop, the function returns the count of sunk ships (`sunks`).

Given the detailed logic and the constraints, the function correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships according to the problem statement. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code that would lead to incorrect results based on the provided problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
