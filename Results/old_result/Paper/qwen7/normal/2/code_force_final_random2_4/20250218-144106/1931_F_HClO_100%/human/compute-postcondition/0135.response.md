Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2`, `m` equals 2, the list `val` now has one more element which is a tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first element of the unpacked list while `l3` contains the rest of the elements, `a1` is inserted at index `idx2` in `l1` (now referenced by `l`), or `a2` is inserted at index `idx1` in `l2` (which is then assigned to `l`), and `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)` in the former case or greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)` in the latter case.**

In this output state, the list `val` has been updated to include a new tuple `(a3, l3)`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, and `l2` remain unchanged except that `l1` or `l2` is now referenced by `l` after inserting either `a1` or `a2` at the specified index. The condition regarding the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` also remains valid.
