Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is -1, `sum_f` is the total sum of all integers `f` entered by the user, `p` is `p // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (cn2) // gcd`**

Explanation: The code `q = q // gcd` updates the value of `q` by dividing it by `gcd`. Initially, `q` was set to `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`. After the operation, `q` becomes `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`. All other variables remain unchanged.
