Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` and `v` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers. If `v` is equal to the first element of the list `tree`, then `u` is appended to the left end of `tree`. If `v` is not equal to the first element of the list `tree`, then `v` is appended to the left end of `tree` if `v` is not already the last element of `tree`. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.
