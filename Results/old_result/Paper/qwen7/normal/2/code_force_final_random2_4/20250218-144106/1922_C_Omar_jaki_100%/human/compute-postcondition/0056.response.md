Output State: **`w` is the next element in `a`, `x` is the next element in `a[1:]`, `y` is the next element in `a[2:]`, `z` is the next element in `a[3:]`; `v` is `y - x`**.

This means that the value of `v` is calculated as the difference between `y` and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
