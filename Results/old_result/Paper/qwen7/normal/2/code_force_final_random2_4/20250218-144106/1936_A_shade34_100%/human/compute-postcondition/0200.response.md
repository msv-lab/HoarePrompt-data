Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is a string input from the user, and the current value of `s` is '<'**.

Explanation: The code `mak = i` updates the value of `mak` to be equal to the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is initially set to `n-1`, `mak` is now also `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
