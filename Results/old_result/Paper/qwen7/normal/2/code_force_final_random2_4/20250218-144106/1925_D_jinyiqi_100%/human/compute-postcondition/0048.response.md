Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `f` is an integer from the input**.

This means that the values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are now integers obtained from the input split by spaces. The exact values depend on the user's input, but they are guaranteed to be integers.
