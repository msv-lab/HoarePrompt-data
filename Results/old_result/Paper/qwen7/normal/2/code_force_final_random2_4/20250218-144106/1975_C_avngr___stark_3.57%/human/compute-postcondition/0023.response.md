Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is 0.**

The code `max = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `max`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
