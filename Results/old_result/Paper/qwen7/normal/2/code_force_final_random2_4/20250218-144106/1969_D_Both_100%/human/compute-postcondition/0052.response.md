Output State: **`item` is the second last element of `combined`, `combined` is modified (two elements less), `heap` is modified (pushed `removed_item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`, `max_profit` is unchanged if `current_profit` is not greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_profit -= item[1]` decreases `current_profit` by the value of `item[1]`.
- Since `item` was the last element of `combined`, after modifying `combined` (one element less), `item` now becomes the second last element.
- The other conditions and states remain unchanged as per the initial state, except for the modification in `current_profit`.
