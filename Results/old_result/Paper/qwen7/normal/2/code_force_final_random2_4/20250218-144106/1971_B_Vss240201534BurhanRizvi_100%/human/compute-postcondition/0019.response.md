Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism. If the length of `s` is 1, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If the length of `s` is greater than 1 and the set of characters in `s` contains exactly one unique character, then the function does nothing to `s`. Otherwise, `s` is either the string obtained by moving the first character of `s` to the end of `s`, or `s` remains unchanged.
