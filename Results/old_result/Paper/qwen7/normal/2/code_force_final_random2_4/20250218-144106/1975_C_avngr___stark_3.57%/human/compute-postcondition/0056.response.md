Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` remains the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. If `min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max`, then `max` is unchanged; otherwise, the condition does not change.
