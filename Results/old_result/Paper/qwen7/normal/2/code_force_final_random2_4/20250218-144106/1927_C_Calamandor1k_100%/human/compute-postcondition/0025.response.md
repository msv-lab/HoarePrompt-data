Output State: **`both` is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, `unique_b` is updated to be a set containing the unique elements from the list b, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from list a, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` where each element is less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` where each element is less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `results` is a list with at least two additional elements 'NO' and 'YES' appended to the results list.**

Explanation: The line `unique_b = set(b)` creates a new set `unique_b` which contains the unique elements from the list `b`. This operation does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged. The `results` list is modified by appending 'NO' and 'YES', but since the exact values of the other variables are not specified, they are left as described in the initial state.
