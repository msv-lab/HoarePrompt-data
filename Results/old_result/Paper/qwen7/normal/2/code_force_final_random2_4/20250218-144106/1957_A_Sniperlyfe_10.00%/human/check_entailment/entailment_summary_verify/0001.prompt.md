You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. It calculates the frequency of each stick length, then returns the sum of the integer division of these frequencies by 4.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks, where each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick and no stick can be reused.

2. **Key Points**:
   - A regular polygon with \( k \) sides requires \( k \) sticks.
   - To maximize the number of polygons, we need to find the smallest number of sticks among all stick lengths because the limiting factor will be the smallest number of sticks available for forming complete polygons.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks and their lengths.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the list of stick lengths.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It then calculates the number of complete polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (since a polygon has at least 3 sides, but the minimum we consider here is 4 for simplicity).
   - However, this approach does not correctly handle the limiting factor of the smallest number of sticks available for forming complete polygons.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - We should find the minimum value in the list of stick lengths.
   - The number of polygons that can be formed is the integer division of the total number of sticks by the minimum stick length.

6. **Corrected Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(arr):
       min_length = min(arr)
       return len(arr) // min_length
   ```

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of polygons. It incorrectly sums up the divisions by 4, which is not relevant to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
