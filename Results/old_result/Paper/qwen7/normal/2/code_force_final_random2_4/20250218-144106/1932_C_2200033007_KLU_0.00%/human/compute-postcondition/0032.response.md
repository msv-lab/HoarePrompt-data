Output State: **`b` is a non-empty list, `p` is `p * v`, `ans` is a list with the element `p * v`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `p` (which is `p * v`) to the list `ans`. Since `b` is a non-empty list and `p` is `p * v`, the output state includes these conditions. The list `ans` now contains the element `p * v`.
