Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is an integer value of `b`, and `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**

Explanation: 
- The initial value of `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The value of `t` is either `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0.
- The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
- The variable `b` is an integer value.
- The value of `t2` is `a - t1`.
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

Since `t2` is `a - t1`, the new value of `t` becomes `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.
