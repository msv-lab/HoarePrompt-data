### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` to determine if it correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts these lists.
   - It checks if the sorted list of digits is in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the sorted list of letters is in non-decreasing order.
   - It ensures that the last digit is not greater than the first letter (to ensure no digit comes after a letter).

2. **Conditions Check**:
   - The function correctly checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - The function correctly checks if the letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - The function correctly ensures that no digit comes after a letter by checking if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where the password consists only of digits or only of letters correctly.
   - For a password like `123abc`, the function will correctly identify it as a strong password because:
     - Digits: `1, 2, 3` are in non-decreasing order.
     - Letters: `a, b, c` are in non-decreasing order.
     - No digit comes after a letter.
   - For a password like `123wa`, the function will correctly identify it as a weak password because:
     - Digits: `1, 2, 3` are in non-decreasing order.
     - Letters: `w, a` are in non-decreasing order.
     - The last digit `3` is greater than the first letter `w`, violating the condition.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The function correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description.
   - It handles all edge cases appropriately.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly verifies the strength of the password based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
