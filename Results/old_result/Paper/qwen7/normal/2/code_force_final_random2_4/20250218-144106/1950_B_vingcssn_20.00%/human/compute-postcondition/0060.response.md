Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `c` is updated to `c + 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.

The print statement is `print('No esta en el rango')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs a string and does not depend on the values of `casos`, `t`, `c`, or `n`, the output will be exactly as written in the print statement.

Output: **No esta en el rango**
