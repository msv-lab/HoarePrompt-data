Output State: **`b` is a non-empty list minus its last element, `p` is the product of all elements in `b` multiplied by `v`, `ans` is a list with the element `p * v` added to the original list.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` by multiplying it with `v`. Since `p` was previously the product of all elements processed so far (which would be the product of all elements in `b`), the new value of `p` is now the product of all elements in `b` multiplied by `v`. The values of `b` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
