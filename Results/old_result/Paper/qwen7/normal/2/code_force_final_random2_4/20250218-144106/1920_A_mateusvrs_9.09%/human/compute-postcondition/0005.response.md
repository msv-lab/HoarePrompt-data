Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `_` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000.**

The code initializes `ax` to the integer value of `1000000000.0 + 7`, which is `1000000007`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
