Output State: **`x` is 4, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1.**

The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Given that `x` was initially 3, after executing this line, `x` becomes 4. The values of `y`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this operation.
