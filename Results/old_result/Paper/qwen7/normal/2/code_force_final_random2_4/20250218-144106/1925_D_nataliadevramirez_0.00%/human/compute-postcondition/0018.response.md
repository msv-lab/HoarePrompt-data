The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the number of children), `m` (an integer representing the number of pairs of friends), `k` (an integer representing the number of excursions), and `friendships` (a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers [a_i, b_i, f_i] representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively). The function does not return any value directly but processes the input parameters to perform some operations related to the children, their friendships, and the excursions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t, n, m, k, and friendships. It processes these parameters to handle a certain number of test cases involving children, their friendships, and excursions.**
