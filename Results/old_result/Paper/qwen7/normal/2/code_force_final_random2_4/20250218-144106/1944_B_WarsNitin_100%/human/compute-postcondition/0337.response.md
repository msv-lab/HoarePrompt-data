Output State: **`k` is -2, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, the only effect is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. The values of the other variables (`k`, `req`, `ans1`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged.
