Output State: **`max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` is `current_profit - removed_item[0]`, `combined` is now a list with one item less than before (since `item = combined.pop()`), `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped.**

Explanation: The code subtracts the value of `removed_item[0]` from `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The `removed_item` is assumed to be a tuple containing two elements, and its first element is used to update `current_profit`.
