Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to its original value (`i`).
   - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` will be equal to `curr_v + 1`.
   - `curr_v` will be equal to the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if `i` was `i-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `i` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged within the loop.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will still be equal to its original value (`i`).
- `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` will still be equal to `curr_v + 1`.
- `curr_v` will still be equal to the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i`.

However, since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 1`**.
