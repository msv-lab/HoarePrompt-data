Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `unique_a` is a set containing elements from `a`, `results` list now contains 'YES', `unique_b` is a set containing elements from `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new set `relevant_b` which contains elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
