Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s2` is the string `s` rotated by one character to the left**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` rotates the string `s` by one character to the left, making the first character of `s` the last character of `s2`, and all other characters shift one position to the left. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the operation.
