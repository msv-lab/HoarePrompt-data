Output State: **`cnt` is `[5, 2, 1]`, `ans` is `8`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `a`. The values of `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
