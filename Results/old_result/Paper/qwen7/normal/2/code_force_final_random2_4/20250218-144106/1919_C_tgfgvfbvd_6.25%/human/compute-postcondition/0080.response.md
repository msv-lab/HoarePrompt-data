Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `b` is the value at index `x` of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `b`. Given that `x` is equal to `n`, `b` will be the value at index `n` of list `l`. The other variables (`n`, `y`, and `x`) retain their initial values.
