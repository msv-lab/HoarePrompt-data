Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` which is `a[1]` and onwards, `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]), and either both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are True, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or at least one of `check_all_new` or `new_all` is False, in which case we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
