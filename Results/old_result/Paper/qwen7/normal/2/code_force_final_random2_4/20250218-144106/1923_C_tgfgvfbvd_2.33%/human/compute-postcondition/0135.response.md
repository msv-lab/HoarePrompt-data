Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p`, `a` is updated to the first input integer, `b` is updated to the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `m`, `s`, and the list `p` remain unchanged from their initial state.
