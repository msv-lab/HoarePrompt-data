Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. This means the loop variable is `result` and the iterable is `results`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: Since the loop is iterating over each element in `results`, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `result` and `results`.

3. **Analyze the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one more element in `results` to iterate over.
   - After the current iteration, `result` will be set to the next element in `results`.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - We don't know the exact value of `result` from the previous iteration, but we know it has just finished processing one element.

5. **Next iteration state**:
   - `result` will be set to the next element in `results`.
   - `results` should still be an iterable with at least one more element to process.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is:

**State: **`result` is the next element in `results`, `results` must have at least one more element**.
