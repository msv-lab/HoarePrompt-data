Output State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input, `m` is `n - num`**.

This output state reflects that the variable `m` is now assigned the value of `n - num`, while all other variables retain their previous states. The value of `num` remains an integer between `k` and `2*k`, and `i` stays at `k-1`.
