Output State: **`a` is a list containing ['input1', 'input2', 'input3', 'input4'], `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `y`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `y` is updated to 1, while `a`, `x`, `i`, and `n` retain their original values.
