Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of three positive integers t, n, and a, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. For each test case, if t is within the specified range, it checks the relationship between n and a, and returns "equal" if n equals a, "less" if n is less than a, and "greater" if n is greater than a. If t is out of the specified range, it returns an error message indicating that t is not valid.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases (up to 10,000) where each test case includes three integers. It then compares the second integer (n) with the third integer (a) and returns whether n is equal to, less than, or greater than a, depending on the value of the first integer (t). If t is outside the allowed range, it indicates an invalid input.
