Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is equal to 0, and `ans1` contains the value of `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing the code, `i` is incremented to 2 (assuming `i` is incremented before the append operation, which is common practice). The value of `ans1` now contains `b[2]` because `i` is 2. The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged.
