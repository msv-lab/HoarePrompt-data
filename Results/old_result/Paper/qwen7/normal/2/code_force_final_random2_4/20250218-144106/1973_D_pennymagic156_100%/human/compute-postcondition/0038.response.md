Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` must be at least 3, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` to be `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`, `l` will be one more than that returned value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
