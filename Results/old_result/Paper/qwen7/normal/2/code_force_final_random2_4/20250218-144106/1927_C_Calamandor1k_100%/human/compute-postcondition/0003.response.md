Output State: **`unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` in each tuple of `cases`; `cases` is a non-empty list, each tuple in `cases` contains valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k` as specified, and arrays `a` and `b` in each tuple are valid lists of integers within the specified range; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from list `a` in each tuple of `cases`.**

Explanation: The code `unique_b = set(b)` creates a set of unique elements from the list `b` in each tuple of `cases`. The sets `unique_a` and the structure of `cases` remain unchanged.
