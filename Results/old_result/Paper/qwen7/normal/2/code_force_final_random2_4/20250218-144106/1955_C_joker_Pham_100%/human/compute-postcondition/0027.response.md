The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, we assume that the `continue` statement is inside a loop. However, the exact loop structure is not provided, so we focus on the variables that are explicitly mentioned and their changes.

- `l` is incremented by 1.
- `r` is set to `n - 2`.
- `sunks` is incremented by 2.
- The value of `a[r]` is 0.

The `continue` statement does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `sunks`, and the condition that `a[r]` is 0. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the variables that are updated.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` is now n - 2, `sunks` is equal to `sunks + 2`, and the value of `a[r]` is 0.**
