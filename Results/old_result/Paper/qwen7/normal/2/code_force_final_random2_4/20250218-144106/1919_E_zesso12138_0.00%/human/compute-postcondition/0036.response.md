Output State: **All iterations of the loop have finished, resulting in `results` being a list containing the return values from `func_1(n, p)` for every segment of integers extracted from `data`. The `index` variable points to the position immediately following the last segment of integers processed, `t` is 0, `p` contains all integers from the specified segments of `data` concatenated together, `data` remains unchanged, and `results` is a comprehensive list of all the results returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `results` will hold the outcomes of applying `func_1(n, p)` to every segment of integers derived from `data`, starting from the initial `index` and extending by `n` for each subsequent segment until no more segments can be found. The `index` will be updated to reflect the end of the last processed segment, `t` will be reset to 0, and `p` will be a single list containing all integers from these segments.
