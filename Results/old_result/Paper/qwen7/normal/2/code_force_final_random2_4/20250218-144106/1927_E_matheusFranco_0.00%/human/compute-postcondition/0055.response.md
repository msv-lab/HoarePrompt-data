Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`multiples_of_k_plus_i`**: This is given as `n * k`.
2. **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]`**: This is given as `n + (n // k)`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n * k`, this means `permutation[n * k]` is `n + (n // k)`.
3. **`i`**: This is explicitly given as `0`.
4. **`curr_v`**: This is explicitly given as `n`.
5. **`result`**: This is a string containing space-separated values from the `permutation` list starting from the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` up to the end. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n * k`, `result` will contain the elements of `permutation` from index `n * k` to the end of the list.

Given these details, let's determine what `result` will be:

- The `permutation` list is not explicitly defined, but we know that `permutation[n * k]` is `n + (n // k)`.
- The `result` string starts from index `n * k` and goes to the end of the `permutation` list.

Since the exact `permutation` list is not provided, we can only describe the start of `result` based on the given information. The first element of `result` is `permutation[n * k]`, which is `n + (n // k)`.

Therefore, the output will be a string starting with `n + (n // k)` followed by the rest of the elements in the `permutation` list from index `n * k` onwards.

Output: **n + (n // k) [followed by the rest of the elements in the permutation list from index n * k to the end]**
