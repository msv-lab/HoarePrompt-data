Output State: **`li` is a list with two elements: `a + k * c` and `a + k * c + d`, `h` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. Given that `h` is 1, the expression simplifies to `a + k * c + d`. Initially, `li` had one element which was `a + k * c + d * 0`, i.e., `a + k * c`. After appending, `li` now contains `a + k * c` and `a + k * c + d`. The values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged.
