Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the program to exit the current loop or conditional block without changing the values of `i`, `n`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2`.
