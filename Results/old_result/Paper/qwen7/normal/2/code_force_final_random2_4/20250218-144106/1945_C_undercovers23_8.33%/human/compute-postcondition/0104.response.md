Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code `zero += 1` increments the value of `zero` by 1. Initially, `zero` is assumed to be 0 (since no other value is given), so after executing the code, `zero` becomes 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and the current value of `s[i]` remain unchanged.
