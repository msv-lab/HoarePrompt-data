#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `b` is a list containing all elements from `a` in the order specified by `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is an empty list, `p` is the product of all elements in the original list `b`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, starting from the last element.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `b` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The variable `p` will hold the product of all elements in the original list `b`. The list `ans` will contain the cumulative product of all elements in `b`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first, with each iteration's product being appended to `ans`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list `ans` containing the cumulative product of all elements in the original list `b`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` based on the directions given in `s`, then calculates the cumulative product of all elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this result as a reversed list `ans`.
