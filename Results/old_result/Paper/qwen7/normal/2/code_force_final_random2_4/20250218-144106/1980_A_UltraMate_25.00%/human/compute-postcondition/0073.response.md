Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 'E'.
- `p` is 'ABCDEF'.
- `ans` is initialized to `0 + 6*m` and then adjusted based on the condition `if hmp[i] < m`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `s` is the input string from the user.
- `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s` and includes the keys 'F', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E'.
- The character 'i' ('E') must be in the counter `hmp`.

Let's break down the calculation of `ans`:

1. `ans` starts as `0 + 6*m`.
2. For each character in `s`, if the count of that character in `hmp` is less than `m`, `ans` is decreased by `(m - hmp[char])`.

Since `i` is 'E' and it must be in `hmp`, let's consider the possible values:

- If `hmp['E'] >= m`, then the term `(m - hmp['E'])` will be zero, and `ans` remains unchanged.
- If `hmp['E'] < m`, then `ans` will be reduced by `(m - hmp['E'])`.

Given that `hmp` includes the keys 'F', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E', and considering the condition `if hmp[i] < m`, the only guaranteed reduction in `ans` is due to the character 'E'.

Therefore, the final value of `ans` will be:

\[ \text{ans} = 6m - (m - hmp['E']) = 5m + hmp['E'] \]

Since `hmp['E']` is the count of 'E' in the string `s`, and without knowing the exact count, we express it as `hmp['E']`.

Output: **5m + hmp['E']**
