Output State: **`unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` in each tuple of `cases`; `cases` is a non-empty list, each tuple in `cases` contains valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k` as specified, and arrays `a` and `b` in each tuple are valid lists of integers within the specified range; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from list `a` in each tuple of `cases`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` where each element is less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` where each element is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new set `relevant_b` which contains only those elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`. The other variables (`unique_b`, `cases`, `unique_a`, and `relevant_a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
