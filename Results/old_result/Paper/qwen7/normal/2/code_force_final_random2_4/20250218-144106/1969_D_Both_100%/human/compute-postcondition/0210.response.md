Output State: **`max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` or remains 0; `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`; `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; `k` is less than or equal to 0; and `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped.**

Explanation: The code updates `current_profit` by adding the first element of `item` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
