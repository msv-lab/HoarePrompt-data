Output State: **`i` is equal to `bets`, `ans` is a string containing the character `str(a[i])` followed by a space, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. The values of `i` and `bets` remain unchanged from their initial state.
