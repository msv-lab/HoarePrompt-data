Output State: **`mak` is an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive), `mak2` equals `mak`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop executed; `pans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `pans`. No other changes are made to the variables `mak`, `mak2`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, and a new empty list `pans` is created.
