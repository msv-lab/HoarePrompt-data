Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` is the original array, `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of the original sequence `a`. If `a[2]` (which is `a[i-1]`) is greater than `a[3]` (which is `a[i]`), then `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise it is False. `new_all` is the result of the condition check [(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]. In either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
