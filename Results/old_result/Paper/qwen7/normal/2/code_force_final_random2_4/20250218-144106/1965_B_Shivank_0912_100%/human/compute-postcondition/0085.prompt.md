Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The values of `n` and `k` are not yet defined, and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    i = 0
    while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
        i = i + 1
    ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
    for j in range(20):
        if j != i:
            ans.append(1 << j)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `ans` contains all integers from 1 to 1024 (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The variable `i` remains 10, `k` remains at least 1024, and `ans` is a list containing the values from 1 to 1024 (inclusive) with a step of 1, except when `j` equals `i`, in which case the value 1023 is not included.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 19 and `ans` is a list containing the values from 1 to 20, as long as `i` is not equal to `j`. If `i` is equal to `j`, the list `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
