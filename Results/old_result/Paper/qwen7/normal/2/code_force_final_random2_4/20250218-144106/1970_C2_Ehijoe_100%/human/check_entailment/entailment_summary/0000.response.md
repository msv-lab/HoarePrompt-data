Reasoning:
1. The problem statement describes a game where Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone on a tree, starting from different nodes in each round. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move.
2. The provided code has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_2` reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines if the first player (Ron) can win by calling `func_1`.
4. `func_1` checks if there is any way to make a valid move from the given start node. If there is, it returns `True` (indicating Ron can win), otherwise `False` (indicating Hermione can win).

Given the problem constraints and the provided functions:
- `func_2` correctly constructs the tree and identifies the starting node.
- `func_1` correctly checks if there is a valid move from the start node, which aligns with the game's rules.

Since `func_2` uses `func_1` to determine the winner and the logic seems to match the problem description, the overall program should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
