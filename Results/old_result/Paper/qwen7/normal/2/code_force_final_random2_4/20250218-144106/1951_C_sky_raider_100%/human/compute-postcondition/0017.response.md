Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `t` is `s * (l[0] + 1)`
   - `s` is `min(m, k)`
   - `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t)`
   - `k` is `k - 3s`

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so for the loop to continue, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0, it remains unchanged.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `i` becomes 3
   - `n` remains greater than 0
   - The values of `t`, `s`, `c`, and `k` are derived from the expressions involving `m`, `k`, and `l`, but these expressions are not affected by the loop incrementing `i`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `s * (l[0] + 1)`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t)`, `k` is `k - 3s`**
