Output State: **`max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`; `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`; `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; `k` is less than or equal to 0; `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped; `removed_item` is the item that was heappushedpoped from the heap; `combined` is now one item shorter since the last item was popped.**

Explanation: The code sets `max_profit` to be equal to `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `max_profit` is now equal to whatever value `current_profit` held before the assignment, while `current_profit` itself is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`.
