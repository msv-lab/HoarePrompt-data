To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

### Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - For each friendship pair \((a, b)\) with friendship value \( f \), the function adds \( f \times \text{expected number of times the pair is chosen} \) to the result.
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in \( k \) excursions is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - However, the function simplifies this to \( f \times \left(k \times \frac{k + 1}{2}\right) \), which is an approximation assuming uniform distribution and independence of choices.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

### Correctness Check

1. **Friendship Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used in `func_1` for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=0}^{m} f_i \times \left(k \times \frac{k + 1}{2}\right)
     \]
   - This formula assumes that each pair is chosen uniformly and independently, which might not be entirely accurate due to the dependency introduced by the increase in friendship value after being chosen.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at the end, which is correct for handling large numbers.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct and follows the problem statement.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` uses a simplified approach to calculate the expected value, which might not fully capture the dependencies introduced by the increasing friendship values. However, the problem statement mentions that the answer can always be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and the result should be calculated as \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution might not fully meet the requirements of the problem, but it is close enough for most practical purposes and passes the given examples.

### Final Answer

**Correctness: False**

The function `func_1` does not fully account for the dependencies introduced by the increasing friendship values, and thus the solution might not be completely correct for all edge cases.
