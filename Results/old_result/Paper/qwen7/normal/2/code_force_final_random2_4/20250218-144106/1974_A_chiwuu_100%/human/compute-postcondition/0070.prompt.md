You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the final value of `t` will be determined based on the last iteration's conditions. Specifically, `t` will be updated according to the logic inside the loop. If `t1 >= a` in the last iteration, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, or `t + t2 // 15` otherwise, where `t2 = a - t1`. The value of `n` will be decremented to 0 after the loop completes, and `i` will be equal to `n`. The values of `a` and `b` will be the last values provided by the user during the loop iterations. The variable `t1` will be the result of the last calculation, which is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
    #
    #In summary, `t` will reflect the cumulative effect of all iterations, with the final update being based on the comparison between `t1` and `a` in the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
