Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the actual game mechanics where a player removes a facing-up coin and flips its adjacent coins. Instead, it simply counts the number of facing-up coins and decides the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. This approach is incorrect because it does not simulate the game's state transitions and outcomes accurately.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game according to the rules provided, keeping track of the state of the coins after each move and determining the winner based on optimal play from both players.
