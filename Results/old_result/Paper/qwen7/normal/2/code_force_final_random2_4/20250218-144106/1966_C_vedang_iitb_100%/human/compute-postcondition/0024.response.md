Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` must have at least one element.
- `mexsize` will be incremented by 1 every time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`.
- The final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the value of `mexsize`:

1. `mexsize` starts at 1.
2. It is incremented by 1 every time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`.
3. This process continues until `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in `a`.

Given that `a` must have at least one element, let's consider the possible scenarios:

- If `a` contains only even numbers, `mexsize` will eventually become 1 (since it starts at 1 and is not present in the list).
- If `a` contains both even and odd numbers, `mexsize` will eventually become the smallest odd number not present in `a`.
- If `a` contains only odd numbers, `mexsize` will eventually become 1 (since it starts at 1 and is not present in the list).

In any case, `mexsize` will be an odd number because it starts at 1 and increments by 1, ensuring it remains odd until it finds the smallest missing positive integer.

Since `mexsize` is odd, the condition `mexsize % 2 == 1` evaluates to `True`.

Therefore, the print statement will output "Alice".

Output: **Alice**
