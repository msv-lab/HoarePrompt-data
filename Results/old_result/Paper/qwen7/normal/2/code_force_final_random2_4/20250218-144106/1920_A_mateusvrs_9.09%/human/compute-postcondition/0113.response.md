Output State: **`cx` contains at least one element (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element from `cx`, `tmp` is incremented by 2**.

Explanation: The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Given that `tmp` was incremented by 1 before this line, it is now incremented by 2 in total. The states of `cx` and `i` remain unchanged.
