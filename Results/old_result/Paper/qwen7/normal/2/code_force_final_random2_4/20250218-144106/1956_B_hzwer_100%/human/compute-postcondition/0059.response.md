Output State: `cnt` is [3, 3, 0], `ans` is 8, `a` is a list of integers.

Explanation: Given that the loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`, and considering the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the list `a` contained at least 3 integers. After executing the loop 3 times, the count for the integer present twice (second element) is updated to 3, and the count for the integer present once (first element) is also updated to 3. The third element's count remains 0 as it did not appear in the list `a`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged at 8, and `a` is no longer referenced in the final state since it has been fully processed.
