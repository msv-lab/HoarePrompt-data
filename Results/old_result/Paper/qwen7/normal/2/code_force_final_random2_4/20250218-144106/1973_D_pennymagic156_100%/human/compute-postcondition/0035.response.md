Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is decremented by 1. Initially, `cnt` was equal to `k - 1`. After decrementing, `cnt` becomes `k - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
