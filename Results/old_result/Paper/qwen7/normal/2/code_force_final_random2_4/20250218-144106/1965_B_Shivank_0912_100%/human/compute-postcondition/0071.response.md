Output State: **`j` is 0; `ans` is a list containing the value 1; `i` is not equal to `j`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` (which is `1` since `j` is `0`) to the list `ans`. The value of `j` remains `0`, and the condition that `j` is not equal to `i` is still valid.
