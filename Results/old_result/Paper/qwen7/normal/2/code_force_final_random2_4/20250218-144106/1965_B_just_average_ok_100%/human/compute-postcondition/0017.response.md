Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The line `idx = i - 1` updates the value of `idx` to be `i - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `idx` is updated to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged.
