Output State: **`op` is 0, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, and `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`.**

Explanation: The code `ma = int(num2 / 2)` assigns the value of `num2 / 2` (converted to an integer) to the variable `ma`. Since `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `ma` will be an integer representing half of `num2`, rounded down. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
