Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2)`. The only variable involved here is `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `m` must be greater than 2.
   - `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int.
   - `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input converted to int.
   - `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `m > 2`, and we know `m` was greater than 2 at the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `m` must be greater than 1 (since it was originally greater than 2 and is now decremented by 1).

5. **Maintain other states**: The other states (`a3`, `l3`, and `val`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`)**
