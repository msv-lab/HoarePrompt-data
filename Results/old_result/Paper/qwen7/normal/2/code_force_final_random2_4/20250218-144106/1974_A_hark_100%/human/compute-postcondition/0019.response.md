Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer, `k` must be between 0 and `ap`-1 (inclusive), `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0, then `x` remains greater than 0 and `y` remains equal to 0. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is greater than 0.
