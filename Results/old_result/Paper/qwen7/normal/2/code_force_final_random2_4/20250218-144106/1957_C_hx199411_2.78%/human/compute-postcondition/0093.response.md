Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is 1, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is the total number of inputs processed, `m` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of 3 zeros with `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and `dp[3] = 8, `dp[4] = 26**.

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i]` where `i` is 4. According to the formula, `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, substituting the known values:

- `dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[4] = (8 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[4] = (8 + 18) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[4] = 26 % (10 ** 9 + 7)` which is 26 since 26 is less than \(10^9 + 7\).

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
