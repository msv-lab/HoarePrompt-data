Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `y` is 2; `b` is the value at index 2 of list `l`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `y`, or `b`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 and the values of `y` and `b` remain unchanged.
