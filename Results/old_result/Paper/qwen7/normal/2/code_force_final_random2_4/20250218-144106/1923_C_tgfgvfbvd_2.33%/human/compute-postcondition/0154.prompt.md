Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is an empty list; `c` is the sum of all elements in the original list `l`; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p`. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0 and `s` is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray defined by indices `a-1` to `b-1` (and the length of this subarray is greater than 1), then `s` is decreased by `p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is decreased by the element at index `a - 2` of the list `p`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `p[b - 1]` is decreased by `p[a - 2]`. If `a - 2 < 0`, then no change is made to `p[b - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
