### Reasoning:

1. **Functionality Check**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` correctly handles three main scenarios:
     - When `n == k`: It prints "YES" and outputs 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, which ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
     - When `n < k`: It prints "NO" and returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
     - When `n >= k`: It calculates the minimum number of stalls needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - For `n >= k`, the function calculates the costs `[n - k + 1, 1]` to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - It then iterates through these costs, reducing `n` accordingly and updating `h` (the number of stalls).
   - If the total number of stalls (`h`) is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2 (indicating 2 stalls), "YES", and the list of costs.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases like `n == k` and `n < k`.
   - For `n >= k`, it ensures that the total number of stalls is at most 60, which is within the constraints.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided function `func_1(n, k)` correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and it handles all the specified scenarios appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
