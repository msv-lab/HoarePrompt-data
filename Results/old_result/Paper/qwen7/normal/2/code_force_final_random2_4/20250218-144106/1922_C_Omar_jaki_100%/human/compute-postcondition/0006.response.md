Output State: **`t` is a non-empty tuple of integers where each element is decreased by 1, `a` is -1000000000.0, `b` is [0, 0], `*r()` is undefined, 2000000000.0**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `b` with two zeros `[0, 0]`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `*r()`, or the number `2000000000.0`. Therefore, these values remain unchanged from their initial states.
