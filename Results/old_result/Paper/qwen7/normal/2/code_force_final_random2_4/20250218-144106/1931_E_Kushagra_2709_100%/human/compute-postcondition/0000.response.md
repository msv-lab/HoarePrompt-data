Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The code snippet `num = str(num)` converts the integer `num` into its string representation. Since the initial state specifies that `num` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^9\), after executing the code, `num` will now hold a string value that represents the same integer. All other information about the range remains valid, just the type of `num` changes from an integer to a string.
