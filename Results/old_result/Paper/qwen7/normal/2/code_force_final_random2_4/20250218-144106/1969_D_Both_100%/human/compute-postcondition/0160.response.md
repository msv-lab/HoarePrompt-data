Output State: **`prices` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `heap` is an empty list, `current_profit` is reduced by the total of all `removed_item[0]` values from each iteration, `max_profit` is the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during any iteration, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is empty after all iterations, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, and `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `neg_prices` is a list of the negated values from `prices`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]` creates a new list `neg_prices` where each element is the negated value of the corresponding element in the original `prices` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
