Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.
- `i` is equal to `bets`.
- `bets` is greater than 0.
- `prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets - 1`.
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`. The values of `sumo`, `i`, `bets`, and `prod` are not relevant to this particular print statement, as it does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **-1**
