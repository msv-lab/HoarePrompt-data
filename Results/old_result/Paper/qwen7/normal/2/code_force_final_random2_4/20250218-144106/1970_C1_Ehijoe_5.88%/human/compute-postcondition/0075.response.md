Output State: **`start` is an input integer, `i` is `start-1`, the deque `tree` is empty.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `start`. The variable `i` is initialized to `start - 1`. At this point, the deque `tree` is not modified by the given code snippet, so it remains empty. The initial state of `i` is updated to `start - 1`, and the value of `start` is now known.
