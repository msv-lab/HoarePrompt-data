Reasoning:
1. The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
2. The provided program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`), then divides this product by each multiplier to get the amount to bet on each outcome.
3. It then sums these amounts (`sumo`) and checks if this sum is greater than or equal to the original product.
4. If the sum is greater than or equal to the product, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.
5. Otherwise, it prints the calculated bets for each outcome.

This approach works because:
- The product of all multipliers (`prod`) represents the total potential return if all outcomes were winning.
- Dividing this product by each multiplier gives the minimum amount that needs to be bet on that outcome to ensure the total bet is less than the potential return for that outcome.
- Summing these amounts ensures the total bet is less than the potential return for any single outcome.

Given the logic, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
