Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables that are used within the loop. In this case, the loop uses the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (since the range function in Python is inclusive of the start value but exclusive of the stop value).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is 1 and that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is `t - 2`
- `n` is an input integer
- `line` is an input string from the user
- `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` by spaces and converting each part to an integer
- `a` is a list containing the single integer 1000

We only need to adjust the states related to the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1

The final answer is:
**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
