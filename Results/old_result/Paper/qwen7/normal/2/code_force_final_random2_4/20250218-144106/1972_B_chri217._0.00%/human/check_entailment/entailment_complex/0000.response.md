Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins.
2. The provided solution reads all input at once and processes each test case individually.
3. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of coins facing up ('U') and checks if this count is odd.
4. If the count of 'U' is odd, the function returns 'YES', indicating Alice wins. Otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating Bob wins.
5. Given the rules of the game, the count of 'U' being odd is indeed a winning condition for Alice because she can always make a move that leaves an even number of 'U' coins for Bob, forcing him into a losing position eventually.
6. The logic implemented in `func_1` aligns with the problem's requirements and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
