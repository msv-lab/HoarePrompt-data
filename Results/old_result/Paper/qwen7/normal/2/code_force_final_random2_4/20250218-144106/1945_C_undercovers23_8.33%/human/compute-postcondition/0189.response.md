Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100.**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 0 and `zero` is 1 because `s[0]` is '0'. The code calculates `zero_perc` using the formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Substituting the known values, `zero_perc` becomes `math.ceil(1 * 100 / (0 + 1))`, which simplifies to `math.ceil(100)`, resulting in `100`. The other variables remain unchanged.
