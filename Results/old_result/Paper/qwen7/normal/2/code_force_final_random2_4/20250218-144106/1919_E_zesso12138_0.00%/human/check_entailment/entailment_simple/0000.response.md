Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of initial arrays \(a\) of size \(n\) consisting of only 1 and -1, such that their prefix sums, when sorted, match a given sorted prefix sum array \(p\).
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates the number of ways to construct the initial array \(a\) based on the given sorted prefix sum array \(p\). It uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations.
   - **func_2**: This function processes multiple test cases, reading input, calling `func_1` for each test case, and printing the results.

3. **Dynamic Programming Explanation**:
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` correctly models the problem by considering the transitions between prefix sums. The `dp` array keeps track of the number of ways to achieve each prefix sum value.
   - The logic ensures that the transitions respect the constraints of the problem (i.e., each element in \(a\) is either 1 or -1).

4. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The input is read efficiently using `sys.stdin.read`, and the results are printed correctly.
   - The function handles multiple test cases as expected, processing each one independently.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code correctly handles the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\) and the modulo operation to handle large numbers.
   - The logic for calculating the final result is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
