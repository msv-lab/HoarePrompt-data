Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in a:`. The objects involved here are `x`, `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` is the variable that will take on each element of the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a` is the list of integers.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.
   - Before the loop starts, `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is the variable that will change during each iteration, we don't need to specify its initial value (it will be set to the first element of `a` during the first iteration).
   - We need to ensure that `a` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are related to the list `a`. Specifically, `a` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`**
