Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find and remove the substrings "map" and "pie" to make the string beautiful.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` has a flaw:
     - It only checks for the exact substring "mapie" and returns 1 if found. This is incorrect because "mapie" is not a valid substring to check for.
     - It uses a while loop to find and remove "map" and "pie" substrings, but this approach is flawed because it does not handle overlapping occurrences correctly.

3. **Handling Substrings:**
   - To correctly handle the removal of "map" and "pie", we should use a different approach:
     - We need to find all occurrences of "map" and "pie" and remove them efficiently.
     - We should keep track of the minimum deletions required to remove all instances of these substrings.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Instead of using multiple while loops, we can use a single loop to find and remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".
   - We should also ensure that we do not double-count overlapping substrings.

### Corrected Program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i:i+3] == 'map' or s[i:i+3] == 'pie':
            ans += 1
            i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters
        else:
            i += 1
    return ans
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The function `func_1` iterates through the string `s` and checks for the substrings "map" and "pie".
- When a match is found, it increments the counter `ans` and skips the next 3 characters.
- This ensures that overlapping substrings are handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original program was incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function. The corrected program handles the problem correctly by iterating through the string and counting the minimum deletions needed to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

**Correctness: False**
