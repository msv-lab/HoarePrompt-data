Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cost` to 0. Since `sChar`, `i`, `s`, and `left` were already defined and their values were unchanged, they remain the same. The new variable `cost` is introduced and set to 0.
