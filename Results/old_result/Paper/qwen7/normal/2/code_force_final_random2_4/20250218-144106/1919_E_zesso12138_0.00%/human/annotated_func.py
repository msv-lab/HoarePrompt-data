    #State: Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list of length \(2n + 1\) where each element is calculated based on the cumulative sum of its adjacent elements from the previous iteration, modulo `MOD`. Specifically, for each valid index \(j\) (0 to \(2n\)), the value of `dp[j]` will be the sum of `dp[j-1]` and `dp[j+1]` from the previous iteration, taken modulo `MOD`. After all iterations, `i` will be \(n + 1\), and `new_dp` will be assigned the final values of `dp`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` list will contain the values resulting from the specified update rule applied iteratively, starting from an initial condition where only `dp[n]` is 1 and all others are 0. The final `dp` list will reflect the cumulative effect of adding adjacent values from the previous state, wrapped around the list boundaries using modulo arithmetic.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value of `dp` at index `final_sum`, where `final_sum` is `p[-1] + offset` and `dp` reflects the cumulative effect of adding adjacent values from the previous state, taken modulo `MOD`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), and `p`, a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer's absolute value is less than or equal to `n`. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` and updates it through a series of iterations, where each element in `dp` is updated based on the sum of its adjacent elements from the previous iteration, taken modulo `MOD`. After completing the iterations, it calculates `final_sum` as `p[-1] + offset` and returns the value of `dp` at this index.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.

    #State: Output State: `index` is increased by the sum of all `n` values encountered during the loop iterations, `t` is 0 (since it decreases by 1 each iteration and starts from a value greater than 0), `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, appended with `result` for each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `index` will point to the position right after the last processed segment of the `data` list, `t` will be 0 as it has been decremented to zero, `p` will contain all integers from the specified segments of `data` concatenated together, `data` remains unchanged, `results` will be a list of all the results returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for res in results:

    #State: All iterations of the loop have finished, resulting in `results` being a list containing the return values from `func_1(n, p)` for every segment of integers extracted from `data`. The `index` variable points to the position immediately following the last segment of integers processed, `t` is 0, `p` contains all integers from the specified segments of `data` concatenated together, `data` remains unchanged, and `results` is a comprehensive list of all the results returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the hidden array and a sorted list of integers, then calls another function `func_1` to compute some result based on these inputs. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies internal variables like `index`, `t`, `p`, and `results` to manage the data across test cases.
