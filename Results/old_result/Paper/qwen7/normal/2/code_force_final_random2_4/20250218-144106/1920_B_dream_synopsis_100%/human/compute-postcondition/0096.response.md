To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **List `a`**: It is a reversed sorted list of integers. For example, if the original list was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `a` would be `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
2. **Variable `i`**: It is set to `k + 1`.
3. **Variable `sum1`**: It is the sum of all elements in `a`.
4. **List `ans`**: It contains `k + 1` elements. Each element is calculated based on specific conditions within the loop.

### Loop Logic:
- **Initialization**: `ans` is initialized with `k + 1` elements.
- **First Element Calculation**: 
  - If `i == 0`, the first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
  - Here, `x` is not explicitly defined, but it likely refers to the length of the list `a` or a specific index.
- **Subsequent Elements Calculation**:
  - For each iteration where `i + x - 1 < n`, each element in `ans` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
  - For each iteration where `i + x - 1 >= n`, each element in `ans` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

### Key Points:
- The exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, but they influence the calculation.
- The `max(ans)` function will return the maximum value among the elements in `ans`.

### Calculating `max(ans)`:
- Since `a` is a reversed sorted list, the sum of all elements (`sum1`) will be the largest when considering the first element of `ans`.
- The first element of `ans` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Given that `a` is reversed sorted, the sum of the first few elements will be subtracted twice, making this value smaller compared to the other elements.
- For subsequent elements, the formula involves adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Since `a` is reversed sorted, the subtraction term will be larger, making these values smaller than the first element unless `x` is very small.

Given these points, the maximum value in `ans` will be the first element because it is calculated without any subtractions that could reduce its value significantly.

### Conclusion:
Output: **sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])** (where `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a` and `x` is the length of the list `a` or a specific index, but the first element of `ans` is the largest due to the nature of the reversed sorted list and the calculation process).
