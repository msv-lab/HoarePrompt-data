You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `t` retains its initial value as an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive. After all iterations of the loop, `q` will be equal to `t - 1`. For each iteration of the loop, `ac` and `bc` are updated based on the counts of 'A' and 'B' characters in the string `s` provided during that iteration. The final output of the loop will consist of `t` lines, each line containing either 'A' or 'B', depending on whether the count of 'A' characters was greater than the count of 'B' characters in the respective string `s`. The variable `s` is not relevant to the final output state since it is redefined as an empty string at the start of each iteration.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop, the output will be a series of 'A' or 'B' characters, one per line, corresponding to the result of comparing the counts of 'A' and 'B' in each of the `t` strings processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each string in the test case, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' and prints the character that appears more frequently.

Let's break down the steps:

- The program initializes two counters `ac` and `bc` to zero.
- It then iterates through each character in the input string, incrementing the appropriate counter (`ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B').
- Finally, it compares the two counters and prints the character with the higher count.

Given the problem constraints and the example provided, this logic should work correctly for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, it is correct.

**Correctness: True**
