Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `v2` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

However, there is no explicit value given for `v1`. Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state and there's no way to infer its value from the given information, we cannot determine its exact value.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

We know that `{v2}` will be replaced with the value of `v2`, which is 2. Therefore, the part of the string that is explicitly defined will be `? [v1] [v1] 2 2`.

Since `v1` is undefined, the final output will include `[v1]` twice, where `[v1]` represents the unknown value of `v1`.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 2 2**
