Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is increased by `n // i`, `n` is decreased by `i * curr`**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` updates the value of `n` by subtracting `i * curr` from its current value. The other variables (`costs` and `h`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
