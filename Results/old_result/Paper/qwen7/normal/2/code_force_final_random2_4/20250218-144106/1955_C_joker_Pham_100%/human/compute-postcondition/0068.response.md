Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` remains \(n - 1\) or \(n - 2\) or remains unchanged, `sunks` is equal to `sunks + 1` or `sunks + 2` or `sunks + 3` or remains 0, 1, or 2, and the value of `a[r]` is less than the value of `a[l]` if the condition `a[r] < a[l]` is true, otherwise `r` remains unchanged and `sunks` changes accordingly, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. It indicates that regardless of whether `k == 0` is true or false, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain consistent with the specified conditions, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
