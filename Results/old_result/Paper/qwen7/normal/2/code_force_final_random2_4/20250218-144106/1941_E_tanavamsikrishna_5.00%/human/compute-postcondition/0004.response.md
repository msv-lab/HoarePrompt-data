Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

3. **Initial state of the variables**:
   - `total_costs` is an empty list.
   - `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0.
   - `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The loop will start with `i = 0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
   - Since `i` starts from 0, the smallest value `len(costs) - (k - 1)` can take is when `k = 1`, making the condition `i < len(costs)`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(costs)` for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being less than `len(costs)`.

**State:**
**`total_costs` is an empty list, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers (depths of the river cells), and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0; `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`; `i` must be less than `len(costs)`**
