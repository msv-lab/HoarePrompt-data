Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1, `i` is len(num) - 3, `tot` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `num`, `i`, and `tot`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
