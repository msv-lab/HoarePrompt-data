You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an input integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` strings, each consisting of exactly 5 characters ('A' or 'B'). For each string, it counts the number of 'A' characters and the number of 'B' or 'C' characters (since 'C' is not a valid character, it is treated as 'B'). It then prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters, and 'B' otherwise. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop that runs `t` times.

2. **String Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program reads a string `a` of length 5.
   - It initializes two counters `l` and `h` to zero. These counters will be used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.

3. **Character Counting**:
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `a`.
   - If the character is 'A', it increments the counter `l`.
   - If the character is 'B', it increments the counter `h`.

4. **Determine the Most Frequent Character**:
   - After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program compares `l` and `h`.
   - If `l` is greater than `h`, it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: "ABABB"
  - 'A' occurs 3 times.
  - 'B' occurs 2 times.
  - Since 3 > 2, the output is 'A'. (Incorrect according to the expected output)

- **Test Case 2**: "ABABA"
  - 'A' occurs 3 times.
  - 'B' occurs 2 times.
  - Since 3 > 2, the output is 'A'. (Incorrect according to the expected output)

- **Test Case 3**: "BBBAB"
  - 'A' occurs 1 time.
  - 'B' occurs 4 times.
  - Since 4 > 1, the output is 'B'. (Correct according to the expected output)

- **Test Case 4**: "AAAAA"
  - 'A' occurs 5 times.
  - 'B' occurs 0 times.
  - Since 5 > 0, the output is 'A'. (Correct according to the expected output)

- **Test Case 5**: "BBBBB"
  - 'A' occurs 0 times.
  - 'B' occurs 5 times.
  - Since 5 > 0, the output is 'B'. (Correct according to the expected output)

- **Test Case 6**: "BABAA"
  - 'A' occurs 3 times.
  - 'B' occurs 2 times.
  - Since 3 > 2, the output is 'A'. (Incorrect according to the expected output)

- **Test Case 7**: "AAAAB"
  - 'A' occurs 4 times.
  - 'B' occurs 1 time.
  - Since 4 > 1, the output is 'A'. (Correct according to the expected output)

- **Test Case 8**: "BAAAA"
  - 'A' occurs 4 times.
  - 'B' occurs 1 time.
  - Since 4 > 1, the output is 'A'. (Correct according to the expected output)

### Conclusion:

The program does not produce the correct output for all test cases. Specifically, it incorrectly identifies 'A' as the most frequent character when 'B' is more frequent in some cases.
