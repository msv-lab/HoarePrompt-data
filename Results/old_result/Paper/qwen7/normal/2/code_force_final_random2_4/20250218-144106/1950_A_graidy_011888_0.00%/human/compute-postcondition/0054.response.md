Output State: **`i` must be less than or equal to 1000, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is set to 'none', `x` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9.**

The code `res = 'none'` sets the variable `res` to the string `'none'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
