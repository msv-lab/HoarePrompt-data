Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(k - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_end + 1`. This means that `i` was `i_end` at the start of the previous iteration.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k - 1`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 2`.

5. **Consider the Modulo Operation**: The problem mentions that `ans` and `t` are taken modulo `MOD`. However, since these variables are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop. The variable `k` remains the same as before.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is `ans` modulo `MOD`, `t` is `t % MOD`, `i` is `i_end + 2`, and `k` is the same as before**.
