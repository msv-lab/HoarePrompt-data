Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` converts the first and second elements of the list `l1` into integers and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This means that `l1` remains unchanged, but now `n` and `k` hold integer values. Additionally, since the number of iterations left was calculated as `int(input()) - 1` before this line of code, after executing this line, the number of iterations left would be reduced by 1, making it `int(input()) - 2`.
