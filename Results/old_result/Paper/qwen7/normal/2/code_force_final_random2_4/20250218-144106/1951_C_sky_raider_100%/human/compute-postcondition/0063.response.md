Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`.
   - `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`.
   - `t` is increased by `s`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `n`, we need to update these values.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `n` was greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as long as it is still greater than 0.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now `i_prev + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Given the above reasoning, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `t` is increased by `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.
