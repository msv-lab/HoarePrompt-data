Postcondition: `nodes` is a dictionary, `key` is the next key in the `nodes` dictionary, and `leaves` is a list with an additional element `key`. If the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, then `key` is added to the `leaves` list. If the length of `nodes[key]` is not 1, then `key` is not added to the `leaves` list.
