Output State: **`num` is 0, `no` is a list containing `a` or is empty, `less` is a list containing `a` or is empty, `big` is a list containing `a`, `no` remains empty, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is the integer value of the first input, `a` is the integer value of the second input.**

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `a` is appended to `big`, the updated state of `big` is a list containing `a`.
