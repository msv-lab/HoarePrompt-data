Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `a` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`.**

Explanation: The line `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. Since the previous value of `bx` is not specified, it remains as a variable that now holds the maximum value between `x` and its previous value. All other variables (`n`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
