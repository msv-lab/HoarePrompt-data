Output State: **`prev` is equal to `x`, `x` is the second element of the list `odds`, `idx` is decremented by 1, `prev` is now equal to `x` after the assignment.**

Explanation: The code decrements `idx` by 1, but since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `idx`, we only know that `idx` is decremented. The values of `prev` and `x` remain unchanged except for the assignment of `x` to `prev`.
