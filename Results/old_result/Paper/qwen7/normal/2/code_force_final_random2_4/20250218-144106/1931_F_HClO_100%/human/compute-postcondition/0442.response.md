Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions
- `idx1` is `n - 2`
- `idx2` is `n - 2`
- `val` is an empty list
- `m` equals 2
- `idx1` is not less than `idx2` with `idx1` being less than or equal to `idx2`

The print statement is simply `print('yes')`.

Since the print statement is directly printing a string, the output will be exactly as specified.

Output: **yes**
