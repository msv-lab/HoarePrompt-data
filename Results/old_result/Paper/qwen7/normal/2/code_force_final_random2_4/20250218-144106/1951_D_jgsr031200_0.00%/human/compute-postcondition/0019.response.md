Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is increased by `2n`, `n` is decreased by `i * curr`, `i` is 1, `curr` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `n` is decreased by `curr * i`. Since `i` is 1 and `curr` is `n`, `n` is decreased by `n`.
- The values of `costs`, `h`, and `curr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- `h` is increased by `n` twice (once in the initial state and once in the given code), so `h` is increased by `2n`.
- The updated value of `n` is `n - n = 0`.

Therefore, the final state includes the updated values of `n` and `h`, while `costs`, `i`, and `curr` retain their initial values.
