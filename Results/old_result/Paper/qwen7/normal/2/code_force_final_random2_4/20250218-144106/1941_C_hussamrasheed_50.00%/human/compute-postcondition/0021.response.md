Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- `n` is an input integer (its value is unknown but it does not affect the print statement).
- `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`.
- `p` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s` after removing all occurrences of 'map'.
- `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed.

The print statement is `print(m + p)`, which adds the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string (`m`) to the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated string (`p`).

Since `m` and `p` are the counts of specific substrings in the string `s` after modifications, their values are determined by the content of `s`.

Output: **m + p (where m is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original string s, and p is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated string s after removing all occurrences of 'map')**
