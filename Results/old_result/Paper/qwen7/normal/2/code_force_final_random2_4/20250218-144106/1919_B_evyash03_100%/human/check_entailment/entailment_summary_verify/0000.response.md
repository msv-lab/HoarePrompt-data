Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into subarrays.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The function `func_1` should return the minimum possible penalty.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' characters in the input string `expression`.
   - It then calculates the number of '-' characters as the difference between the length of the string and the count of '+' characters.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute difference between these two counts.

3. **Analysis of the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the string and its length.
   - The function `func_1` does not actually perform any optimal splitting of the array `a` into subarrays.
   - Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns their absolute difference multiplied by the length of the string minus the count of '+' characters.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     5
     -----
     ```
     - The string is `"-----"`.
     - The length is 5.
     - The function `func_1` counts 0 '+' characters and 5 '-' characters.
     - It returns `abs(0 - 5) * (5 - 0) = 5 * 5 = 25`.

   - This result is clearly incorrect because the optimal split would be `([-1, -1, -1, -1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of 5.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty.
   - It simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns a value that does not reflect the optimal solution.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

Final: **False**
