Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans1` now contains the element at index 2 of list `l`; `len(l)` must be at least 2; `ans2` now contains the element at index 2 of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 2) of list `l` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 2, `ans2.append(l[2])` adds `l[2]` to `ans2`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
