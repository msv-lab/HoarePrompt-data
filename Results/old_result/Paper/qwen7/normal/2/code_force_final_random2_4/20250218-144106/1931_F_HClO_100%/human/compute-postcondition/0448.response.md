Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, `m` equals 2, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` with `idx1` being less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers, `l1` has had its element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the index `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
