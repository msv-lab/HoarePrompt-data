Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The program attempts to count the number of increasing pairs in a specific way but does not fully account for splitting the array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) to minimize the penalty. The logic inside the loops is flawed and does not ensure that the array is optimally split.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program tries to identify the first increasing pair and then increments a counter `c` based on certain conditions. However, this approach does not guarantee that the array is split optimally.
   - The variables `a` and `b` are used in a way that doesn't reflect the optimal split of the array into two subsequences.

3. **Missing Key Steps**:
   - The program does not handle the full logic required to split the array into two subsequences such that the penalty \(p(s) + p(t)\) is minimized.
   - It lacks the necessary logic to consider all possible splits and choose the one with the minimum penalty.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly involving sorting or dynamic programming techniques to ensure the optimal split of the array into two subsequences.
