Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer and decreased by the number of iterations, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `m * p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `2 - m`, and the input integer for the loop is still greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial conditions for `a`, `b`, `s`, and the relationship between `a` and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `a` is decreased by the number of iterations, but since the number of iterations is not specified, we keep it in terms of the condition.
