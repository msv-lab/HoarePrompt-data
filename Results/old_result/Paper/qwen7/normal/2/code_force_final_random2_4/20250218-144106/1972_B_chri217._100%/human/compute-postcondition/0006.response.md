Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. The variables in the loop head are `t`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the first line of input from stdin with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs `t` times, at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `t` should be `t - 1`.

5. **List the adjusted states**:
   - `cases` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `t` is now `t - 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the first line of input from stdin with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `t` is `t - 1`**
