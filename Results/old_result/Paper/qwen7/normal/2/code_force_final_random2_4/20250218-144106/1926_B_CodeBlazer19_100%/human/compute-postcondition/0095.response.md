Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, then `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `j` and `n`, we need to update these values.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless it is modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `j` will be updated to `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given the current state:
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or an unchanged value (if `s` does not contain exactly one '1').
- `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an unchanged value (if the count of '1' in `s` is not greater than 1).

For the next iteration:
- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or unchanged, `b` is either 'SQUARE' or unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**.
