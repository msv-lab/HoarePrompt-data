Output State: **`d.get(i)` is either 1 or incremented by 1, `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`. `pl` now includes `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and `d.get(i)` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1 based on its initial value (either `None` or an existing value), the output state reflects these changes. The value of `i` remains the same as the next element in `palka` after `i_val`.
