Let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the current state before the loop:

The loop condition is:
```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, meaning `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median` at the start of the loop.

Current state before the loop:
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is incremented multiple times
- `total` remains 0
- `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`
- `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`
- `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median`
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `b` is a sorted version of list `a`
- `new_median` is assigned the value of `median`

Since the loop condition is `new_median <= median`, for the loop to execute at least once, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.

Given the current state, `new_median` is initially set to be greater than `median` (as per the description), so it should already satisfy the loop condition. However, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing based on the given conditions.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the states of the objects in the loop head since `new_median` is already set to be greater than `median` and the loop will execute as intended.

State: **`total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is incremented multiple times, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b` and is greater than `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `b` is a sorted version of list `a`.**
