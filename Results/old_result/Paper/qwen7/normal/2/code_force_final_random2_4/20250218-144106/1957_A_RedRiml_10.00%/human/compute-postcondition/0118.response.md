Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers, `d.get(i)` is either 1 (if `d.get(i)` was initially None) or incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` was not None), and `i` is now in `pl`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` was not previously in `pl`, it is added to the list. The values of `palka` and `d.get(i)` remain unchanged in terms of their postconditions, but the presence of `i` in `pl` is now updated.
