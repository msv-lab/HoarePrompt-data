Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(n - k, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`:**
   At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - k - 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range `n - k` to `n - 1`.

4. **Update the Value of `i`:**
   Since `i` starts at `n - k - 1` and the loop increments `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n - k - 1 + 1 = n - k`.

5. **Check the Range Condition:**
   The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `n - k` to `n - 1`. Given that `i` is updated to `n - k`, it is within the valid range.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` is updated to `n - k`.
   - The other variables (`soma_b`, `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `pref`, and `resultado`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`soma_b` is now `soma_b + lista_B[i] + lista_B[i]`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `n - k`, `resultado` is the minimum of `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`**.
