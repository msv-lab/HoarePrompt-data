Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values of the input split into integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, and `ans` will contain `k + 2` elements, each being the value of `sums` after each iteration from 0 to `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state of `i` is `k + 1`, and `sums` and `ans` are described as they will be updated based on the conditions within the loop. Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are not specified, they remain as placeholders for their respective input values.
