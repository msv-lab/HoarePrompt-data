### Reasoning

Let's re-examine the program and the logic step-by-step to identify any issues.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - It initializes `t` with the value of `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `b` is odd, it increments `t` by 1 to ensure enough space for all 2x2 icons. This is because a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and if `b` is odd, one extra screen might be needed.
   - `t` is then adjusted to account for the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons: `t = t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Checking Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - `t1` calculates the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), then the current `t` is sufficient.
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons: `t2 = a - t1`.
   - `t` is updated to include these additional screens:
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t += t2 // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `t += t2 // 15 + 1`.

4. **Outputting Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `t`, which represents the minimum number of screens needed.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Calculation of Remaining Space (`t1`):**
   - The formula `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` seems incorrect. The correct formula should be `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` but this doesn't account for the actual space left after placing 2x2 icons. Instead, it should be calculated based on the actual number of cells available after placing the 2x2 icons.

2. **Handling Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The logic for handling the remaining space for 1x1 icons is flawed. The calculation `t2 = a - t1` assumes that `t1` is the remaining space, but it isn't. The correct approach should be to calculate the actual remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into that space.

3. **Adjustment Logic:**
   - The adjustment logic for adding additional screens based on `t2` is also incorrect. The correct approach should be to directly calculate the number of additional screens needed based on the remaining space and the size of the 1x1 icons.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit in the grid.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space.
4. Calculate the total number of screens needed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit in the grid
        num_screens_for_2x2 = (b + 1) // 2
        # Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = num_screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit into the remaining space
        num_screens_for_1x1 = (a + remaining_space - 1) // 15
        # Total number of screens needed
        total_screens = num_screens_for_2x2 + num_screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)
```

### Final Evaluation

After reviewing the corrected logic and the provided examples, the original assessment was inaccurate due to the flawed logic in the calculation of remaining space and the adjustment for 1x1 icons.

**Final: False**
