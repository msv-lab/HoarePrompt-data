Postcondition: **`y` is either `n - 1 - i` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, or `0` otherwise. `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` with `rem` being `k % (i + 1)` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, or `a[i + 2]` if the condition is not met, and `k` is a non-zero integer.**
