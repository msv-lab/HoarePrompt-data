Based on the initial state provided:

- `op` is 0
- `num` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `total` is 0
- `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
- `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`
- `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, where `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`

The `print(16668)` statement directly prints the integer 16668 without referencing any of the other variables or objects.

Output: **16668**
