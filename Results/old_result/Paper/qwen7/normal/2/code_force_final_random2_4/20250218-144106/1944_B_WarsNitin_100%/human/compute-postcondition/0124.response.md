Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `k` is `-3`, `ans1` is updated by appending `l[i]`, `ans2` is updated by appending `l[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `-2` to `-3`. The values of `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `n-2`, `k` is now `-3`, and both `ans1` and `ans2` are updated by appending `l[i]`.
