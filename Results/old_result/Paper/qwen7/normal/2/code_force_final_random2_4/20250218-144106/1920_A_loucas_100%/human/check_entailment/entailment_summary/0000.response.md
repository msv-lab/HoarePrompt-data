Reasoning:
1. The program correctly categorizes the constraints into three lists: `big`, `less`, and `no`.
2. It calculates the potential range of values for `k` by finding the difference between the minimum value in the `less` list and the maximum value in the `big` list.
3. This initial range is then adjusted by subtracting one for each value in the `no` list that falls within this range.
4. The logic handles the case where the range is empty (i.e., when `min(less) - max(big) < 1`) by printing `0`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem. It correctly identifies the range of possible values for `k` and adjusts for any excluded values.

Correctness: **True**
