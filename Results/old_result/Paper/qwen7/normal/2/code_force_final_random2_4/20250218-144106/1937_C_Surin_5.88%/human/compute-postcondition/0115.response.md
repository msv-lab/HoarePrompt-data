Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is an integer greater than 4.
- `r` is an input string.
- `prev` remains unchanged and is still 0 unless the character `>` was entered for any `i` from 1 to `n-1`, in which case `prev` would be set to the last `i` where `>` was entered.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Since `i` is equal to `n`, it means that the loop or condition checking for `>` has already been completed.
2. If `>` was entered for any `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `prev` would have been set to the last `i` where `>` was entered. However, since `i` is now `n`, this means that `>` was not entered for any `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
3. Therefore, `prev` remains 0.
4. The variable `v1` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is unknown and cannot be determined from the given information.

Given these points, the print statement will output:
Output: **! 0 v1**
