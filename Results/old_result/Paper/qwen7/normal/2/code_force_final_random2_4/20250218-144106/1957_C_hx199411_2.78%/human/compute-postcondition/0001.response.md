The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), inclusive, and it is set to the integer input received. Since `t` is guaranteed to be a non-zero integer (as it is within the specified range), no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), inclusive, and it is set to the integer input received**
