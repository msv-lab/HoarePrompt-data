Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `a1` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `a2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**

In this step, the variable `idx1` is assigned the value of `i`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not checked or affected by this line of code.
