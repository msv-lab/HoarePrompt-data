#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of integers where each element represents the magic power of a mushroom, and p is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns a function named 'decorating_function'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns another function named `decorating_function`. This returned function is designed to modify the behavior of a recursive `repr` call by returning `fillvalue` instead of performing the default recursive action.
