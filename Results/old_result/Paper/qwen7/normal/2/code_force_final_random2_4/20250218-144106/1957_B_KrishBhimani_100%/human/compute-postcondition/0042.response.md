Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer**.

This means that the initial list `l1` remains unchanged, but now `n` holds the first element of `l1` as an integer, and `k` holds the second element of `l1` as an integer.
