Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are inputs provided through `input()`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the last integer input converted to an integer, and `k` is the second last integer input converted to an integer. For each iteration, the condition `n - k <= 1` was either true or false, leading to either printing `n` or `1`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is still within the range of 1 to 1000, `n` is the last value read for `n` from the input, and `k` is the second last value read for `k` from the input.
