Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `t` is `max(0, t)`, `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with one less element, `s` is the sum of all remaining elements in list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `tmp`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
