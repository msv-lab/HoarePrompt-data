You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the final value of `t` will be determined based on the last iteration's conditions. Specifically, `t` will be updated according to the logic inside the loop. If `t1 >= a` in the last iteration, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, or `t + t2 // 15` otherwise, where `t2 = a - t1`. The value of `n` will be decremented to 0 after the loop completes, and `i` will be equal to `n`. The values of `a` and `b` will be the last values provided by the user during the loop iterations. The variable `t1` will be the result of the last calculation, which is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
    #
    #In summary, `t` will reflect the cumulative effect of all iterations, with the final update being based on the comparison between `t1` and `a` in the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Let's consider a specific case to demonstrate this:

For the input `x = 12` and `y = 4`, the expected output is `2`. However, the program fails to handle this case correctly.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. It calculates `t` as the number of 2x2 icons divided by 2, rounding up if necessary.
2. It then calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
3. It checks if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` and updates `t` accordingly.
4. Finally, it calculates the total number of screens needed.

However, this logic does not correctly account for the placement of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the calculation of `t1` and the subsequent logic do not ensure that the remaining 1x1 icons are placed optimally.

To illustrate, let's manually calculate the correct number of screens needed for `x = 12` and `y = 4`:

- We need 4 screens for the 2x2 icons (since 4 * 4 = 16 cells, which is more than enough for 4 icons).
- After placing the 2x2 icons, we have 15 cells left per screen.
- We need to place 12 1x1 icons, which can be placed in 12 / 15 = 1 full screen with 3 cells left over.

Thus, the total number of screens needed is 4 (for 2x2 icons) + 1 (for 1x1 icons) = 5.

The program, however, does not correctly account for this and may produce incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
