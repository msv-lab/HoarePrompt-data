Postcondition: `cx` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` remains increased by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains increased by 1 as well since there is no else part changing its value.
