Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list with at least one element containing the first element of `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` (the first element of `palka`) is not already in `pl`, then `pl` now contains `i` appended to it. Additionally, if `d.get(i)` returns `1`, then `d[i]` remains `1`; otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by `1`.
