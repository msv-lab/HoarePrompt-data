Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `t` is the number of test cases such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers where each element is (i + 1) for every index i where `s1[i]` == '>', `totalOne` is the length of the list `pre`, `preOne` is a list obtained by taking the prefix sum of the list `pre` with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = [0] * n` initializes a list `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`. Therefore, these variables retain their original states.
