Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` is greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code simply calls the function `func_1()`. Since no variables are assigned new values or modified within the given code snippet, the initial state remains unchanged. The value of `t` and the fact that `func_1()` has been called are preserved.
