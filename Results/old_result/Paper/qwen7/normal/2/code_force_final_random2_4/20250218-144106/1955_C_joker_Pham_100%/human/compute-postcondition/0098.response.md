Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15} - 2 \cdot a[r]\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` remains unchanged, `sunks` is increased by 1, and `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= a[r]` subtracts the value of `a[r]` from `a[l]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a[l]` is updated to its new value, which is the original value of `a[l]` minus `a[r]`.
