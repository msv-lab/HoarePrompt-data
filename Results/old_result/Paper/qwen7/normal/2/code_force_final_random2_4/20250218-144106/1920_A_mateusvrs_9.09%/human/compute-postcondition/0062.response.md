Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ax` is the smallest value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest value among all `x` where `a` was 1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is increased by the total number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**

Explanation: The line `cx = set()` initializes `cx` as an empty set. This operation does not affect the values of `ax`, `bx`, `r`, `tmp`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The only change is that `cx` is now an empty set.
