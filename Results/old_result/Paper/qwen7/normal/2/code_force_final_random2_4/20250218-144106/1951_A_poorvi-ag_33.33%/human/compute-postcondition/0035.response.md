Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no' and 'no' appended, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('no')` appends the string 'no' to the list `results`. Since `results` initially contained 'no', after appending another 'no', it now contains ['no', 'no']. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
