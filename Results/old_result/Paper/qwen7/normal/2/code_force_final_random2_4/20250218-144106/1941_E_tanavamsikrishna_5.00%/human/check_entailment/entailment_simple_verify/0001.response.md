### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program implements the solution to the problem as described. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to confirm the accuracy of the assessment:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes a single row to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports under the given constraints.
   - The logic for updating the cost of placing a support at each position is correct:
     - For positions less than `d-1`, it simply increments the depth by 1.
     - For positions greater than or equal to `d-1`, it calculates the minimum cost by considering the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells plus the current depth plus 1.
   - The final return statement correctly returns the total cost for that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` for each test case.
   - It then reads `n` rows of depths and processes each row using `func_1`.
   - It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost among these sets.
   - The use of slicing (`costs[i:i + k]`) to get the cost of `k` consecutive rows and then summing them up is appropriate.
   - The final step of finding the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows is correct.

The annotated code provides clear insights into the state of the program at key points, validating the correctness of the logic in both functions. The program correctly handles the constraints and computes the minimum cost as required.

### Final Evaluation

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of the logic in both functions, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
