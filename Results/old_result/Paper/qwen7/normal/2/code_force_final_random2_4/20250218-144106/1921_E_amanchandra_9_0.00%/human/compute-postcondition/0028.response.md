Output State: **`i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`**.

This means that the variable `l` is assigned the value of the maximum between 1 and `ya - x`. The values of `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
