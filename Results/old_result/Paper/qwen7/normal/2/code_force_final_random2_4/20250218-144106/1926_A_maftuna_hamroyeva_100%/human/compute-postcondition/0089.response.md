Functionality: **The function processes an input integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` strings, each consisting of exactly 5 characters ('A' or 'B'). For each string, it counts the number of 'A' characters and the number of 'B' or 'C' characters (since 'C' is not a valid character, it is treated as 'B'). It then prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters, and 'B' otherwise. The function does not return any value.**
