Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic for the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Balance Calculation and Details Collection**: The program iterates through the input string `s` and calculates the balance at each position. It stores the balance, the negative of the position (to ensure the highest positions are sorted last in case of ties), and the character itself in a list `details`.

2. **Sorting**: The `details` list is then sorted based on the balance values. If there are ties in balance, the negative position ensures that higher positions come first, which is crucial for maintaining the correct order during the shuffle.

3. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the final balanced shuffle sequence by joining the characters from the sorted list.

Given these steps, the program accurately performs the required balanced shuffle operation and produces the correct output for any valid balanced parentheses sequence as per the problem constraints.
