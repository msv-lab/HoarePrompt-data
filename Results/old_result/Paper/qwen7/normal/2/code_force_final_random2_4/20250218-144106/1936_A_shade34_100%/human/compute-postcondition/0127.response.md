Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing 0, `s` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `mak`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
