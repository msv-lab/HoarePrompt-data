To determine what will be printed, let's break down the information given:

- There is a variable `r` mentioned in the print statement.
- No explicit value or further definition of `r` is provided in the initial state.

Given this, we cannot determine the exact value of `r`. Therefore, the print statement will simply output the value of `r` as it is currently defined.

Output: **r**
