You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))

            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0

        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
    print(resultado)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and two lists \(a\) and \(b\). It then calls `func_1()` exactly `numero_testes` times, where `numero_testes` is initially read from input and must be between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. After processing all test cases, `numero_testes` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1,000 inclusive, but it will always be greater than 2. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
- We need to help Kirill minimize the cost to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people.
- For each position `i`, we have two costs: `a_i` (cost to move from position `j` to `i` where `j < i`) and `b_i` (additional cost for each position `k` between `j` and `i`).

### Key Points to Check
1. **Cost Calculation**: Ensure the logic correctly calculates the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions.
2. **Reverse Lists**: The use of reversed lists might be unnecessary and could lead to errors.
3. **Cost Accumulation**: Verify how costs are accumulated and compared.
4. **Edge Cases**: Ensure the program handles edge cases properly, such as when `m == n`.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It takes `n` and `k` as inputs.
   - Reads `a_i` and `b_i` values.
   - Reverses both lists, which is unnecessary since the problem doesn't specify any reverse operations.
   - Initializes `soma_b` and `pref`.
   - Iterates through the first `n - k` elements to calculate the prefix sum of `b_i` and compare it with `a_i`.
   - Uses a nested loop to find the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the last `k` positions.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Takes the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()`.

### Issues Identified
1. **Reversing Lists**: The reversal of lists is unnecessary and can lead to confusion. The original order of the lists should be used.
2. **Cost Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost seems correct but could be simplified.
3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the case where `m == n` explicitly.

### Simplified and Corrected Version
Here is a corrected version of the function without unnecessary reversals:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize variables
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    resultado = float('inf')
    
    # Calculate the cost to move to the first k positions
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to move to the last k positions
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
    
    print(resultado)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Call the main function
func_2()
```

### Conclusion
After reviewing the code and making necessary corrections, the logic appears to be correct. The program now correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions without unnecessary reversals.
