Output State: **`final` is now ['n'], `mini` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `c1` is 10.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `c1` is defined as `o * 100 // n` and given that `c1` is less than 50, we can infer that `c1` is 10 (assuming `o` and `n` are such that this condition holds true). The values of `mini` and `pk` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
