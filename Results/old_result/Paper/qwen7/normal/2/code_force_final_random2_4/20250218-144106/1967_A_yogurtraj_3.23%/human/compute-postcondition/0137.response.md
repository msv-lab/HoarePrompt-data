Given the initial state where all iterations have completed and the final state of the variables is such that `k` is equal to 0, and all other variables retain their values from the precondition, let's break down the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.

- `k` is 0, but since `k` is not used in the expression, it does not affect the calculation.
- `r`, `n`, `rem`, and `y` retain their values from the precondition.

The expression simplifies to:

\[
(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y
\]

Without specific values for `r`, `n`, `rem`, and `y`, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y**
