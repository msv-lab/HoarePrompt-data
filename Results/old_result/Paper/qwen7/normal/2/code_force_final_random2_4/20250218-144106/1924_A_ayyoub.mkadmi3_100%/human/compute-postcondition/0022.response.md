Output State: **`i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` contains characters from `s` that are in the `alphabet` plus the character `i`, `s` remains a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k-1` lowercase English alphabets, `s2` is `s2` plus the character `i`.**

Explanation: The code removes the character `i` from the set `alphabet`. Since `i` was the next character in `s` and was part of `s1`, `s2`, and `alphabet`, removing `i` from `alphabet` means that `alphabet` now contains the first `k-1` lowercase English alphabets if `len(alphabet)` was previously `1`, otherwise it still contains the first `k-1` lowercase English alphabets. The values of `i`, `s`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged except that `i` is no longer in `alphabet`.
