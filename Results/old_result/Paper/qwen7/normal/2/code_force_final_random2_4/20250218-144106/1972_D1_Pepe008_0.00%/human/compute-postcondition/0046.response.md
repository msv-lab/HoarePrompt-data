Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` remains as 1 after the loop.
- `T` remains as the initial positive integer.
- `info` remains as the list of strings split from the input.
- `a` remains as the first element of `info` converted to an integer.
- `b` remains as the second element of `info` converted to an integer.
- `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

The key point here is the calculation of `suma`. Since `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations under the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, and without knowing the exact values of `a` and the range of `i`, we cannot determine the exact value of `suma`. However, we know that `suma` is derived from the loop and the condition mentioned.

Given this, the print statement will output `suma - 1`.

Output: **suma - 1 (where suma is the sum of all x values calculated during the loop iterations under the condition a - i * (i - 1) > 0)**
