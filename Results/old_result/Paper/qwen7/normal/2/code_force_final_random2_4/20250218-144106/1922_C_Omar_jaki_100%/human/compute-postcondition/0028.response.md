Postcondition: `b` is a list with its length equal to the length of `a` plus one, starting with the initial value of -1000000000.0, followed by a series of values calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `c` is the value returned by `r()`, `d` is the value returned by `r()`, and `u` is a value that is 1 less than the original value returned from `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` remains lower than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
