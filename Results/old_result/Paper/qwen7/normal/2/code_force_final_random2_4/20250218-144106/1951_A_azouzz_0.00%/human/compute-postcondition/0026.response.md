Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the value of the input string, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. **If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, `cnt1` is greater than 2 and odd, or `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or odd.**
