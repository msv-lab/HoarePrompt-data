Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    path = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(path))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0; `index` is increased by 2; `path` is the value of `data[index]`; `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 16, `path` is the value of `data[index]`, `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `index` is increased by 34, `path` is now `data[index]`, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the return value of `func_1(data[index])`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `n` is an integer




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
