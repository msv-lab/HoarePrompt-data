Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`: Since `mak` is defined as `n`, it follows that `mak2` is also `n`.
   - `n` is greater than 1: This means `n` is any integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n-2`: Given that `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be an integer that is `n-2`.
   - `mak` is `n`: As mentioned, `mak` is directly assigned the value of `n`.
   - `pans` is a list containing the element `n-1`: This list contains only one element, which is `n-1`.
   - `s` is a string input from the user: The value of `s` is unknown since it depends on user input.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`
   - We know that `mak` and `mak2` both have the value of `n`.
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `mak2` is also `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the following:
- A question mark (`?`)
- The value of `mak`, which is `n`
- The value of `mak2`, which is `n`
- The value of `i`, which is `n-2`
- The value of `mak2`, which is `n`

Putting this together, the output will be:
Output: **'? n n n-2 n'**
