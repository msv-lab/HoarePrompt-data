Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s` plus 1, and `s[right]` must not be '0'**.

Explanation: The variable `right` was incremented by 1, changing its value from the original length of the list `s` to the new length of the list `s` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
