Output State: **`k` is an integer, `r` is undefined, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `m` is the input value, `n` is the integer input from the second line, `k` is the integer input from the second line, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `a`. The values of `k`, `r`, `ii`, `m`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
