Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `idx1` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `idx1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1 according to the initial state. The conditions involving `n` and the break statement remain unchanged since the code does not affect `n` or the break condition. Therefore, `n` is still greater than or equal to 1, and the break condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` remains as a potential future condition but is not evaluated here.
