Output State: **`numCuts` is 0; `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The function `dfs(1, 1)` is called and its result is assigned to the variable `leftover`. The value of `numCuts` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `leftover` and the unchanged value of `numCuts`.
