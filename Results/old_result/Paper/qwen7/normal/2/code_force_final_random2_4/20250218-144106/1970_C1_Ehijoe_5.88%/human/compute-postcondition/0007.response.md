Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; `tree` contains the elements `u` and `v`.**

The code `tree.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the list `tree`, which previously contained the element `u`. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
