Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game between Sasha and Anna where they manipulate a list of integers according to specific rules. The goal is to determine the winner based on the final state of the list.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - **Function `zerocnts(num)`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer. This is used to sort the numbers in `nums` based on their trailing zeros.
   - **Function `func_1(n, m, nums)`**: This function determines the winner based on the total length of the numbers in the list (`tot`) and the parameter `m`.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: `tot` is initialized as the total length of the numbers in the list.
   - **Sorting and Iteration**: The numbers are sorted based on the number of trailing zeros in descending order. The loop then iteratively subtracts the number of trailing zeros of every second element in the sorted list from `tot`.
   - **Winning Condition**: The function checks if `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the strategy to determine the winner based on the total length of the numbers and the parameter `m`.
   - The sorting and iteration ensure that the most significant contributions to the total length are handled first.
   - The condition `tot >= m + 1` accurately reflects the winning condition for Sasha.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
