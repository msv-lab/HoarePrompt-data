Output State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`**.

This means that the value of `sum_f` has been updated to be the original value of `sum_f` plus the value of `f`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged.
