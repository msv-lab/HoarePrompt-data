Output State: **`i` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, and `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string `line` and converting each part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` splits the input string `line` into parts using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `T`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
