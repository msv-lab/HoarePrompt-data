Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` remains \(n - 1\) or \(n - 2\) or remains unchanged, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If \(k \geq a[r]\), then `t` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If \(k < a[r]\), then no changes occur to `t`, `r`, and `sunks` remains unchanged.**

This means that after executing the `break` statement, the following conditions hold true:
- `l` is incremented by 1.
- `sunks` is increased by 1.
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If \(k \geq a[r]\), then `t` and `r` remain unchanged.
- If \(k < a[r]\), then `t`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.
