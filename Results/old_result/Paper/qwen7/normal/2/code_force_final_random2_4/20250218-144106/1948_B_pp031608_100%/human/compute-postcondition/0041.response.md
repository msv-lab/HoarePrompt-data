Output State: **`ans` is False, `m` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` is decremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input().**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The original values of `ans`, `m`, `i`, and `n` are unchanged, but now `arr` contains the list of integers from the input.
