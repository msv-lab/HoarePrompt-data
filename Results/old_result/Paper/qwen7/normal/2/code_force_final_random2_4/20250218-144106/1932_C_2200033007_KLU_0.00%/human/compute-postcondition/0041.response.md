Output State: **The program returns a reversed list `ans` containing the cumulative product of all elements in the original list `b`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first.**

Given the initial state:
- `b` is an empty list.
- `p` is the product of all elements in the original list `b` (which is 1 since `b` is empty).
- `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, starting from the last element (which is also an empty list since `b` is empty).

Since `b` is empty, there are no elements to process, and thus `ans` remains an empty list. Therefore, when the function returns `reversed(ans)`, it returns an empty list.
