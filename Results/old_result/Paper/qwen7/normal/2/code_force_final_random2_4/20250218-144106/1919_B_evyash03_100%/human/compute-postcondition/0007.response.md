Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `char` and `expression`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `expression`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is 1.
   - `expression` is a non-empty string of length `length`.
   - `char` is the first character in `expression` and equals '+'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `char` is the first character in `expression` and it equals '+', the loop will continue if there are more characters in `expression`.
   - For the next iteration, `char` will be the second character in `expression`.
   - `expression` will now be the remaining part of the string after removing the first character.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `count` remains 1 because the condition for incrementing `count` (which was checking `char == '+'`) has already been met.
   - `expression` is now the substring of the original `expression` starting from the second character.
   - `char` is the second character in the new `expression`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`count` is 1, `expression` is a non-empty string of length `length-1`, `char` is the second character in `expression`**.
