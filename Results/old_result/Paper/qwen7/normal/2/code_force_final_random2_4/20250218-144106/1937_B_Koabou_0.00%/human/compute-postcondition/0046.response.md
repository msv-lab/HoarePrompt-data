Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `x`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `x` must be greater than 0
   - `s` is 'aa2'
   - `t` is 2

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The condition `i < x` must still hold true. Since `x` must be greater than 0, and `i` is now 4, `x` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is 4 and `x` must be greater than 4.

**State: **`i` is 4, `x` must be greater than 4**
