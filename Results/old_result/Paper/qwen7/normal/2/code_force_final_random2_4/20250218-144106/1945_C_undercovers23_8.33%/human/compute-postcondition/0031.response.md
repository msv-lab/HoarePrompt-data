Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 2, otherwise `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 50**

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1, so if the first character of `s` was '0', `zero` changes from 1 to 2. If the first character of `s` was not '0', `one` remains 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged.
