Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `sums` as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Here, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, and `a[:x]` refers to the first `x` elements of the list `a`. Since the value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `sums`. However, we know that `sums` is calculated using the formula provided. All other variables remain unchanged.
