Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` must be greater than the input integer.
   - `a` is a list where:
     - The first element `a[0]` is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])`.
     - Every subsequent element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-2`) is `a[j-1] - T[j-1]`.
   - The list `a` is reversed.
   - `result` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `a` with spaces.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the construction of the list `a` and then the resulting `result`.

### Construction of List `a`:
- Let's denote the sum of `T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]` as `S`.
- Therefore, `a[0] = 1000 - S`.

For each subsequent element `a[j]` (where `j` ranges from 1 to `n-2`):
- `a[j] = a[j-1] - T[j-1]`.

Given that `a` is reversed after this construction, the actual order of elements in `a` will be the reverse of the order constructed above.

### Result String `result`:
- `result` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `a` with spaces.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 4` and `T = [10, 20, 30]` for simplicity:
- `S = 10 + 20 = 30`.
- `a[0] = 1000 - 30 = 970`.
- `a[1] = a[0] - T[0] = 970 - 10 = 960`.
- `a[2] = a[1] - T[1] = 960 - 20 = 940`.

After reversing `a`, the list becomes `[940, 960, 970]`.

Thus, `result` would be `"940 960 970"`.

### General Case:
- The exact values of `T` are not specified, but the construction of `a` follows the same pattern.
- The final `result` will be a space-separated string of the elements of the reversed list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **"940 960 970" (where the exact numbers depend on the specific values of T, but the structure is as described)**
