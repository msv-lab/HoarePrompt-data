Output State: `cnt` is [2], `ans` is 3.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute until `cnt` is no longer a list with more than one element. Given the initial state and the operations within the loop, we can see that the loop reduces the elements in `cnt` by 1 each iteration. After the third iteration, `cnt` becomes [2]. The loop will continue to run as long as `cnt` has more than one element. Since `[2]` has only one element, it does not meet the condition to enter the loop again. Therefore, the loop stops here. The value of `ans` increases by 1 for each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `ans` is 3.
