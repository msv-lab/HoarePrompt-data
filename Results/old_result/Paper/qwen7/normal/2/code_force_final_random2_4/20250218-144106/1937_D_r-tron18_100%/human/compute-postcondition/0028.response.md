Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[i]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

This means that the values of `el` and `suffZero` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variables `ol` and `zr` have been assigned new values: `ol` is set to `totalOne`, and `zr` is set to the length of the list `suffZero` minus one.
