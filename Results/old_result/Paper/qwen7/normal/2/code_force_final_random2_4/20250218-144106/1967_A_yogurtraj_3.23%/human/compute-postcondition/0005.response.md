Output State: **`ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is equal to the first element of list `a`, `rem` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `rem` to 0. The values of `ii`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
