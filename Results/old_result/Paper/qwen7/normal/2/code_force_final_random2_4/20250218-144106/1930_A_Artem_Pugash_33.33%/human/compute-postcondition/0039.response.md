Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is the final iteration count, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of `min(a, b)` for each pair of elements that were popped from `numbers`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `numbers` will be an empty list since every element was popped out. The variable `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is determined by the length of the original `numbers` list. The variable `suma` will hold the cumulative sum of the minimum values of each pair of elements that were popped from `numbers`.
