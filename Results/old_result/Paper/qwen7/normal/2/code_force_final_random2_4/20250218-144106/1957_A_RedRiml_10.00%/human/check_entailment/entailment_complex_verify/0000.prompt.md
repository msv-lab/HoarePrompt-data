You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list of stick lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n consists of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: Output State: `shapes` is equal to the number of unique elements in `palka` whose count in `d` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is a dictionary where each key from the list `palka` is mapped to its count in `palka`, and `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `shapes` will be equal to the number of unique elements in `palka` whose count in the dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3. The dictionary `d` will hold the counts of each key from the list `palka`, and the list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, as no modifications are made to `pl` within the loop body other than appending new unique elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `w` representing the number of test cases, followed by `w` sets of inputs. Each set includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths. It then calculates and prints the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times in the input list for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed. The logic in the program counts the number of sides available for each unique stick length but does not consider the constraints of forming polygons. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the number of sticks of each length is divided into groups of at least three to form polygons. For example, in the input:

```
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```

The program would output `2`, which is incorrect because we can form one square (with sides of length 4) and one triangle (with sides of length 2), making the maximum number of polygons equal to `2`. However, the program only counts the number of unique lengths that have at least three sticks, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.
