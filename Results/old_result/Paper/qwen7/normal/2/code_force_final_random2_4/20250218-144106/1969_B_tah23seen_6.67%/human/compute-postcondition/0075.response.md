Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`, `cost` is 8, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `right` will be equal to the length of the list `s`. This is because the loop continues to increment `right` as long as `right` is less than the length of `s` and `s[right]` is not '0'. Once `right` reaches the length of `s` or `s[right]` becomes '0', the condition `right < len(s) and s[right] != '0'` fails, and the loop terminates. Since the loop does not modify `sChar`, `i`, `s`, `left`, `cost`, these variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states. Therefore, the final state of `left` will be the length of the list `s`, and `right` will also be the length of the list `s`.
