Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[1]` is '-1'**.

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` updates the element at index `i` of the list `s` to be `'-'1'`. Given that `i` is 1 from the initial state, `s[1]` changes from its initial value of `'0'` (if `flag` was 1) or `'1'` (if `flag` was 0) to `'-'1'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
