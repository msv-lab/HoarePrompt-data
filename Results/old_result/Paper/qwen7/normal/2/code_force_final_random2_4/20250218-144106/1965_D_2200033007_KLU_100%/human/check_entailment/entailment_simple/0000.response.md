Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function computes all possible cumulative sums of subarrays ending at each index of the input list `a`. It correctly returns a sorted list of these cumulative sums.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function processes a list of subarray sums (`cts`) and constructs a new list (`odds`) based on specific rules. However, the provided code for `func_2` has a logical error. It should remove the last element of `odds` if the current `ct` matches the last element of `odds`. Instead, it appends the current `ct` to `odds` unconditionally, which means `odds` will always contain all elements of `cts`. This will lead to incorrect results when trying to identify the missing subarray sum.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reconstructs the original palindrome array `a` from the list of subarray sums (`odds`). It correctly handles the symmetry of the palindrome by assigning values to the middle and symmetrically mirrored indices. However, the logic assumes that `idx` will eventually reach -1, which is not necessarily true if the input list is not processed correctly.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function aims to find the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists of subarray sums. However, the logic in this function is flawed. It removes elements from both lists until they are no longer equal or one of the lists becomes empty, and then it returns the last element of `bigList`. This approach does not guarantee finding the missing sum correctly, especially if the input lists are not processed properly.

Given the logical errors in `func_2` and `func_4`, the overall program will not correctly recover the palindrome array `a` for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
