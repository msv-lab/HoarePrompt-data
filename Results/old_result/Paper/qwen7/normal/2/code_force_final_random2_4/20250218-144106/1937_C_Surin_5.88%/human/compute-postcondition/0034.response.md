Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but its specific value is not provided.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `i` is explicitly given as 1. However, the values of `v1` and `prev` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, we need to leave them as `v1` and `prev`.

Output: **'? v1 1 v1 prev'**
