Output State: **Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is `n + t - 1`, `n` is the sum of all individual `n` values input during each iteration, and `s` is the final input string from the last iteration.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t` because the loop runs `t` times. The variable `a` will be set to 'TRIANGLE' if any string `s` contains exactly one '1' during any iteration, and it remains 'TRIANGLE' for the entire duration of the loop. Similarly, `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if no string `s` contains exactly one '1'. The variable `j` will be `n + t - 1` because the inner loop runs `n` times for each iteration of the outer loop, and there are `t` iterations in total. The variable `s` will hold the value of the last string input by the user during the final iteration of the loop.
