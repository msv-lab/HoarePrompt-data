Based on the initial state provided:

- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(l) - 1`.
- `k` will be 0.
- `ans1` will contain all elements from `l` starting from index 1 to `len(l) - 1`.
- `ans2` will also contain all elements from `l` starting from index 1 to `len(l) - 1`.

The `print(*ans2)` statement will print the elements of `ans2` separated by spaces. Since `ans2` contains all elements from `l` starting from index 1 to `len(l) - 1`, the same elements will be printed.

Output: **[all elements from l starting from index 1 to len(l) - 1]**
