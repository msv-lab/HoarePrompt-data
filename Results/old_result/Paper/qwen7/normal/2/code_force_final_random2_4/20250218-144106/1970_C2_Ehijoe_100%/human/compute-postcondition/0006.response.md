Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` now contains the value `v`**.

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Since `u` and `v` are both input integers, the list `nodes[u]` will now include `v`. The other variables (`n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
