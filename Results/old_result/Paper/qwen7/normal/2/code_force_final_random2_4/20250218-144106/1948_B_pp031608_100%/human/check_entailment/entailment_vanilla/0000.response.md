Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - An array `arr` is created from the input elements.
   - A boolean variable `ans` is initialized to `True`, indicating that the array is initially considered sortable.

3. **Checking Sortability**:
   - The program iterates backward through the array starting from the last element.
   - For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous one (`arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`).
   - If it finds such an element, it splits the larger element into its digits and checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted.
   - If the digits are not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, otherwise it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Sorting**:
   - The program attempts to split the larger element into its digits and check if the resulting list is sorted.
   - However, the logic for checking if the digits are sorted is flawed. It simply concatenates the digits and checks if the concatenated list is sorted, which does not guarantee that the original elements can be rearranged to form a sorted array.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array is already sorted or when the array can be made sorted by splitting elements.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program correctly identifies that splitting `45` and `67` can make the array sorted. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the array can be transformed into a sorted array by repeatedly splitting larger elements into their digits. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        def can_sort(arr):
            while True:
                sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
                if arr == sorted_arr:
                    return True
                for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
                    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                        num_str = str(arr[i - 1])
                        new_num = int(num_str + str(arr[i]))
                        if new_num >= 10:
                            arr[i - 1] = new_num
                            arr.pop(i)
                            break
                else:
                    return False
        
        if can_sort(arr):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program has logical flaws and does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
