Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `m-1` down to `1` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `m-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was between 1 and `m-1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `i - 1`.
   - **Variable `m`**: The value of `m` does not change within the loop. It remains the same as it was at the beginning of the loop.

4. **Postcondition adjustments**:
   - The postcondition states that `i` should be between 1 and `m-1`. After decrementing `i` by 1, `i` will still be within this range as long as `m > 1`.
   - The condition that `m` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.
   - `arr[i]` is either unchanged or adjusted based on the sorting check.
   - These conditions do not change with the loop iteration; they depend on the values of `i` and `m`, which are being adjusted.

Given these points, we can conclude the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is between 1 and `m-2`, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr[i]` is either unchanged or adjusted such that if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, the elements of `nums` (which contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`) are checked for sorting. If they are not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If they are sorted, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.**
