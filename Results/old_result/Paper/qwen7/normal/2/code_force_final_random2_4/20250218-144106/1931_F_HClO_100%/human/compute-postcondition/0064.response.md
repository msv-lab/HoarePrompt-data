Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `idx1` is equal to `i`; `idx2` is equal to `i`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no loop or conditional block was specified in the code snippet, we assume it was intended to exit from such a structure. Therefore, the values of `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain as they were before the `break` statement, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional.
