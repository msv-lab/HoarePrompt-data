Output State: **`t` is 2, `T` remains as the initial positive integer, `info` is a list of strings split from the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer**.

The code `info = input().split()` reads input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. The values of `t`, `T`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the new `info` list, but their specific values depend on the input provided by the user. The initial values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged, and `a` and `b` are set to the first and second elements of the `info` list, respectively, after converting them to integers.
