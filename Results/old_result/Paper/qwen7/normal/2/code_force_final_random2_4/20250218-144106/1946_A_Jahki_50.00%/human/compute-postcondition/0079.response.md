Output State: **`num2` is an input integer, `op` is incremented multiple times, `total` remains 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, and `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, with `new_median` being incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `num` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input for `num2`. This input affects the value of `num2`, making it an input integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
