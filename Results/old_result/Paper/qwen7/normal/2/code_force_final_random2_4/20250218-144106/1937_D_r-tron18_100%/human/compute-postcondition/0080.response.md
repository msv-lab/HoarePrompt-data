Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` are unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is equal to `2 * (len(suffZero) - 1)`, `oneInd` is equal to `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ans[i]` is equal to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`**

Explanation: The line `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the current values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `n`, and `fi`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `ans[i]` will be updated to the calculated value based on the given formula.
