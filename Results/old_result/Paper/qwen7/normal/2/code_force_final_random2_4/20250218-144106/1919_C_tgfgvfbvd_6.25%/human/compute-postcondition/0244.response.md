Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`, `a` is the value at index `n + 1` in list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `a`. Given that `x` is `n + 1`, `a` will be the value at index `n + 1` in list `l`. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
