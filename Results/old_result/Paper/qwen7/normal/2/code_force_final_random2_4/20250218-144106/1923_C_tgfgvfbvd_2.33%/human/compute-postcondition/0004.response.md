Output State: **`m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `l` is a list of integers converted from the input split by space, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `m`, `l`, or `p`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of these variables while updating `c` to 0.
