Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, where `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`, and `op` is 1. `b` is sorted.**

The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b`. Since `b` was already sorted before this line, sorting it again does not change its contents. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same, except that now `b` is explicitly stated to be sorted.
