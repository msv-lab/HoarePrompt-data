Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `path`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is either `1` or `-inf` depending on the first character of `path`, and the second element is `dp[0] + 1` if the second character of `path` is `@`, otherwise `dp[1]` is `dp[0]`. The character at index `i` of `path` is not `'*'`.
