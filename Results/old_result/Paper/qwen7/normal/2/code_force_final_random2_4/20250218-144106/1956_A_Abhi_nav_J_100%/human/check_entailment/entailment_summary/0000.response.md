Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the input in a way that suggests it expects the sequence `a` and the list of `n_i` values to be read multiple times for each test case. However, the problem description indicates that the sequence `a` and the list of `n_i` values are provided once per test case, and the function `func_1` should handle the logic for determining the number of winners based on these inputs.

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` is designed to return a value based on a simple comparison between `a` and `b`. Specifically, if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, it returns `a - 1`. Otherwise, it returns `b`. This implementation does not align with the problem's requirements. According to the problem, the function should simulate the game rounds and determine the number of players remaining after each round until no more players can be kicked out.

3. **Game Logic Missing**: The program lacks the logic to simulate the game rounds as described. It does not keep track of the players' positions, remove the specified players in each round, and continue until no more players can be removed.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus cannot produce the expected results.

Correctness: **False**
