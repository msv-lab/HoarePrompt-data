Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in l:`. The objects involved here are `x` and `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` is the variable used to iterate over each element in the list `l`.
   - `l` is a list of integers converted from the input split by space.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the list `l`. Therefore, the loop can only execute if `l` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is used to store each element of the list `l`, it doesn't need to be explicitly adjusted before the loop starts because it will take the value of each element in `l` during each iteration.
   - However, we need to ensure that `l` is not empty for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is an integer input from the user split by space (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `l` is a list of integers converted from the input split by space (we need to ensure this list is not empty).
- `p` is an empty list (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `c` is 0 (not directly relevant to the loop execution).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `l` to ensure it is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` must not be empty**
