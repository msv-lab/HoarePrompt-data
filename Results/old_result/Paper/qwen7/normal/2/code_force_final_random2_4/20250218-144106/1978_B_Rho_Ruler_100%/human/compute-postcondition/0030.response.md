Output State: `low` is the final value determined by the last iteration of the loop, `high` is `low - 1`, `max_profit` is the highest profit found during all iterations, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, and `profit_next` is the profit calculated at `mid + 1` in the last iteration.

In this final state, `low` and `high` converge to adjacent integers where further adjustments would not change the value of `max_profit`. The variable `max_profit` holds the highest profit value encountered throughout the iterations. `mid` represents the last midpoint calculated in the loop, and `profit_next` is the profit associated with `mid + 1` from the last iteration, which was used to decide whether to update `low` or `high`.
