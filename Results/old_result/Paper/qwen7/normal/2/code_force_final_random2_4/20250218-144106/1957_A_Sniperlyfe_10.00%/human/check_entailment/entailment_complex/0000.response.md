Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of regular polygons (with equal sides) that can be constructed using the given sticks without breaking any sticks.
2. A polygon with \( k \) sides requires \( k \) sticks of the same length.
3. The solution iterates through the list of stick lengths, counting the frequency of each length.
4. For each unique stick length, the function calculates how many complete polygons (with 3 or more sides) can be formed by dividing the frequency by 4 (since a polygon must have at least 3 sides).
5. The function sums these values to get the total number of polygons that can be formed.

Given the annotated program, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It counts the frequency of each stick length and then calculates the number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency by 4 for each unique length.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
