Postcondition: `y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`, `c` is increased by 1, and either `a` or `b` is updated based on the following conditions: if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is incremented by 1, `y` is `n - 1`, and `x` is `n + 1`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`.
