Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- The postcondition for the previous iteration is given as: 
  - If \( a - i \times (i - 1) > 0 \), then \( x \) remains unchanged and is equal to \( (a - i \times (i - 1)) // i \).
  - If \( a - i \times (i - 1) \leq 0 \), then \( x \) is not modified.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `b`.
- The loop body is omitted, but we know that the value of `x` is determined based on the condition involving `a` and `i`.

### Determining the Next State
To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
1. The value of `i` will increment by 1.
2. The value of `x` will be updated based on the condition involving `a` and the new value of `i`.

Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments by 1, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

### Updated State
- The value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The value of `x` will remain unchanged if the condition \( a - (i + 1) \times ((i + 1) - 1) > 0 \) holds true, otherwise, it will not be modified.

Given the condition:
\[ a - (i + 1) \times (i) > 0 \]

If this condition is true, then:
\[ x = \left( a - (i + 1) \times i \right) // (i + 1) \]

If the condition is false, then:
\[ x \text{ remains unchanged} \]

### Final State
State: **`x` is \((a - (i + 1) \times i) // (i + 1)\) if \( a - (i + 1) \times i > 0 \), otherwise `x` is not modified.** 

In summary, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` is \((a - (i + 1) \times i) // (i + 1)\) if \( a - (i + 1) \times i > 0 \), otherwise `x` is not modified.**
