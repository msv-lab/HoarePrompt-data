Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` contains `[sums + a[0]]`**

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding `a[i - 1]`, which is `a[0]` since `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` now contains the updated sum `[sums + a[0]]`.
