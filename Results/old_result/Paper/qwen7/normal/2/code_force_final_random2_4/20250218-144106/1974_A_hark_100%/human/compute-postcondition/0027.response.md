Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `x` is an input integer - `bxsfory` * 15 + `y` * 4, `y` is an input integer, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. Here, `bxsfory` is defined as the ceiling of `y` divided by 2. The other variables (`t`, `ap`, `k`) remain unchanged.
