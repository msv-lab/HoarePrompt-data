Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to count the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array based on the given conditions.
2. The program iterates through each test case, calculates the necessary modulo values, and uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of occurrences of these modulo values.
3. For each element in the array, it computes the required modulo values and checks if there are any previously seen elements that satisfy the conditions for forming a "beautiful pair".
4. The program correctly updates the frequency dictionary and counts the number of such pairs.
5. The logic for determining the required modulo values and checking the conditions seems correct.
6. The program prints intermediate steps which can help in debugging but are not necessary for the final output.

Given the description and the execution summary, the program appears to implement the logic correctly and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
