Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `char` and `expression`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `expression`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `count` is either 1 or 2, `expression` is a non-empty string of length `length-1`, and `char` is the second character in `expression`.

4. **Consider the loop body effects**: The loop body processes each character in `expression`. Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, `char` is the second character in `expression`. The loop will continue if there are more characters in `expression`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `char` will be the next character in `expression`.
   - `expression` will be the remaining part of the string after removing the current `char`.

6. **Check the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - If `char` is '+', `count` becomes 2.
   - Otherwise, `count` remains 1.

Given these points, let's determine the new state:

- `char` will be the third character in `expression` (since it was the second character before).
- `expression` will be the string without the first two characters.
- `count` will remain 1 or become 2 depending on the value of the third character.

Since we don't know the exact value of the third character, we need to consider both possibilities:

- If the third character is '+', `count` becomes 2.
- Otherwise, `count` remains 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration can be described as follows:

**State: **`count` is either 1 or 2, `expression` is a string of length `length-3`, `char` is the third character in `expression`**.
