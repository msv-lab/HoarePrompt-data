Output State: **`max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`; `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`; `combined` is a list with one item less than before (since `removed_item = combined.pop()`); `k` is less than or equal to 0; and `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped.**

This means that `max_profit` has been updated to the current value of `current_profit`. The values of `current_profit`, `combined`, `k`, and `heap` remain as described in the initial state, with `current_profit` being reduced by the value of `removed_item[0]`, `combined` having one item less, and `heap` being updated with one item pushed and another popped.
