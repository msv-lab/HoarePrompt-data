Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after the given moves. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board `n` and the number of moves `k`.

2. **Tracking Mirrored Moves:**
   - The variable `num` keeps track of the number of moves where the row and column indices are the same (`c == r`). For each such move, the computer cannot mirror the move, so it counts as a single unique move.
   - For other moves, since the computer mirrors the move, it counts as two unique moves.

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves:**
   - The remaining number of moves `m` is calculated as `n - num`. This represents the number of unique positions left to place rooks without attacking any existing rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The solution uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.
   - The base cases are initialized as follows:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: One way to place one rook.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Three ways to place two non-attacking rooks (either in different rows and columns, or mirrored positions).
   - For larger values of `m`, the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of ways to place `i` rooks.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the solution is correct and should produce the expected results for the provided examples and any valid inputs within the specified limits.
