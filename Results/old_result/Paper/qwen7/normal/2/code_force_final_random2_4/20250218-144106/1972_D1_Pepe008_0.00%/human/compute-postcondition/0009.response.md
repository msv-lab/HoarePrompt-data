Output State: **`suma` is equal to `x`, and `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` adds the current value of `x` to `suma`. Since the initial value of `x` is defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` and the condition that `(a - i * (i - 1))` is greater than 0 is met, `x` retains its initial value. Therefore, `suma` now includes the value of `x`.
