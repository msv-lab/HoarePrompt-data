Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is 1, `x` is `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is an input integer from the second input split, `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 <= 0` else the ceiling value of `(x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `bxsfory1` based on the value of `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. If `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is less than or equal to 0, then `bxsfory1` is set to 0. Otherwise, `bxsfory1` is set to the ceiling value of `(x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
