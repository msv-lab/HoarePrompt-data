Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start` is an integer
   - `end` is an integer
   - `t` is an input integer
   - `results` is a list
   - `i` is either 0 or 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `arr` is a string from input

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either 0 or 1, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.
   - `start`, `end`, `results`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, and it starts at 0 or 1, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1. The value of `t` does not change, and the other variables (`start`, `end`, `results`, `n`, and `arr`) remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (second iteration) will be:

State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a string from input.**
