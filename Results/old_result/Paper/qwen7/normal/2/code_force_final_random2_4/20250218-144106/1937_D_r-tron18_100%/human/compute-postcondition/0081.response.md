Postcondition: `el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` are unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are updated based on the following conditions: if `ol <= zr`, then `zeroInd` is 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, and `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]` - `func_1(preOne, 1)`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is equal to `2 * (len(suffZero) - 1)`, and `oneInd` is equal to `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Additionally, `fi` is updated to `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` when `ol > zr`. The value of `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` in both cases, and `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `n` remains unchanged.
