Output State: **`current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is a positive integer, `heap` is a list containing the last element of `combined` pushed into it, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` must be greater than 1, `max_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops the last element from the `combined` list and pushes it onto the `heap`. This operation modifies the `heap` but does not affect the other variables. The `current_profit`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `n`, `k`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged. The `combined` list is also not altered in terms of its sorting property since the operation only removes and adds elements without re-sorting.
