Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `soma_b` is 0, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input, `lista_A` is a list of n integers in reverse order compared to its original state, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - k):
    if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
        pref += soma_b
        pref += lista_A[i]
        soma_b = 0
    else:
        soma_b += lista_B[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `soma_b` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `soma_b` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `m + 1` where `m` is the current value of `i` from the previous iteration and `m + 1 < n - k`. If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, `soma_b` remains unchanged and `pref` is set to `soma_b + lista_A[i]`. Otherwise, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]` and `pref` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `soma_b` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `m + 2` where `m` is the current value of `i` from the previous iteration and `m + 2 < n - k`. If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, `soma_b` remains unchanged and `pref` is set to `soma_b + lista_A[i]`. Otherwise, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]` and `pref` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
