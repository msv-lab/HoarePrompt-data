You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `a` is a list containing five elements, where the first two elements are strings from the initial input, the third element is a new string from the second input, the fourth element is another new string from the third input, and the fifth element is the final input from the fourth iteration of the loop.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is 2 times in this case), the list `a` will contain four inputs provided through the `input()` function, resulting in a list with five elements in total.

    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `n` will be 4 (since the loop runs from `i` in `range(n - 1)`), and the loop has executed three times as described in the previous states. The conditions inside the loop did not change `x` and `y` further after the third iteration, so they remain at `x` is 3 and `y` is 3. The variable `i` reaches 3, which is the last index in the range. The string `s` is constructed as 'input1input21' based on the logic provided in the third iteration's description.

    #State: Output State: `x` is 4, `i` is 4, `t` is 1, `a` is a list of lists where the second sublist contains at least 4 elements, `s` is a string 'input1input21'.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i` starting at 3 up to but not including `y` which is 3), the value of `i` reaches 4 without finding a match for the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]`. Therefore, the variable `t` remains 1, and the values of `x`, `i`, `a`, and `s` do not change from their last known state after the third iteration.

    #This is printed: input1input21

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the binary strings for the top and bottom rows of the grid.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Path:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the resulting binary string.
   - It sets initial positions `x` and `y` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `n-1` columns of the grid to find the first position where the path can turn right or down.
     - If `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'`, it updates `y` to `i`.
     - If `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`, it constructs the string `s` from the beginning up to `i+1` from the top row and the rest from the bottom row starting from `i`. It also updates `x` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such position is found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire top row and the last element of the bottom row, setting `x` to `n-1`.

3. **Counting Paths:**
   - The program initializes a counter `t` to 1.
   - It iterates through the positions from `y` to `x` to check if the substring of the bottom row matches the substring of `s`.
     - If a match is found, it updates `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the constructed string `s`.
   - It prints the count `t`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of Paths:**
   - The program only considers the first occurrence of a valid path and does not explore all possible paths to ensure the lexicographically smallest string is found.
   - The logic for constructing `s` and counting paths is flawed because it does not correctly handle all possible paths that could yield the lexicographically smallest string.

2. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The program assumes that the first valid path found is the optimal one, which is not necessarily true. It should consider all possible paths to ensure the lexicographically smallest string is found.
   - The counting logic is also incorrect as it does not account for all possible valid paths.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
