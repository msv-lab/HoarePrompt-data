Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will execute `n-1` times in total. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-2`. The variable `u` and `v` will each hold the last pair of integers input during the loop. The `nodes` dictionary will represent the complete graph structure with each node connected to all other nodes via the edges provided by the user inputs. The variable `empty` remains `True` and `t` remains 1, as neither is modified within the loop. The `leaves` deque is initialized.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `nodes` is a dictionary and `leaves` is a list. If the list associated with the key in `nodes` has exactly one element, then the key is added to the `leaves` list. Otherwise, the `leaves` list remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `nodes` is a dictionary, `key` is the next key in the `nodes` dictionary, and `leaves` is a list with an additional element `key`. If the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, then `key` is added to the `leaves` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nodes` is a dictionary with at least one key, `key` is the next key in the `nodes` dictionary, and `leaves` is a list with an additional element `key`. If `len(nodes[key])` equals 1, then no change is made to `nodes` and `leaves`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
