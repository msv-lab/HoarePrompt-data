Output State: **`total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is incremented multiple times, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b` and is now greater than `median` + 1, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `b` is a sorted version of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `b[ma] += 1` increments the value at the index `ma` in list `b` by 1. Since `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b` and is greater than `median`, after incrementing `b[ma]`, `new_median` will now be `median + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
