Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the input value, `m` is the second input value, `k` is the third input value**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The variable `i` remains unchanged and still holds the value 0. The initial value of `n` is replaced by the first input value, `m` gets the second input value, and `k` gets the third input value.
