Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is between 0 and `m-3`, `m` must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `arr[i]` is either unchanged or adjusted such that if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the context it was used in, which could be a loop or an if-statement. The values of `ans`, `i`, `m`, `nums`, and `arr[i]` remain as they were in the initial state.
