Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `j` is less than 3**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by concatenating it with the character obtained from `info[0][0]` converted to a character using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`. Since `i` and `j` are both 0 initially, `temp` becomes the character corresponding to `info[0][0]` plus 96. The values of `i`, `j`, `cases`, and the condition on `j` remain unchanged.
