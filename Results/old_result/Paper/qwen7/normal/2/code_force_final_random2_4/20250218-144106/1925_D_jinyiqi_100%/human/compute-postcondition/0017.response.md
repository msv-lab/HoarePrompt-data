Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `j` is `m-1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the `m` iterations, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)**.

This output state reflects that all the variables retain their initial conditions except for the introduction of `p`, which is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
