Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer value converted from the original string input, `m` is an integer value converted from the original string input**.

Explanation: The code `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the strings `n` and `m` into integers and assigns them back to `n` and `m` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0.
