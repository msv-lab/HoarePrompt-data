Postcondition: `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b` // 2 or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer, and `t` is updated as follows: if `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is increased by either `t2 // 15` or `t2 // 15 + 1`, where `t2` is `a - t1`.
