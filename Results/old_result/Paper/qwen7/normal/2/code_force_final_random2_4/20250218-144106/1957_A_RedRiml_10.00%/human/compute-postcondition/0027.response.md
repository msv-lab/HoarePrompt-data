Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`, which comes from the list `palka`.
   - The other variables involved in the loop head are `palka` and `pl`.

2. **Understand the Postconditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `w` remains greater than 0.
   - `ln` remains unchanged.
   - `palka` remains a list of at least one integer.
   - `pl` now includes the first element of `palka` and the next element of `palka` if it is not already in `pl`.
   - `d` is a dictionary where for each `i` (the next element of `palka`), `d[i]` is either set to 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None`, or incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `palka`, the first element of `palka` will be assigned to `i` in the next iteration.
   - The next element of `palka` (if it exists) will be added to `pl` if it is not already present.
   - The dictionary `d` will be updated based on the value of `i`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `w` remains greater than 0.
- `ln` remains unchanged.
- `palka` loses its first element since it is used in the current iteration.
- `pl` will include the first element of `palka` and the next element of `palka` if it is not already in `pl`.
- `d` will be updated based on the first element of `palka`.

Assuming the first element of `palka` is `i_0` and the next element (if it exists) is `i_1`:

- `palka` becomes `palka[1:]` (all elements except the first).
- `pl` includes `i_0` and `i_1` if `i_1` is not already in `pl`.
- `d` is updated based on `i_0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` remains greater than 0, `ln` remains unchanged, `palka` is a list of at least one integer (excluding the first element of the previous list), `pl` includes the first element of `palka` and the next element of `palka` if it is not already in `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary where for each `i` (the next element of `palka`), `d[i]` is either set to 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None`, or incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None`.**
