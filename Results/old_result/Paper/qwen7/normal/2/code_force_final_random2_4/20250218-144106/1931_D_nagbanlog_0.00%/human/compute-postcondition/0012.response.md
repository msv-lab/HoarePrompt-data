Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [(x - mod_x) % x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]** 

Explanation:
- `num` is a number whose remainders when divided by `x` and `y` are stored in `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively.
- `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This means if `mod_x` is less than `x`, then `required_mod_x` will be `x - mod_x`. If `mod_x` is already 0, then `required_mod_x` will be 0.
- `required_mod_y` is directly equal to `mod_y`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` as described.
