Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is an integer, and `arr` contains the element 26.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the element `26` to the list `arr`. The initial state of `j` being `1` and `lex` being an integer remain unchanged. The condition regarding the value of `lex` does not affect the execution of this line of code, so the value of `lex` itself is not altered. Therefore, the updated state includes `arr` now containing the element `26`.
