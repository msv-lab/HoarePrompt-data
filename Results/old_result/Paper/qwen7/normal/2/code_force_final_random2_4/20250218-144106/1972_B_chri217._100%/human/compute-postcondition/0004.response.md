Output State: **`cases` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the first line of input from stdin with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()` and then strips any leading or trailing whitespace using `.strip()`. The stripped line is assigned to the variable `s`. The initial state of `cases` and `n` remains unchanged.
