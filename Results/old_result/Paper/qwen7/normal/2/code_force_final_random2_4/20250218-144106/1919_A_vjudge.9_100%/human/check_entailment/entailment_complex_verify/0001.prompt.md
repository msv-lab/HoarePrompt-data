You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is `t-1`, `a` and `b` are input integers assigned the values of two integers input by the user separated by a space during the last iteration of the loop. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the loop prints 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the loop prints 'Alice'. The values of `a` and `b` from the last iteration are retained as they are.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 1000) followed by \( t \) pairs of positive integers \( a \) and \( b \) (1 ≤ \( a, b \) ≤ 10^9). For each pair, it checks if the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \) is even or odd. If the difference is even, it prints 'Bob'; if odd, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing one coin from their current wallet until one of them cannot make a valid move. The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - If `a` (Alice's coins) and `b` (Bob's coins) are such that `abs(a - b)` is even, then Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. This means that whenever Alice removes a coin and chooses whether to swap wallets or not, Bob can do the opposite (swap or not swap) and maintain the same parity of the difference. Eventually, Alice will be forced to make a move when her wallet is empty, and Bob can continue until Alice cannot make a move.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, then Alice can always make a move that changes the parity, forcing Bob into a losing position eventually.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b` using `abs(a - b)`.
   - It then checks if this difference is even or odd using the condition `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`. If true, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.
   - This logic aligns perfectly with the game dynamics described above.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases where `a` and `b` are within the specified range (1 to \(10^9\)).
   - It correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules and the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
