Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for sz in a`. The variables involved here are `sz` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.
   - `sz` is the variable that will take each element of the list `a` one by one during the loop iterations.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. The loop will start with the first element of the list and continue until all elements have been processed.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `sz` will take the value of each element in the list `a` during the loop, we need to ensure that `sz` is set to the first element of the list `a` initially.
   - The list `a` itself should remain as it is since it is the source of values for `sz`.

5. **Consider other given states**:
   - `mexsize` is 1 (this is not directly related to the loop head).
   - `tc` is incremented by 1 (this is not directly related to the loop head).
   - `n` is an input integer (this is not directly related to the loop head).
   - `t` remains unchanged (this is not directly related to the loop head).
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a` (this is not directly related to the loop head).

Given this analysis, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are those involving `sz` and `a`.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:
**`sz` is the first element of the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`sz` is the first element of the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user**
