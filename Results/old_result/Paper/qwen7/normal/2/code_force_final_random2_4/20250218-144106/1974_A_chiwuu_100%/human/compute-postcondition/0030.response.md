Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. Each iteration updates the value of `t` based on the condition provided in the postcondition.

3. **Determine the changes needed**: Since the loop updates `t` based on the condition involving `t1` and `t2`, and these values are not directly part of the loop head, they remain unchanged within the loop head context. However, the loop itself depends on `i` and `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - `n` must remain the same for the loop to continue.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, we need to ensure that the loop can continue to the next iteration. This means `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

**Step-by-step reasoning**:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b` // 2 or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `a` is an integer.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t1` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to 1).
- `i` is incremented by 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b` // 2 or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1**
