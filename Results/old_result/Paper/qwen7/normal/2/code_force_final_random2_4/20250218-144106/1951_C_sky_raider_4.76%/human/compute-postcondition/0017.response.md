Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is `c + l[3] * s - s * s / 2`, `k` is `k - 3 * s`, `s` is `min(m, k - s)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c` by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, `c` is updated to `c + l[3] * s - s * s / 2`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `s`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
