Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and `a` is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, but now `n` and `x` have been updated by the function `func_3()`**.

This means that the values of `n` and `x` have been changed by the function `func_3()`, but the precondition for `a` remains the same. The exact new values of `n` and `x` are not specified because they depend on the implementation of `func_3()`.
