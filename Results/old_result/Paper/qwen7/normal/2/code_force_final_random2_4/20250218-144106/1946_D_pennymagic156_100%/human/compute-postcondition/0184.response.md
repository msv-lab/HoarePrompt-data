Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for val in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `val` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop updates the variable `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between its current value and the result of `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1. Additionally, it sets `op` to `False` if the current value of `op` is `False`. The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `op` is updated by performing the bitwise XOR operation between its current value and the result of `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1, and the current value of `op` is `False`.
   - `cnt` is 1.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `cnt` is 1, it means that only one iteration has occurred. Therefore, `val` will be the first element of the list `a`.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `val` will be set to the first element of the list `a`.
   - `cnt` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `a` must have at least one element remaining.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`op` is updated by performing the bitwise XOR operation between its current value and the result of `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1, and the current value of `op` is False; `cnt` is 2; `val` is the first element of the list `a` and `a` must have at least one element**.
