Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans1` has the element `l[0]` and `l[i]` appended to it, `ans2` has the elements `l[0]` and `l[1]` appended to it, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code appends `l[i]` to `ans1`. Given that `i` is 3, `l[i]` refers to `l[3]`. Since `ans1` already had `l[0]` appended to it, now it will have both `l[0]` and `l[3]`. The values of `k`, `ans2`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
