Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` contains at least one element less than before, `a` is the first element of `numbers` before popping, `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping, `suma` is `2 * min(a, b)`; `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the `numbers` list and assigns it to `b`. Since `a` was the first element of `numbers` before popping, `b` now holds the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
