t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and x separated by a space, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30; the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n separated by spaces, where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30; and the function does not return anything for the current function signature, implying that the main logic for solving each test case is implemented elsewhere.
