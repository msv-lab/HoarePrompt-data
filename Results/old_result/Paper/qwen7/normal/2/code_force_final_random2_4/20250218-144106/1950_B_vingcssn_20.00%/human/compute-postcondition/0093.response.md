Output State: `casos` must be greater than 0, `c` equals `casos`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), and `n` is an integer input for each iteration from 0 to `casos-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `c` will be equal to the initial value of `casos`, meaning the loop has completed all its intended iterations. The variable `t` remains within its initial bounds, and `n` represents the input integer for each of the `casos` iterations.
