Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[3]` and `a[2]`, and this minimum value remains greater than the original `max` regardless of whether the condition `min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max` is true or false.
