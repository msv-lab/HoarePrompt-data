Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `index` is increased by 2; `path` is the value of `data[index]`**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Since `index` was previously increased by 1, it is now increased by 2 in total. The other variables (`t` and `path`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
