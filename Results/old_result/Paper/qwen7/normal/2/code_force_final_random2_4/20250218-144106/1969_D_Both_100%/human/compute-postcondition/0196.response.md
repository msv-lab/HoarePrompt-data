Postcondition: `max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` is either `current_profit - item[1]` or `func_3(combined, heap) + item[0]` depending on whether `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `combined` is now a list with one item less than before (since `item = combined.pop()`), `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an empty heap.
