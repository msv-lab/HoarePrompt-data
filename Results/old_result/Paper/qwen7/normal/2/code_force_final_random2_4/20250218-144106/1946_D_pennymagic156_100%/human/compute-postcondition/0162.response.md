Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`, and `t` is a list with two additional elements `ai`.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`. The value of `val` remains the next element in the list `a`, and `ai` is updated and added to the list `t`. The initial values of `a`, `val`, and `t` remain unchanged except for the modifications within the code snippet.
