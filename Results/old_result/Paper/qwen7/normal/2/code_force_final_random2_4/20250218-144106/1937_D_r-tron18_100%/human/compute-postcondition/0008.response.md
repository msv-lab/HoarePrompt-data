Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[i]` and is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**.

This means that the value of `el` remains unchanged and is still `'>'`. The variables `ol` and `zr` have been assigned the values of `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1` respectively. The initial conditions for `el` and the expressions for `ol` and `zr` are now part of the current state.
