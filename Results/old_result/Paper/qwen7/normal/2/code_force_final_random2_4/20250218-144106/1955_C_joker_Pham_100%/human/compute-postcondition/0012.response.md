Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is less than `a[r]`, then no changes are made to the variables and the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
