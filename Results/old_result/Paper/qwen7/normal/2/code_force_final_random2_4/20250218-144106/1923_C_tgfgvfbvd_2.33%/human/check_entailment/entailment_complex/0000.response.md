Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `l` and stores it in the list `p`. This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray using the formula \( \text{sum}(l[a-1:b]) = p[b-1] - p[a-2] \) (if \(a > 1\)).

2. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program computes the sum of the specified subarray using the cumulative sums stored in `p`. It then checks if this sum is at least twice the length of the subarray. If so, it prints 'YES', indicating the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where the subarray starts from the beginning of the array (i.e., \(a = 1\)) by directly using `p[b-1]`.

4. **Input and Output**: The program correctly reads the input as per the problem statement and outputs the results in the required format.

Given the above points, the program accurately implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
