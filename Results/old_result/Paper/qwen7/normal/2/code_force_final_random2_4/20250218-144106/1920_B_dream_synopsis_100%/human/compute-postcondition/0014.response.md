Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` contains the value of `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 0 and the value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, the value of `sums` remains unchanged as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The value of `k` remains a non-negative integer, and the rest of the conditions and values remain as they were initially.
