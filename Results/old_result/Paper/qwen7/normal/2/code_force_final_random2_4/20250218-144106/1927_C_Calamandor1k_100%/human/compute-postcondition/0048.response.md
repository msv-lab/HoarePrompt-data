Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `unique_a` is a set containing elements from `a`, `results` list now contains 'YES', `unique_b` is a set containing elements from `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`.**

Explanation: The code `only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b` updates the value of `only_a` to be the set difference between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. This means `only_a` now contains only the elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state description.
