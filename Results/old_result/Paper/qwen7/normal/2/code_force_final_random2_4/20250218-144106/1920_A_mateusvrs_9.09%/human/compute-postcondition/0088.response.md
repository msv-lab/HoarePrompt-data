Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(n)` function. This means the loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `n` are the ones that determine the loop execution.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Determine the new state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1 from its current value. Since `n` was greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be greater than 0, allowing the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `n` will be decremented by 1.
   - The other variables (`a`, `x`, and `bx`, `ax`, `cx`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` if `a` equals 1, `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and `ax` if `a` equals 2, otherwise `x` is added to the set `cx`**.
