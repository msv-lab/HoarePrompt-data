Output State: `t` is a list containing the results of applying the XOR operation on `ai` with each value in `a` based on the condition `not op`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `u` is 0, `v` is 0, `op` is the final value of `op` after processing all elements in `a`, `ai` is 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will contain all the values of `ai` that were appended when `op` was `False`. The variable `op` will be the result of the cumulative XOR operation performed on the bits of the values in `a` at the position specified by `i`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `ai`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
