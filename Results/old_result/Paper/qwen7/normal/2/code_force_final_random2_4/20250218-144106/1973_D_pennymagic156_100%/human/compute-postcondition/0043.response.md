Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `-1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is `k - 3`, but since `k` is not explicitly defined, we only know it will be adjusted by subtracting 3 from its original value.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`, where `func_2()` is not defined, so we cannot determine its exact value.
   - `cnt` is `0`.
   - `l` is also equal to `n + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `-1`.
- `v` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.

Given the print statement `print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)`, we need to substitute the known value of `i` and leave `v` as undefined because it is not provided.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **! -1 * v**
