Output State: **`k` is not 0, `i` is len(l) - 2, `q` is len(l) - 2, `t` is len(l) - 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element into an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `k`, `i`, `q`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
