Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and functionality of each part of the code, especially focusing on how it interacts with the problem requirements and the provided execution summaries.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_3()` is used to read the input which includes `n`, `k`, and `r`. This matches the expected input format.
   - `func_1()` and `func_2()` are used to read lists and integers respectively, which are also consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Finding the Value `v`:**
   - `func_5()` starts by finding a value `v` through a series of queries. It iterates backward from `n` to `1`, printing a query `? 1 {i * n}` and checking the response. If the response is `n`, it sets `v = i` and breaks out of the loop. This step ensures that `v` is set to the smallest value such that `f(1, r) = i * n` for some `r`.

3. **Splitting the Array:**
   - After determining `v`, the function attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has a product of its length and maximum value equal to `v`.
   - It uses a nested loop to check if such a split is possible. For each potential starting point `l`, it prints a query `? {l} {i * v}` and checks the response. If the response indicates that the current subarray cannot be extended to meet the criteria, it moves to the next potential starting point.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - If a valid split is found, it prints the result `! {i * v}` and ends.
   - If no valid split is found after all attempts, it prints `! -1` and ends.

Given the execution summaries and the problem description, the function `func_5()` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input reading, value determination, and splitting process as specified.

Correctness: **True**
