Output State: `numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^3\) and \(\text{numero_testes} > 2\); `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `numero_testes` will be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), but it will definitely be greater than 2, as the loop runs from 1 to `numero_testes - 1`. Additionally, `func_1()` will have been called exactly `numero_testes` times.
