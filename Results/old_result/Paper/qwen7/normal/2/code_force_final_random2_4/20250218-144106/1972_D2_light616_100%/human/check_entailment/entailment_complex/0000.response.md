Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy specific conditions involving the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the relationship between \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and \(a + b\).
- `func_1()` is designed to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) to find valid pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy the conditions. The logic inside the function checks if \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\) and then calculates the contribution to the count based on the constraints.
- The function correctly initializes the variables and uses nested loops to check pairs \((x, y)\) within the specified ranges. It also ensures that the gcd condition is met and updates the count accordingly.
- `func_2()` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case. It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each one, ensuring that the function is called the correct number of times.
- Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the functions appear to correctly solve the problem as described. The provided example outputs match the expected results, indicating that the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
