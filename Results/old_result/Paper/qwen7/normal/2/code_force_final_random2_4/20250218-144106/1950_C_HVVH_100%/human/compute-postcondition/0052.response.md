Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer. If `h` is 0, then `day` is set to 'AM' and `h` is set to 12. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If none of these conditions apply, `day` remains as 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.
