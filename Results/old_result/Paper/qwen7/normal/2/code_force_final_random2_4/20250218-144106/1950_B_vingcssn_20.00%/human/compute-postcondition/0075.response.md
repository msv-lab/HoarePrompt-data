Output: **..##..**

Explanation: The initial state does not provide specific values for any variables or objects. It only states that `casos` must be greater than 0, `c` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 20, and `n` is an integer input. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `..##..`, which is explicitly provided in the code snippet and does not depend on the values of the other variables.
