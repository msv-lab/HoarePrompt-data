Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence \(a\) of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there exists a subsequence of \(a\) that sums to \(v\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles multiple test cases using a loop.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
   - For each \(k\), it calculates and appends specific values to `nums`:
     - \(k - \text{max power of 2} \leq k\)
     - \(k + 1\)
     - \(k + \text{max power of 2} + 1\)
   - It removes the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) from `nums`.

3. **Verification**:
   - **No Subsequence Summing to \(k\)**: By removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) and ensuring that no two elements in `nums` sum to \(k\), the condition is satisfied.
   - **Subsequences Summing to Other Values**: The remaining elements in `nums` cover all values from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\), ensuring that every possible sum from 1 to \(n-1\) can be formed by some subsequence.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The approach works for all given constraints and examples.
   - The length of `nums` is controlled to be at most 25, as required.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the code aligns with the problem requirements and constraints.
   - The implementation ensures that the constructed sequence meets all specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
