The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and `numero_testes`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop continues based on the value of `numero_testes`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^3\) and \(\text{numero_testes} > 0\). For the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `numero_testes` should be decremented by 1 and must still satisfy the condition \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^3\) and \(\text{numero_testes} > 0\).

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^3\) and \(\text{numero_testes} > 1\)**
