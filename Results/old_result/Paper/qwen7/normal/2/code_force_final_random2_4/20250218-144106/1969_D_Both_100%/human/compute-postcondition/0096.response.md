Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(k)`. This means the loop variable is an underscore (`_`), which is a common practice when the variable itself is not used within the loop body. However, the loop still depends on the value of `k`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `current_profit` remains 0
   - `max_profit` remains 0
   - `heap` contains either the second tuple from `combined` or the first tuple from `combined`
   - `remaining_items` is an empty list
   - `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`
   - `n` is the return value of `func_2()`
   - `k` must be greater than 1
   - `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`

3. **Determine the Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the loop variable `_` is not used, the only thing that changes with each iteration is the value of `k`. The loop will continue as long as `k` is greater than 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be decremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `current_profit` remains 0 (it is not affected by the loop)
   - `max_profit` remains 0 (it is not affected by the loop)
   - `heap` remains unchanged (it is not affected by the loop)
   - `remaining_items` remains an empty list (it is not affected by the loop)
   - `neg_prices` remains unchanged (it is not affected by the loop)
   - `k` is decremented by 1, so it must be greater than 0
   - `bonuses` remains unchanged (it is not affected by the loop)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` remains 0, `heap` contains either the second tuple from `combined` or the first tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**
