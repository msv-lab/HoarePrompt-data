Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

The code `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
