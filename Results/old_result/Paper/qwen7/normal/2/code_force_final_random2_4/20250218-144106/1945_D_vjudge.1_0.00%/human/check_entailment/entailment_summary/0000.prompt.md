Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:

        soma_b += lista_B[i]
    print(resultado)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (with the condition 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` each containing `n` integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. It processes these inputs by comparing elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` in reverse order, calculating a cumulative sum (`soma_b`) of elements in `lista_B` and determining a prefix sum (`pref`) based on certain conditions. Finally, it computes the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for specific indices and prints this minimum value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and two lists \(a\) and \(b\). It then calls `func_1()` exactly `numero_testes` times, where `numero_testes` is initially read from input and must be between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. After processing all test cases, `numero_testes` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1,000 inclusive, but it will always be greater than 2. The function does not return any value.
