Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b` // 2 or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer.**

This means that `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, while `t` remains either `b` // 2 or 1, `n` stays greater than or equal to 1, and `a` remains an integer.
