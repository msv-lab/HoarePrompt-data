Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer.
   - `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - `ans` is a list containing two elements, which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`.
   - `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `ans` has been extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))` zeros.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `i` is either 0 or 1. Let's consider both cases:
     - If `i = 0`, then `(1 << i) - 1` evaluates to `(1 << 0) - 1 = 0`.
     - If `i = 1`, then `(1 << i) - 1` evaluates to `(1 << 1) - 1 = 1`.
   - `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer.
   - `ans` starts as a list with two elements: `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`.
   - Since `ans` initially has only two elements, it gets extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))` zeros. This means if `n > 2`, `ans` will have `n` elements, where the first two elements remain the same and the rest are zeros.

4. **Final Value of `ans`:**
   - The first element of `ans` is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is either 0 or 1.
   - The second element of `ans` is `k - sum(ans)`. Since `ans` initially has only two elements, the sum of `ans` is the sum of these two elements. If `i = 0`, the sum is `0 + (k - 0) = k`. If `i = 1`, the sum is `1 + (k - 1) = k`.
   - After extending `ans` by `[0] * (n - len(ans))` zeros, the list will have `n` elements, with the first two elements being `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and the rest being zeros.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the above analysis, the output will be:

Output: **(1 << i) - 1 k - sum(ans) 0 ... 0** (where the number of trailing zeros depends on `n`).

To provide a more concrete example, let's assume `i = 0` and `k = 5` and `n = 4`:

- `i = 0`, so `(1 << i) - 1 = 0`.
- `k - sum(ans) = 5 - (0 + 0) = 5`.
- `ans` becomes `[0, 5]`.
- Extending `ans` by `[0] * (4 - 2) = [0, 0]`, so `ans` becomes `[0, 5, 0, 0]`.

Therefore, the output would be:

Output: **0 5 0 0**
