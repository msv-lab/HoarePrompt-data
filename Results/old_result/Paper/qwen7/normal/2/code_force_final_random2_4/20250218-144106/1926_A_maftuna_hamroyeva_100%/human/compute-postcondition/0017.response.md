Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `a`. After each iteration, `j` is set to the next character in the string `a`.

3. **Determine the postconditions based on the previous iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a non-empty string.
   - `j` is the next character in the string `a`.
   - If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 1.
   - If `j` is not 'A', then `h` is 2.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the next character in the string `a`, after the current iteration, `j` will be the next character in `a`.
   - The string `a` will lose its first character (the current `j`), but it must still be a non-empty string for the loop to continue.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` must still be a non-empty string because if it were empty, the loop would terminate.
   - `j` will be the next character in the updated string `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the next character in the string `a`**.
