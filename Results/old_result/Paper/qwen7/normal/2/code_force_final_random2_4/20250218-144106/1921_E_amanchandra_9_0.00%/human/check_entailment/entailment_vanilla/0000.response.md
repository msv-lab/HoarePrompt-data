Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions of the board (`h`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`).

2. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `xa > xb`. If true, it prints 'Draw'. This condition is incorrect because it doesn't consider the optimal strategy for both players. The comparison `xa > xb` alone is not sufficient to determine the outcome.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the absolute difference between the rows of Alice's and Bob's chips: `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
   - This calculation is used to determine how many moves it would take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet, considering their movement constraints.

4. **Odd and Even Distance Handling**:
   - If the distance between rows is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), the program calculates the possible range of columns for Alice and Bob: `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
   - It then checks if Alice can force a win by comparing the distances from the middle column range to the current column positions of Alice and Bob.

5. **Even Distance Handling**:
   - If the distance between rows is even, similar logic is applied but with different column ranges and checks.

6. **Win/Lose/Draw Determination**:
   - The program uses these calculations to determine if Alice or Bob can force a win or if the game results in a draw.

### Correctness Evaluation

The provided solution is flawed because it does not fully account for the optimal strategies of both players. Specifically:

- The initial condition check `if xa > xb:` is incorrect and overly simplistic.
- The logic for determining the outcome based on the distance and column ranges is not comprehensive enough to cover all scenarios where players might force a win or result in a draw.

### Example Test Cases

Let's verify the provided test cases with the given program:

```plaintext
Input:
12
6 5 2 2 5 3
4 1 2 1 4 1
1 4 1 3 1 1
5 5 1 4 5 2
4 4 1 1 4 4
10 10 1 6 10 8
10 10 2 6 10 7
10 10 9 1 8 1
10 10 8 1 10 2
10 10 1 1 2 1
10 10 1 3 4 1
10 10 3 1 1 1

Output:
Alice
Bob
Draw
Draw
Draw
Alice
Draw
Draw
Bob
Alice
Alice

```

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the optimal strategies of both players. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
