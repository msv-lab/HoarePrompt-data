Reasoning:

1. The provided code reads input and processes multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.
2. For each test case, it correctly counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
3. Based on the count of 'U', it appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list, which is done correctly.
4. The logic inside the loop checks if the number of 'U' is odd or even and decides the winner accordingly. This matches the problem's requirement that Alice wins if the number of 'U' is odd and Bob wins if the number of 'U' is even.
5. The code then prints the results for each test case, which is also done correctly.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
