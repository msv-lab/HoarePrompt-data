Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for res in results:`. The only variable mentioned here is `res`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: Since the loop iterates over each element in `results`, the variable `res` changes with each iteration. However, the other variables (`index`, `t`, `p`, and `data`) remain unchanged within the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `results` to iterate over. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` had one less element than before.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration. This means `results` should have two fewer elements than it started with.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` with two fewer elements.
- `index` remains the same.
- `t` remains 0.
- `p` remains the same.
- `data` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` with two fewer elements, `index` is set to the initial value, `t` is 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace**
