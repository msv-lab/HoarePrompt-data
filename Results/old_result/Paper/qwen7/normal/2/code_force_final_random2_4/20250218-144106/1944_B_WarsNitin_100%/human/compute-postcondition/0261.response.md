Output State: **`k` is 2 * `k`, `i` is len(l) - 2, `q` is len(l) - 2, `t` is len(l) - 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list containing the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, and `c` is sorted, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated to be twice its original value (`2 * k`). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
