Output State: **`cx` must have at least one element; `i` is equal to `bx` plus `tmp`; `tmp` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The variable `tmp` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is initially greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, after the increment, `i` will be equal to `bx` plus the new value of `tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
