Postcondition: `max_profit` and `current_profit` remain 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple (except the last one which was possibly popped), `k` is greater than 0, and if `combined` is not empty, `heap` is a heap containing the last element of the `combined` list after possibly popping the last element and pushing it into the heap.
