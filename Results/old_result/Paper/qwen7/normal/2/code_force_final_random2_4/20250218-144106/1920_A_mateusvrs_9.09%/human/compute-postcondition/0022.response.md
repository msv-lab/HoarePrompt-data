Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx` if `bx` was defined previously, otherwise `bx` is `x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum between `x` and the current value of `bx` (if `bx` was previously defined). If `bx` was not defined before, it is set to `x`. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged.
