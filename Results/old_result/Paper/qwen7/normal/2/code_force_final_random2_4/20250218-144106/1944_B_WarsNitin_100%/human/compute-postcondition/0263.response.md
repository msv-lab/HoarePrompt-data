Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `i` is len(l) - 2, `q` is len(l) - 2, `t` is len(l) - 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list containing the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, and `c` is sorted, `req` is `k`, `l` is an empty list.**

The code `l = []` initializes an empty list `l`. This affects the variable `l` by setting it to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
