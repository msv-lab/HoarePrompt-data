Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `tmp` is equal to 0, `t` is equal to `max(0, t)`**.

Explanation: The code `t = max(tmp, t)` updates `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and `t`. Given that `tmp` is initially 0, `max(0, t)` will be `t` if `t` is greater than or equal to 0, and 0 if `t` is less than 0. Since the initial value of `tmp` is 0, the output state reflects that `t` is updated to its maximum value between itself and 0.
