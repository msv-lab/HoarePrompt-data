Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 0, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The code sets `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` to 0, which means the frequency count for the specific pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` is reset to 0. The values of `beautiful_count`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged from their previous states. The only change is that `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is now 0.
