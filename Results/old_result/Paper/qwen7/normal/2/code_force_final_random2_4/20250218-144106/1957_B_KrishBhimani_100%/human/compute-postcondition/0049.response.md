For the given `while True` loop, the loop will always execute at least once because it is an infinite loop. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the initial state to allow the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1**
