Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `total_costs` now contains the sum of costs from index `i + 1` to `i + k`.
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `k` retains its previous value.
- The latest sum is appended to `total_costs`.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again, so `i` will be `i + 2`.

2. **Variable `k`:**
   - `k` retains its previous value, so it remains unchanged.

3. **Variable `total_costs`:**
   - The state of `total_costs` is updated by appending the latest sum, but this is not part of the loop head. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `total_costs` here.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `i + 2` must still be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is `i + 2`.
- `k` retains its previous value.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i + 2` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total_costs` now contains the sum of costs from index `i + 2` to `i + k`, `i` is now `i + 2`, and `k` retains its previous value.**

In a more concise form:
State: **`total_costs` now contains the sum of costs from index `i + 2` to `i + k`, `i` is now `i + 2`, and `k` retains its previous value.**
