Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least one element; `cnt[a[x]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] += 1` increments the count of the value `x` in the dictionary `cnt`. However, the specific value of `x` is not provided, and it is assumed to be an element from the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers and must have at least one element, `x` is one of those elements. The count of the integer `x` in the dictionary `cnt` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions of `a` and `cnt` remain unchanged except for the increment in the count of `x` in `cnt`.
