Output State: **The program returns True**

Given the initial state, `sortedPassword` is a string formed by concatenating `digits` and `letters` up to index `i-1`, where `i` is equal to the length of `digits`. This means that `sortedPassword` now contains all the characters from both `digits` and `letters`. Since the code simply returns `True`, the program returns the boolean value `True`.
