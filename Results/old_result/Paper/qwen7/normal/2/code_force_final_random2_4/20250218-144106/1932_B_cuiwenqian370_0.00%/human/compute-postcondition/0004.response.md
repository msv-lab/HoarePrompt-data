Output State: **`t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `data`, or `index`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new variable `results` is introduced as an empty list.
