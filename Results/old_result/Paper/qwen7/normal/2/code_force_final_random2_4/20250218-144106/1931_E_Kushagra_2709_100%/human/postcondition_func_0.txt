The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of integers in the list), `m` (an integer determining when Sasha wins), and `nums` (a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). It calculates the total length of the string representations of all integers in `nums`, sorts a list of their zero counts in descending order, and then subtracts the sum of every second element in this sorted list from a cumulative total. Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the resulting total is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.
