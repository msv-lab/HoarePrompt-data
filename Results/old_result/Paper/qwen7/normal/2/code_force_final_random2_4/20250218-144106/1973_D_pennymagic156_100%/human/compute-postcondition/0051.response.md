Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `cnt` is 1, `l` is less than `n + 1`**

Explanation: The code `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` by adding 1 to the result of `func_2()`. The initial state of `l` was `func_2() + 1`, so this operation does not change the value of `l` but ensures that `l` remains less than `n + 1` as per the precondition. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
