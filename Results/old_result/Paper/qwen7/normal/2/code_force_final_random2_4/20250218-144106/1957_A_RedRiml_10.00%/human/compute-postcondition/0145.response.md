Output State: **`shapes` is 2, `pl` must have at least one element, `j` is the current index plus 1, and the new value of `d[j]` (which is `d[j+1]`) is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code `shapes += 1` increments the value of `shapes` by 1. Initially, `shapes` is 1, so after executing the code, `shapes` becomes 2. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
