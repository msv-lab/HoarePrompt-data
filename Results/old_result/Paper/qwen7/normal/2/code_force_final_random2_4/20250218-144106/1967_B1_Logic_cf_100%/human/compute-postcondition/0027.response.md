Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `b` is greater than or equal to 4 after 3 iterations.
   - `n` and `m` are such that `min(n, m)` is at least 4.
   - `ans` is the sum of the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each `b` from 2 to the final value of `b`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.

3. **Current State**:
   - After 3 iterations, `b` is 4.
   - `ans` contains the cumulative sum of \((n + 2) // 4\), \((n + 3) // 9\), and \((n + 4) // 16\).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue until `b` exceeds `min(n, m)`.
   - Since `b` is currently 4, the loop will continue if `min(n, m)` is greater than 4.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `T` and `b`.
   - `T` is the loop counter and will increment by 1.
   - `b` will increment by 1 in each iteration.

Given that the loop will continue if `min(n, m)` is greater than 4, we need to ensure that `b` is incremented and check the condition for the next iteration.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `T` will be incremented by 1.
- `b` will be incremented by 1, so `b` will be 5.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `min(n, m)` must still be at least 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`b` is 5, `n` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 5, `m` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 5, `ans` is the sum of the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each `b` from 2 to 4.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`b` is 5, `n` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 5, `m` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 5, `ans` is the sum of the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of \((n + 2) // 4\), \((n + 3) // 9\), and \((n + 4) // 16\)**.
