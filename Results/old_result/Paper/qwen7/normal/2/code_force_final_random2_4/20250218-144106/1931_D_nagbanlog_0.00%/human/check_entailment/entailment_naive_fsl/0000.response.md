Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` values. According to the problem description, a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if:

1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

However, the program attempts to find pairs where the individual elements \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) satisfy certain modular conditions, which is not equivalent to the required conditions. For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

This is because the pairs \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\) and \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\) are beautiful as explained in the example. However, the provided program does not correctly identify these pairs. Instead, it seems to be checking for pairs where the elements themselves satisfy certain modular conditions, which is not the intended logic.

To fix this, the program should directly check for pairs \((i, j)\) such that:

- \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
- \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)

This requires iterating through all possible pairs and checking these conditions directly, rather than relying on modular arithmetic to infer the conditions.
