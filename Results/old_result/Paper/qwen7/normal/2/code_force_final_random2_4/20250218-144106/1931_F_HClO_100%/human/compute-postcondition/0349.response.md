Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `p1`, or `p2`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
