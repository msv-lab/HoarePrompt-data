You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). It calculates and prints the result based on the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) for each test case. Specifically, it finds the minimum value between \( n \) and \( b - a \) and uses it to compute and print either \( a \times n \) or \( b \times k - k \times (k - 1) / 2 + (n - k) \times a \), depending on whether \( b \) is less than or equal to \( a \) or not. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the final values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) corresponding to the last input test case, and \( k \) being the minimum value between the final \( n \) and \( b - a \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling \( n \) buns.
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price of \( b - i + 1 \) coins for the \( i \)-th bun.
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \) coins each.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It calculates \( k \) as the minimum of \( n \) and \( b - a \).
   - If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \) (since no bun should be sold at a lower price).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula \( b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).

3. **Checking the Formula:**
   - The term \( b \times k \) represents the total revenue from the first \( k \) buns.
   - The term \( -\frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \) accounts for the decreasing price of each subsequent bun.
   - The term \( (n - k) \times a \) represents the total revenue from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \( b \leq a \), the formula simplifies to \( a \times n \), which is correct.
   - When \( b > a \), the formula correctly accounts for the decreasing price and the usual price.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic in the code matches the problem statement and the examples provided.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given conditions.
