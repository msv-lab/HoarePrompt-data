Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is an odd number, `pk` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n // 2` to the variable `pk`. Since `n` is an odd number, `n // 2` represents the integer division of `n` by 2, which results in an integer value. The other variables remain unchanged.
