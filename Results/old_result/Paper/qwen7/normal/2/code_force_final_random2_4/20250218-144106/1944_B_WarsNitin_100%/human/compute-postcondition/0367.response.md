Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans1` has the element `l[0]` and `l[i]` appended to it, `ans2` has the elements `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[3]` appended to it, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element `l[i]` (which is `l[3]` since `i` is 3) to the list `ans2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
