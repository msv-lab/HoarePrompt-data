Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state describes that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is equal to `k`, and `k` is an input integer. The value of `n` is also stated to be greater than or equal to `k`. However, the `print` statement only outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`. Therefore, the output will be `1`.
