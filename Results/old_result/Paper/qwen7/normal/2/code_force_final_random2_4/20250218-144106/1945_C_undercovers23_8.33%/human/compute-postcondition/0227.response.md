Output State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `pk` and `mini` are defined such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`; `final` now contains the element `elem`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` to the list `final`. The conditions and values of `lst`, `pk`, and `mini` remain unchanged. Therefore, `lst` still has at least one element, `pk` and `mini` are still defined such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, and `final` now includes the element `elem`.
