The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts consecutive segments of alternating '0's and '1's in the string `s`, excluding the last segment if it ends with '1'. If any such segment is found, it decrements the count by one. The function prints the final count for each test case.
