Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `bets`. The loop condition is `i < bets`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `bets` must be greater than 0.
   - `prod` is updated to `prod * a[i]` at each iteration.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = bets - 1`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < bets`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `bets - 1` because the loop runs until `i` is less than `bets`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented to `bets`.
   - The value of `bets` remains the same unless it changes outside the loop, but since no such change is mentioned, `bets` stays the same.

5. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `bets`.
   - The value of `bets` remains unchanged.
   - The product `prod` is updated to `prod * a[i]` where `i` is now `bets - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `prod` is updated to `prod * a[bets - 1]`, `i` is `bets`**.
