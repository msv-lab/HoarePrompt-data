Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The code `freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1` increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. The other variables (`beautiful_count`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The precondition that `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq` or not does not change the fact that `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented, and `beautiful_count` is updated based on the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.
