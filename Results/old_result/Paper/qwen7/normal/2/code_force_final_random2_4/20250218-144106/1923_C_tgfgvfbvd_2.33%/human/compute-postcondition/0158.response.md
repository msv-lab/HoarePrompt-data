Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by inputs including a positive integer `t`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries each defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, it checks the sum of elements in the sublist of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` and returns the results accordingly.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a list of integers and a set of queries. It processes each query by calculating the sum of a specified range within the list and returns the sums for all queries.
