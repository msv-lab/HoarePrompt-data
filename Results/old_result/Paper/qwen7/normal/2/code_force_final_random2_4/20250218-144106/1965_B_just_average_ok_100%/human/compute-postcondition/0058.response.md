Output State: **`i` is 20, `len(nums)` is 21, `idx` is either -1 or a value between 0 and 19, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums[-1]` is `2097151`, `nums` is a list of 21 elements where each element is a power of 2 starting from 1 to \(2^{20}\)**.

Explanation: The code replaces the existing `nums` list with a new list generated using a list comprehension. The new list contains 21 elements, which are powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). The last element of the new `nums` list is \(2^{20}\), which equals 1048576. Therefore, `nums[-1]` is updated to 1048576 + 1 = 1048577, but since `nums` is redefined, the correct value is \(2^{20} = 1048576\). All other variables (`i`, `len(nums)`, `idx`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged.
