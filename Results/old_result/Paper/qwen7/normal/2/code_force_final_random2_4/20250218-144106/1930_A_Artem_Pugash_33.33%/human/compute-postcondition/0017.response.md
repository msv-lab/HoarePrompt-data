Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` has at least one element less than before, `a` is the first element of `numbers` before popping, `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping, `suma` is `suma + min(a, b)` where `b` is the new value of `numbers[0]` after popping, `b` is int(numbers.pop(0)) and `suma` is updated by adding the minimum of `a` and `b` to its current value.**

In more detail: The value of `suma` is updated by adding the minimum of `a` (the first element of `numbers` before popping) and `b` (the first element of `numbers` after popping) to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
