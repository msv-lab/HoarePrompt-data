Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `a` is a list containing at least one element (excluding the first element).
- `sz` is the second element in the original list `a`.
- If `sz` equals `mexsize` (which is `sz + 1`), no changes are made to the list `a`.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` using the variable `sz`.

### End of Previous Iteration
- `a` is a list containing at least one element (excluding the first element).
- `sz` is the second element in the original list `a`.

### Conditions for Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute again, `sz` must be the next element in the list `a`.
- Since `sz` was the second element in the original list, the next element in the list `a` would be the third element.

### Adjusting States
- The only variable in the loop head is `sz`, so we need to adjust this variable to the next element in the list `a`.
- The list `a` itself does not change unless `sz` equals `mexsize` and no changes are made.

### New State
- `a` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
- `sz` becomes the third element in the original list `a`.

### Final Answer
State: **`a` is a list containing at least one element (excluding the first element), and `sz` is the third element in the original list `a`.**
