You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
    #
    #In this final output state, the loop has executed for each character in the binary string `sChar`. The variable `s` now contains a list of all characters from `sChar`, in the order they appeared.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`, `cost` is 16, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `right` will be equal to the length of the list `s`. This is because the loop continues to increment `right` as long as `right` is less than the length of `s` and `s[right]` is not '0'. Once `right` reaches the length of `s` or `s[right]` becomes '0', the condition `right < len(s) and s[right] != '0'` fails, and the loop terminates. The loop also increments `cost` by the value of `right - left + 1` each time it swaps a '0' and '1' and updates `left` and `right` accordingly. Since the loop runs three more times after the initial three iterations, and the cost doubles each time based on the problem's pattern, the final `cost` will be \(2^4 = 16\). The values of `sChar`, `i`, `s`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged from their final state after the third iteration, where `left` and `right` are both equal to the length of the list `s`.
    return cost
    #The program returns a cost of 16
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `sChar` and performs a series of swaps to ensure that all '1's are moved to the left side of the string while all '0's are moved to the right side. During this process, it calculates and returns a cost value of 16.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not handle all cases correctly. For instance, consider the input string `101011`. The expected output is 9, but the current implementation does not achieve this result. Here is a breakdown of why the current implementation fails:

1. The current implementation tries to swap characters based on the condition `if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1'`, which is not sufficient to cover all possible scenarios for achieving the minimum cost.
2. The logic for finding the next '0' and '1' positions and swapping them is flawed because it does not account for the cyclic nature of the shifts and the optimal way to minimize the total cost.

A correct approach would involve identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculating the cost of making the rest of the string sorted through cyclic shifts. This requires a more sophisticated algorithm that considers the cyclic nature of the shifts and the optimal way to minimize the total cost.
