The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) and two non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates a modified value of \( t \) based on the given \( a \) and \( b \), and prints the final value of \( t \) after applying specific conditions. The final value of \( t \) reflects the cumulative effect of these calculations across all test cases.
