Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `m` is the second input integer.
- `k` is the third input integer.
- `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

The `print(result)` statement will print the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise value of `result`. However, we know it is the result of applying `func_1` with the given parameters.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
