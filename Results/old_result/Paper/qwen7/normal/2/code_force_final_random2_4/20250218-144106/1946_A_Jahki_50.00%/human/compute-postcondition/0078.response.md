Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, num)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < num`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `op` is incremented multiple times.
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`.
   - `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`.
   - `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`.
   - `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, with `new_median` being incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `num`, we need to adjust these values.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented, so let's assume `i` was `k` before the last iteration and now it is `k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `num`. Therefore, `i` should be `k + 1` and `num` should remain the same.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `op` is incremented multiple times (unchanged).
   - `total` remains 0 (unchanged).
   - `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits (unchanged).
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median` (unchanged).
   - `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b` (unchanged).
   - `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2` (unchanged).
   - `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, with `new_median` being incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median` (unchanged).

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`op` is incremented multiple times, `total` remains 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, and `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, with `new_median` being incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `num` remains the same.**

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, the final state is:

State: **`op` is incremented multiple times, `total` remains 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, and `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, with `new_median` being incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `num` remains the same.**
