Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4.
   - `y` is an integer input from the user.
   - `list0` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
   - `i` is `x - 2`.
   - `num` is `n - list0[-1]`.
   - If `num` equals 1, then `count` is incremented to `x`.

2. **Value of `count`:**
   - From the postcondition, `count` is equal to `x`.

3. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly defined as `x - 2`.

4. **Value of `num`:**
   - `num` is defined as `n - list0[-1]`, where `list0[-1]` is the last element of the sorted list `list0`.

5. **Condition for incrementing `count`:**
   - If `num` equals 1, then `count` is set to `x`. Otherwise, it remains `x`.

6. **Expression to be printed:**
   - The expression to be printed is `count + x - 2`.

Given that `count` is equal to `x`, the expression simplifies to:
\[ \text{count} + x - 2 = x + x - 2 = 2x - 2 \]

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we express the final result in terms of `x`.

Output: **2x - 2**
