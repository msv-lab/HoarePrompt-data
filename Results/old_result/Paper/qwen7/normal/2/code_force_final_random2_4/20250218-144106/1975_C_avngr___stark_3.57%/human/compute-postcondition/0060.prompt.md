Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
            max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `max` is the maximum value between any two consecutive elements in the list `a` if `min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max` was true for any iteration, otherwise `max` remains the initial value (0).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: t is an integer between 2 and 500, i equals n, n is the input integer, a is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, max is the maximum value between any two consecutive elements in the list a, and this maximum value is the largest minimum value found between any two consecutive elements during the entire execution of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the minimum value between `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`, and if `min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max` for any `i` in the range of 1 to `n-1`, then `max` is updated accordingly.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
