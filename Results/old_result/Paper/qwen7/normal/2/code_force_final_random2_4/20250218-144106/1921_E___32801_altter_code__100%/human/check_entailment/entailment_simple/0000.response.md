Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the board dimensions and initial positions of the chips.
2. **Base Case for Bob**: When Bob is in the first row (`x2 <= x1`), the game immediately ends in a draw. This is handled correctly.
3. **Odd Difference in Rows**: When the difference in rows between Bob and Alice is odd, the program checks if Alice can move to the same column as Bob. If so, Alice wins. If not, it calculates the necessary moves to align Alice's and Bob's positions, ensuring Alice can eventually win if possible.
4. **Even Difference in Rows**: When the difference in rows between Bob and Alice is even, similar logic is applied but with different conditions for winning. If Alice can force Bob into a position where he cannot avoid a draw, Bob wins; otherwise, the game ends in a draw.
5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**: The program handles edge cases like out-of-bound moves and ensures that all conditions are checked correctly before printing the result.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided solution appears to handle all the specified conditions and constraints correctly.

Correctness: **True**
