Output State: **`t` is 1, `T` remains as the initial positive integer, `info` is a list of strings split from the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer, and `suma` remains the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop's iterations until `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0` for all `i` in the range 1 to `b`.**

Explanation: The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `info`. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `a`, `b`, and `suma`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
