Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in no`. This means the loop variable `i` is taken from the list `no`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the next element in the list `no`.
   - `no` must contain at least one element.
   - `less` is a list with a minimum value.
   - `big` is a list with a maximum value.
   - `num` is decremented by 1.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in the list `no`, after the current iteration, `i` will be set to the next element in `no`.
   - For the loop to continue, `no` must still contain at least one element. If `no` becomes empty, the loop will terminate.
   - The lists `less` and `big` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `num` is already decremented by 1, so it does not need further adjustment.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be set to the next element in `no`.
   - `no` must still contain at least one element.
   - `less` remains unchanged.
   - `big` remains unchanged.
   - `num` remains decremented by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is the next element in the list `no`, `no` must contain at least one element, `less` is a list with a minimum value, `big` is a list with a maximum value, and `num` is decremented by 1**.
