Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in costs:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `costs`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on the values from the list `costs` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `costs`: This is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the `costs` list.
   - Since `costs` contains exactly two elements, the loop will execute twice.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the `costs` list is correctly initialized with the given elements.
   - We don't need to change the value of `h` or `n` or `k` since they are not used in the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the `costs` list to ensure it contains the correct elements.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`**
