Output State: **After the loop executes all 30 iterations, `i` will be 29, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. Each element in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^i\) (where \(i\) ranges from 0 to 29) is true, and '0' otherwise.**

This means that `s` will contain the binary representation of the integer `x`, where each bit corresponds to whether \(x\) has the respective power of 2 as a factor. The list `s` will start with the least significant bit (rightmost) and end with the most significant bit (leftmost).
