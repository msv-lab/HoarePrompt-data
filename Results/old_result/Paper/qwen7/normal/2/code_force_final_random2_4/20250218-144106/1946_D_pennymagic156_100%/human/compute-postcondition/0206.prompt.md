You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, x is an integer such that 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and a is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n.
def func_5():
    n, x = func_3()
    a = func_1()
    t, ans = [], -1
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
        
        if u == v == 0:
            continue
        
        if u == 0:
            if v % 2:
                return ans
            else:
                op = ai = 0
                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                a, t = t, []
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                if not op:
                    cnt += 1
            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum value found during the loop execution, `i` is 0, `u` is `a[0] >> 0 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 0 & 1) for val in a]`.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop (from 29 down to 0), the list `t` remains empty because no elements were appended to it throughout the loop's execution. The variable `ans` holds the highest value among all counts of consecutive zeros found in the binary representation of the elements in `a`, as determined by the loop. The variable `i` reaches 0 after the last iteration. The variable `u` is the least significant bit of the first element in `a`, and `v` is the sum of the least significant bits of all elements in `a`.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between ans and the length of list a.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes variables `u` and `v` which are initially set to 0. Based on certain conditions, it returns -1, 0, or the maximum value between -1 or 0 and the length of list `a`. If both `u` and `v` are 0, no changes are made to these variables; otherwise, `ans` remains either -1 or 0. Finally, it returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of list `a`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns -1 or 0 based on whether both `u` and `v` are 0

Case_3: The program returns -1 or 0 based on the condition that if both u and v are 0, no changes are made to the variables; otherwise, ans remains either -1 or 0.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between ans and the length of list a.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
