Based on the initial state provided:

- `num` is defined as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.
- `no` is a list containing all values of `a` that were not 1 or 2.
- `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where the corresponding `x` was 2.
- `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where the corresponding `x` was 1.
- The value of `num` is explicitly stated to be less than 1.

Given that `num` is less than 1, it means `num` must be 0 because it's an integer (as implied by the context).

The print statement is:
```python
print(0)
```

This will directly print the integer 0.

Output: **0**
