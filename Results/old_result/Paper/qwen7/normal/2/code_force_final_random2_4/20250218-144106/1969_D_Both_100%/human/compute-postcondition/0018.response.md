Postcondition: **`current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is a positive integer, `heap` is a list containing the last element of `combined` pushed into it, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` must be greater than 1, `max_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order.** 

This postcondition retains the initial state of all variables as described in the precondition, since the if condition is not specified and the else part does not change any of the variables' states.
