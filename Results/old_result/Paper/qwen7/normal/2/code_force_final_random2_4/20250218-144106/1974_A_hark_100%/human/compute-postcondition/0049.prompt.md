Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for k in range(ap):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer, `k` must be between 0 and `ap`-1 (inclusive), `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` <= 0 else the ceiling value of `x` divided by 15 if `x > 0` and `y > 0`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is greater than 0, `x` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `bxsfory` * 15 + `y` * 4, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0 else the ceiling of `x` divided by 15. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `ap`, `k`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is 1. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 <= 0` else the ceiling value of `(x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15`. If `x == 0` and `y > 0`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
