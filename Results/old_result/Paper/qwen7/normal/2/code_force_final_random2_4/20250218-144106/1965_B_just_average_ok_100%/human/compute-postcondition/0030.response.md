Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `nums` is a list containing the first 21 powers of 2 starting from 2^0**.

The code creates a list `nums` using a list comprehension. The list comprehension `(1 << i) for i in range(21)` generates 21 elements, each being a power of 2, starting from \(2^0\) (which is 1) up to \(2^{20}\). The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
