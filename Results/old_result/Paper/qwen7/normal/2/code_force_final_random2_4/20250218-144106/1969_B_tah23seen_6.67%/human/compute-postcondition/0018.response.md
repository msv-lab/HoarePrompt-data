Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'`.

2. **Analyze the initial state**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is 1.
   - `cost` is 2.
   - `right` is 0.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `right` must be less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` must not be '0'.
   - Since `right` is initially 0, `right < len(s)` is already satisfied because `len(s)` is at least 1 (since `sChar` is a non-empty binary string).
   - We need to ensure that `s[right]` (which is `s[0]`) is not '0'. If `s[0]` is '0', the loop will not execute the first time.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `s[0]` to ensure it is not '0'.

Therefore, the modified state right before the loop should be:

**State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is 0, and `s[0]` is not '0'**.
