Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 2, `x` is 2, `s` is a string slice from `a[0]` from index 0 to index 3 (inclusive) concatenated with a slice from `a[1]` starting from index 2, and `t` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
        t = x - i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string slice from `a[0]` from index 0 to index 3 (inclusive) concatenated with a slice from `a[1]` starting from index 2, `t` is 2, and if `a[0][:i + 1]` equals `s[:i + 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is 'aa2', `t` is 2. If `a[0][:i + 1]` equals `s[:i + 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4, `x` must be greater than 4, and `t` is set to `x - 4 + 1`. If the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
