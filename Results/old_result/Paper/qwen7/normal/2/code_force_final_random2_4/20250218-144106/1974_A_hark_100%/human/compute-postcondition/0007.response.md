Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer, `k` must be between 0 and `ap`-1 (inclusive), `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` <= 0 else the ceiling value of `x` divided by 15.**

This means that `bxsfory1` is calculated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` is set to 0. Otherwise, `bxsfory1` is set to the ceiling value of `x` divided by 15. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
