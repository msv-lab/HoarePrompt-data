Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no' and 'yes' appended, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contains the string `'no'`. After appending `'yes'`, `results` becomes a list containing both `'no'` and `'yes'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
