You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
For each test case, the function reads three integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \). It then finds the maximum integer \( i \) such that \( x \% i == 0 \) (i.e., \( i \) is a divisor of \( x \)) and \( n \leq x // i \). Finally, it prints this maximum value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not called properly within the loop. It should be called with the appropriate arguments.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program correctly reads the values of `x` and `n` for each test case.

4. **Finding Maximum Balance:**
   - The program attempts to find the maximum balance by iterating through potential divisors of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, it updates the answer `ans` with the maximum value between `ans` and `i`.
   - It also checks the condition where `n` is less than or equal to `i`, updating `ans` with the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum balance found for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The function `func_1()` is defined but not called correctly within the main loop. The call to `func_1()` should be inside the loop that processes each test case.
- The logic for finding the maximum balance seems correct, but the implementation of the function `func_1()` needs to be called properly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import isqrt

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(x, n)

def func_1(x, n):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has an issue with calling the function `func_1()`. Once this is corrected, the program should work as intended.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
