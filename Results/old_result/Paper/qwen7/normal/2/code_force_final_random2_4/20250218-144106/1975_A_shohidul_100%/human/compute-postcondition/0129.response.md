Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `i` is currently 2 (as given in the postcondition).
   - `n` is an input integer (its value is not specified but it must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue).

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Postcondition After the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` will remain the same (greater than 3).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 3**.
