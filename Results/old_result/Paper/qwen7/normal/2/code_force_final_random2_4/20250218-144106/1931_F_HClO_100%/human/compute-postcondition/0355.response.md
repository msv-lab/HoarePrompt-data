Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Additionally, the elements at indices `i + p1` in lists `l1` and `i + p2` in lists `l2` are equal to `a2` and `a1` respectively.
