Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b` // 2 or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated by adding `t2 // 15` to its current value. Since `t2` is divisible by 15, `t2 // 15` is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
