Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` equals 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code, we assume it breaks out of an implied loop or conditional. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
