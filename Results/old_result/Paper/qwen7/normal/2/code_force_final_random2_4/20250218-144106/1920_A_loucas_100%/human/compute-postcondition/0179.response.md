Postcondition: `no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2 (excluding `i_current`). If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, `num` is decremented by 1. If the condition is not met, `num` remains unchanged.
