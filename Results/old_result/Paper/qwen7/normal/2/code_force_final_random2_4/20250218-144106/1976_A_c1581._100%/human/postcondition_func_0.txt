The function `func_1` accepts a password string and processes it by separating digits and letters into two lists. It then sorts these lists. If the sorted combination of digits and letters matches the original password and certain conditions are met (no adjacent digits are out of order and no digit is greater than the last letter), the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
