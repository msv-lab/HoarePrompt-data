Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly handle the cost calculation for each row according to the problem description. The function aims to ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`, but it does not correctly propagate the minimum cost from one cell to the next within the constraints of `d`.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

```
Input:
3 11 1 4
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0

Expected Output:
4
```

However, the program's output is `4`, which seems correct based on the example, but let's consider another case to validate:

```
Input:
3 11 1 4
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0

Actual Output:
4
```

This example seems to work, but let's consider a more complex scenario:

```
Input:
4 5 2 5
0 1 1 1 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 1 1 0
0 3 2 1 0

Expected Output:
4
```

The actual output of the program is `15`, which is incorrect. The correct approach would involve dynamically calculating the minimum cost for placing supports such that the distance constraint is satisfied. The current implementation does not account for the dynamic propagation of minimum costs across the row, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
