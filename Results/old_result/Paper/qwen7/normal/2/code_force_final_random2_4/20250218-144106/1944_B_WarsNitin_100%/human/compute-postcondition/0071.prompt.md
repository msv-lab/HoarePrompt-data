Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is either twice the original value of `k` or `k` is twice the original value of `k` minus 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements sorted in ascending order, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, and `c` is sorted in ascending order; `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the element `b[n - 1]` appended, `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to `k`; `l` is a list containing the value of `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` equals 0. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` appended with `b[i]`, which is `b[1]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` contains the element `b[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` equals 0, and if `b[2]` is equal to `b[3]`, then `l` contains the element `b[2]`. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged, and `ans1` contains the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` equals 0, `l` contains either the elements `b[3]` and `b[3]` (if `b[3]` equals `b[2]`) or `[b[3]]` (if `b[3]` does not equal `b[2]`), and `ans1` contains the elements `b[3]` and `b[3]` if `b[3]` equals `b[2]`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
