Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the first integer from user input, `b` is the second integer from user input**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input (using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`) and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 1.
