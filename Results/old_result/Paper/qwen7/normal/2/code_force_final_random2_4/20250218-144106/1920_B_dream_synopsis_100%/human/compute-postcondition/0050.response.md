Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, and `ans` will contain `k + 2` elements, each being the value of `sums` after each iteration from 0 to `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits them into a list `a`. The variables `i`, `sums`, and `ans` remain in their previous states except that `a` now holds the list of integers. The values of `i`, `sums`, and `ans` will be updated in subsequent code execution, but based on the given information, we only know the initial conditions for these variables.
