Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of integers representing a strictly increasing sequence where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100, and `b`, a list of integers where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100. It returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a` if the elements in `b` are not considered. If the elements in `b` are considered, it returns a list of integers representing the values \(n_i\) where \(1 \leq n_i \leq 100\).**
