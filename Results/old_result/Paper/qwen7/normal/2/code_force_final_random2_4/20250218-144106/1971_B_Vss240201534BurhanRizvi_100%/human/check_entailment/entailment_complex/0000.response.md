Reasoning:
- The function correctly handles the case where the string `s` has a single character, printing "No".
- It also correctly handles the case where `s` consists of identical characters and has more than one character, by rotating `s` one character to the left and printing "Yes" followed by the modified string.
- For all other cases, the function generates a random permutation of `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`, which ensures that the resulting string `s2` is different from `s` unless `s` consists of unique characters.
- The function correctly prints "Yes" before printing the permuted string `s2`.

Given these observations, the function appears to follow the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
