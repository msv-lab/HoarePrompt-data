Output State: **`dp[i]' is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i - 1]' and `dp[i - 2]' plus 1 if `path[i]' is '@', otherwise it is just the maximum of `dp[i - 1]' and `dp[i - 2]'**.

This means that the value of `dp[i]` is determined by taking the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`, and then adding 1 if the character at index `i` in the `path` string is '@', otherwise no additional value is added. All other variables remain in their previous state.
