Output State: **`s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `t` is the number of test cases such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `pre` is a list of integers where each element is (i + 1) for every index i where s1[i] == '>'; `totalOne` is the length of the list `pre`; `preOne` is a list obtained by taking the prefix sum of the list `pre` with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `suffZero` as a list containing a single element, which is 0. This does not affect the values of `s1`, `t`, `pre`, `totalOne`, or `preOne`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values and conditions.
