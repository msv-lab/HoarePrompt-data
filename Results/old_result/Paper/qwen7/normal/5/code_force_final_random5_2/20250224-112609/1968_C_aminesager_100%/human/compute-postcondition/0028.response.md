Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `a` has its last element updated to the sum of the second last element of `a` and the element at index `i-1` of `T`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to list `a`, which is the sum of `a[i - 1]` (the second last element of `a`) and `T[i - 1]` (the element at index `i-1` of `T`). The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
