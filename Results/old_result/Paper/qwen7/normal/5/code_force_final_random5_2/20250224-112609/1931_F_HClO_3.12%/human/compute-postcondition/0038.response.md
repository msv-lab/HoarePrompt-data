Postcondition: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `l11` is 0, `l22` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is either equal to `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)` (if the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is true) or `i` remains unchanged (if the condition is false), and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and (`l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`)**
