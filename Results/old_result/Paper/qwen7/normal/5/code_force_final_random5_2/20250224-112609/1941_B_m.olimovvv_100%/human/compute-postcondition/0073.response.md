Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `b[i + 1]` is decreased by 2 times the value of `b[i]`.
- `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of `b[i]`.
- `b[i]` is 0.

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(0, a - 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = a - 3` (since `a - 2` is the upper limit).
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable that changes within the loop is `i`.

### Adjusting States
- **i**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (let's say `i = k`). For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i = k + 1`.
- **b[i]**: The state of `b[i]` is already given as 0.
- **b[i + 1]** and **b[i + 2]**: These values will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

### New Values
- Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
- Therefore, `b[i + 1]` becomes `b[k + 2]` and `b[i + 2]` becomes `b[k + 3]`.

### Updated State
- `b[k + 1]` is decreased by 2 times the value of `b[k]`.
- `b[k + 2]` is decreased by the value of `b[k]`.
- `b[k]` is already 0.

Since `b[k]` is 0, the updates to `b[k + 1]` and `b[k + 2]` will be:
- `b[k + 1]` remains unchanged (as it is decreased by 0).
- `b[k + 2]` remains unchanged (as it is decreased by 0).

### Final State
- `b[i + 1]` (which is now `b[k + 2]`) is unchanged.
- `b[i + 2]` (which is now `b[k + 3]`) is unchanged.
- `b[i]` is still 0.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`b[i + 1]` is unchanged, `b[i + 2]` is unchanged, `b[i]` is 0**.
