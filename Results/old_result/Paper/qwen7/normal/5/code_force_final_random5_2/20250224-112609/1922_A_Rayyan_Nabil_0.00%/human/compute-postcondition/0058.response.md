Postcondition: `i` is less than `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is 'YES', `c` is an input string, `n` must be a positive integer, and either `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to the current value of `c[i]`, or the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is false.
