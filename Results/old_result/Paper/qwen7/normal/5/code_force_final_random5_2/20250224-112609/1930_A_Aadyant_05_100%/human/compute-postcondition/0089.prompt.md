You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all its iterations will be as follows:
    #
    #- `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, as it was not affected by the loop.
    #- `n` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, as it was not modified inside the loop.
    #- `final` is a list that contains the sum of every second element from each `list2` created during the loop's iterations, starting from the first element of each `list2`. This means `final` will contain the sum of every second element from the first `list2`, then the sum of every second element from the second `list2`, and so on, for all iterations of the loop.
    #
    #This output state reflects the cumulative sum of every second element from each `list2` created during the loop's execution, with the sums being stored in the `final` list.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: `final` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. For each test case, it returns a result based on the given integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
