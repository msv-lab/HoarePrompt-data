#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and two strings of length n, where each string consists only of '<' and '>' characters.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        
        if reachable_second_row:

    #State: Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether `reachable_second_row` becomes True for any test case. If `reachable_second_row` becomes True for any test case, the corresponding entry in `results` will be 'YES'; otherwise, it will be 'NO'. The values of `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `n`, and `j` will reflect the final state of the last executed test case, but since the loop processes each test case independently, these values may vary between different entries in the `results` list. The `results` list will have a length equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`.
    #
    #In more detail:
    #- `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will be set based on the conditions met during the last iteration of the loop for the last test case.
    #- `n` will be the `n` value of the last test case processed.
    #- `j` will be `n - 1`, as the inner loop always checks up to `n - 1`.
    #- `results` will contain one 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether `reachable_second_row` was made True for that specific test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list called `results` that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. Each entry in the list indicates whether `reachable_second_row` became True for that specific test case. The length of the list is equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`. For the last test case, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` reflect the final state, `n` is the `n` value of the last test case, and `j` is `n - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and two strings of length `n`, consisting only of '<' and '>' characters. It returns a list called `results` that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether `reachable_second_row` became True for that specific test case. The length of the list matches the number of test cases in `test_cases`. For each test case, the function checks if it's possible to reach the second row from the first row following the directions given by the strings `row1` and `row2`.
