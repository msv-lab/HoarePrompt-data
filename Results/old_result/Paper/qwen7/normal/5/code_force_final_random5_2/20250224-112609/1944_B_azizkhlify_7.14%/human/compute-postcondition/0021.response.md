Output State: `res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is `2 * n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`, incrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration. For each value of `i`, the element `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. Since the loop runs `n` times (from `n` to `2 * n - 1` inclusive), each `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented `n` times. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `2 * n`, and each `r[a[i] - 1]` will have been incremented `n` times.
