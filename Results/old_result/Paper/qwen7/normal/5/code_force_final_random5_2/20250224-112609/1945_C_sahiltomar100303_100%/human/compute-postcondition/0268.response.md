Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - 1`, and `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `left` remains 0, `leftZero` stays either 0 or 1, `rightZero` remains unchanged as it is the count of '0's in the specified substring, `rightOne` remains less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is still less than `n`, `tleftZero` becomes 1, `trightZero` decreases by 1 if it was greater than `trightZero - 1` previously, and `trightOne` is reduced by 1.
