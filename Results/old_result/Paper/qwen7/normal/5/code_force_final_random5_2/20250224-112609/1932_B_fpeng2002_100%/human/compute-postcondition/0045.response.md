Output State: **`start_year` will be equal to the final value obtained by successively applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the `nums` list, with `x` taking the value of the last index of `nums` after all iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be updated to the final value calculated by successively applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the `nums` list, starting from the first element and moving through to the last element. The variable `x` will be equal to the last index of `nums`, `num_tests` will be reduced to 0 (since it starts as an input integer and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0), and `nums` will be a non-empty list as it was initially provided.
