The initial state provides that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^3\), but this value does not affect the execution of the print statement. The print statement simply outputs the integer 1.

The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` are not relevant to the print statement since it only prints the integer 1.

Output: **1**
