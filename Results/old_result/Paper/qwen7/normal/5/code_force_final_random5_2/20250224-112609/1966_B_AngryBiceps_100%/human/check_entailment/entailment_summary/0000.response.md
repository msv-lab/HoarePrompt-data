Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions related to the first and last rows of the grid. However, the logic used in the program is flawed and does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

1. **Checking Uniformity of Rows**: The program checks if the first and last rows are uniform (all 'W' or all 'B') and distinct from each other. This condition is not sufficient to determine if all squares in the grid can be made the same color. For example, consider a grid where the first row is 'WWBB' and the last row is 'BBBB'. The first and last rows are distinct and uniform, but it is still possible to make all squares the same color by performing the allowed operations.

2. **Lack of General Solution**: The program does not account for the possibility of making all squares the same color through a series of operations that might involve intermediate rows and columns. It only focuses on the first and last rows, which is not a comprehensive approach to solving the problem.

Given these points, the program's logic is incomplete and incorrect. Therefore, the program cannot accurately determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
