You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a single string `inpstr` containing only 'W' and 'B' characters. It finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string. If 'B' is not found, both indices are considered 0. The function then prints the length of the string minus the sum of these two indices.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that, when painted white, will turn all black cells in the strip to white. This means we need to identify the farthest left and right black cells and calculate the distance between them plus one (since the segment includes both endpoints).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - `inpstr = input()` reads a string from the standard input.
   - `ind1` and `ind2` are initialized to 0.
   - The first `for` loop iterates through the string to find the index of the first black cell ('B') and stores it in `ind1`.
   - The second `for` loop iterates from the end of the string to find the index of the last black cell ('B') and stores it in `ind2`.
   - The length of the strip minus `ind2 - 1` minus `ind1` is printed, which does not correctly compute the required segment length.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We should find the first black cell (`ind1`) and the last black cell (`ind2`).
   - The required segment length is `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.

4. **Error in Given Code**:
   - The calculation `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` is incorrect because it does not account for the positions of the black cells relative to each other.
   - The correct calculation should be `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
