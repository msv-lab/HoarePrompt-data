Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` using a list comprehension where each element is calculated as \(2^i\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to 23. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
