Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the last character of `e`, and `q` is not '+', `M` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `M` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other number). Since the initial value of `M` is not specified, we assume it to be 0 for calculation purposes. After executing `M += 1`, `M` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
