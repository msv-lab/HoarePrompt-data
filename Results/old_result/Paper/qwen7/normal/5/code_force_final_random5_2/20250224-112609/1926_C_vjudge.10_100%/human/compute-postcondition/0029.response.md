Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in str(i):`. This means the loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `i`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit.
   - `x` is the current digit being processed.
   - `sum_value_digits` is the original `sum_value_digits` plus the integer value of `x`.
   - `values[i + 1]` is `values[i] + sum_value_digits`.

3. **Understand the loop body**: Although the loop body is omitted, we know that it processes each digit of `i` and updates `sum_value_digits` and `values[i + 1]`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `x` will be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.
   - `sum_value_digits` will be updated to include the integer value of the next digit.
   - `i` will remain the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **State adjustments**:
   - Since `i` remains unchanged, it stays the same.
   - `x` will be the next digit in `str(i)`.
   - `sum_value_digits` will be updated to include the integer value of the next digit.
   - `values[i + 1]` will be updated based on the new value of `sum_value_digits`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` remains the same.
- `x` becomes the next digit in `str(i)`.
- `sum_value_digits` is updated to include the integer value of the next digit.
- `values[i + 1]` is updated based on the new value of `sum_value_digits`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit, `x` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is the original `sum_value_digits` plus the integer value of the next digit, `values[i + 1]` is `values[i] + sum_value_digits`**
