Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the length of `s` is still stored in `n`, and `s` remains unchanged.
