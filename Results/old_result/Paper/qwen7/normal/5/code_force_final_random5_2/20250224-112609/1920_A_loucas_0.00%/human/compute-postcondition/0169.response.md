Based on the initial state provided:

- `innerLoop` must be greater than 0.
- `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`.
- `num` is the maximum value between all elements in the `big` list.
- `num` is not in the `no` list.

The `print(num)` statement will print the value of `num`, which is the maximum value in the `big` list that is not present in the `no` list.

Output: **num (where num is the maximum value in the big list that is not in the no list)**
