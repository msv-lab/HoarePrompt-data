### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The provided solution attempts to construct such an array using a recursive function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Base Case**: When `number == 0`, the function returns `0` and initializes the sequence with an empty list.
   - **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`. This condition ensures that the number of possible increasing subsequences generated by the sequence of numbers up to `size` is sufficient to meet or exceed `number`.
   - **Appending Values**: For each iteration, the loop appends the current index `i` to the sequence. This builds a sequence of numbers from `0` to `size-1`.
   - **Recursive Call**: After the loop, the function makes a recursive call with `number - (1 << size) + 1` to handle the remaining part of `number` that wasn't covered by the current sequence.
   - **Adjusting Sequence**: The loop at the end adjusts the sequence by adding `result` to the appropriate positions, ensuring the sequence meets the required number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - The main program reads the test cases and calls `func_1` to generate the sequence.
   - It prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case when `number == 0`.
   - The loop and recursive calls ensure that the sequence is built to meet the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The adjustment step ensures that the sequence is constructed correctly.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the function.
   - The sequence generation logic is sound and aligns with the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.
