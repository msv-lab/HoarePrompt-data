Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints "Yes".
- If `n` is less than `m`, it prints "No".
- The logic implemented in the `func_1()` function matches the problem statement accurately.
- There are no logical errors or missing steps in the implementation.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
