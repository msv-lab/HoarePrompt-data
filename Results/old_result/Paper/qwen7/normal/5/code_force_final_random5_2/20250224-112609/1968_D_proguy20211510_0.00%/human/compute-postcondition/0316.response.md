Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is the input integer, `ps` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 2, and both `founds` and `foundb` are `True`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `s`. Initially, `i` is 1, so after executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes 2. The value of `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` is appended to `s`, making `s` a list containing one element. All other variables remain unchanged.
