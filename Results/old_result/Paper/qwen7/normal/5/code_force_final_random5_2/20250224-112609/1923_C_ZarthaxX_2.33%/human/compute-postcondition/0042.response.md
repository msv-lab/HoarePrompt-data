Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state does not provide specific values for `onesInRange`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `sumInRange`, but it gives us expressions to understand their relationships.
- The `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string 'NO'.
- Since no specific values are provided for any variables, and the print statement is simply printing a hardcoded string, the output will be exactly 'NO'.
