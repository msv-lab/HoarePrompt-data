Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the conversion correctly for times starting with '12'. Specifically, it incorrectly converts '12:00' to '12:00 PM' instead of '12:00 AM'. This is evident from the example input where '12:00' is given, and the program outputs '12:00 PM' instead of '12:00 AM'. This indicates that the program does not properly distinguish between the AM and PM halves for the '12' hour mark.
