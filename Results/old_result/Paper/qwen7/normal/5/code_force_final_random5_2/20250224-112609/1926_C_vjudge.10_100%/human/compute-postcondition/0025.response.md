Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` in the range from 1 to infinity (`inf`). Therefore, the only variable directly controlled by the loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is a positive integer.
   - `x` is the last digit of `i` after converting `i` to a string and iterating through each character.
   - `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits of `i`.
   - `values[i]` is `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.
   - The value of `x` will be the last digit of the new value of `i`.
   - The value of `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of all digits of the new value of `i`.
   - The value of `values[i]` will be calculated based on the updated `i`.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `x` is the last digit of `i + 1`.
- `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits of `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1, `x` is the last digit of `i + 1`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits of `i + 1`, `values[i + 1]` is `values[i] + sum_value_digits`**
