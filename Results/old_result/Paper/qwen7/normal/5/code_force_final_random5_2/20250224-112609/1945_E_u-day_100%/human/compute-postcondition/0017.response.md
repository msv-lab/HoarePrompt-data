Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `low` and `high` with the values 0 and `n` respectively. The other variables (`pos`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
