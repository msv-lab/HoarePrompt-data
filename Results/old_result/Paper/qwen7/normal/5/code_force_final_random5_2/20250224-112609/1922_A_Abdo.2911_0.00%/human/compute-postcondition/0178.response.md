Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is not lowercase. The current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` in lowercase.**

Explanation: The code sets `match_c` to `False`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and the condition about the characters in `template` and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
