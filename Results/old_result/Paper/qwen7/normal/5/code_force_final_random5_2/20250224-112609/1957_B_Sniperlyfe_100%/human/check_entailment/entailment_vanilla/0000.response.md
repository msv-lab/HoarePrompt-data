Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to generate the sequence of `n` non-negative integers that satisfy the given conditions.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with `n` zeros.
   - The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1.
   - `k` is then reduced by this value.
   - For each subsequent element from index 1 to `n-1`, it sets the value to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`.
   - Finally, it adjusts `nums[0]` to account for any remaining value of `k`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program collects the results of `func_1` for each test case and prints them out in the required format.

### Verification:

1. **Initialization of `nums[0]`:**
   - The value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` is indeed the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1. This is correct.

2. **Subsequent Values:**
   - Setting `nums[i]` to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` ensures that each subsequent number is as large as possible while keeping the total sum `k` and maximizing the bitwise OR result.
   - Adjusting `nums[0]` at the end ensures that the total sum remains `k`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k` is very small, the program will still handle it correctly by setting the remaining values to zero after reducing `k` to zero.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate the sequence of integers that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
