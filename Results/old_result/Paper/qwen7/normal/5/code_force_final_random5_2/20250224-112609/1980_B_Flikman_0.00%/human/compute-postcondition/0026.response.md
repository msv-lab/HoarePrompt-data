Postcondition: `greater_count` is either 1 or 0, `same_value_count` remains unchanged as it equals the total number of times `value` in list `a` matches `favorite_value`, and `a` must have at least one element. If `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, `greater_count` is incremented to 1. Otherwise, `greater_count` remains 0.
