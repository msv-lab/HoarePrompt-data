Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation `p` of size `n` such that after performing a binary search, the element at index `l` is equal to `x`. We can perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

2. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2()`: Reads `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3()`: Reads the permutation `p`.
   - `func_4()` and `func_5()`: These functions are not used in the provided code and thus do not affect the correctness of the solution.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the input using the provided functions.
   - It constructs a dictionary `num_indx` to map each number in the permutation to its index.
   - It initializes `seen` to keep track of visited elements during the binary search.
   - It performs a binary search to find the position where `x` should be placed.
   - If `p[left]` is already `x`, no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is not yet in the permutation, it checks if the current `left` position can be swapped with `x`'s position.
   - If necessary, it finds the first missing element in the `seen` list and swaps it with `x` and then with `left`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The logic ensures that the binary search is performed correctly.
   - The swaps are done in a way that guarantees the final result meets the requirement.
   - The code handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
