Output State: **`j` is 2, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is updated to 2 because the code accesses `eta[j]`, which means `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its current value. Since the initial value of `j` was 1, `eta[j]` refers to `eta[1]`. The precondition that `eta_ln` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
