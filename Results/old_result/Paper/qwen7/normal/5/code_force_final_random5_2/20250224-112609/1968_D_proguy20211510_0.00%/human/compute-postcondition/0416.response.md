Output State: **`i` is 14, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - i - 2`, `ptsb` has an element equal to `preb[12] + (k - 13) * b[12] + preb[13] + (k - 13) * b[13] + preb[14] + (k - 14) * b[14]`, `ptss` is a list with two elements, where the first element is `pres[12] + (k - 14) * s[12]` and the second element is `pres[13] + (k - 14) * s[13]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ptsb`. This new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, where `i` is 14. Given that `rem` is `k - i - 2`, substituting `i` with 14 gives `rem` as `k - 16`. Therefore, the new element added to `ptsb` is `preb[14] + (k - 16) * b[14]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
