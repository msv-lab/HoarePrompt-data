Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 2, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The line `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially 1, after executing this line, `leftZero` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
