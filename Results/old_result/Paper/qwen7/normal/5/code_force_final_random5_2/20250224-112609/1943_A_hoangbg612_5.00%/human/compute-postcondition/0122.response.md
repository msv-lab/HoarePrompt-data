Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `M` is a list of integers, `i` is within the bounds of `M`, and `cur` is equal to `i`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `cur - 1` (inclusive), meaning it will run as long as `i < cur`.

4. **Check the conditions for continuing the loop**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `cur`.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since `cur` is equal to `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i < cur`. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

6. **Update the state**: After incrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `cur + 1` because `cur` was equal to `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

7. **Ensure the loop continues**: To ensure the loop continues, `i` must still be less than `cur`. However, since `cur` remains unchanged, `i` must be incremented to maintain the condition `i < cur`.

Given these steps, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`M` is a list of integers, `i` is within the bounds of `M`, and `cur` is equal to `i + 1`**.
