Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing three elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, the second element is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` or `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]` depending on the value of `foundb`, the third element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, `founds` is `True` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 4, and `k` must be greater than 3. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates that the program exits the current loop or conditional block. All the variables retain their previous states, and the `break` statement is noted.
