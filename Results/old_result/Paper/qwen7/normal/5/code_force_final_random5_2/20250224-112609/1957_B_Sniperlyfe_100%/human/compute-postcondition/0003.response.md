Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be 1 because the loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - `n` must be at least 2 because the loop runs from `i = 1` to `n-1`. If `n` is 1, the loop won't run at all.

3. **Consider the state of other variables**:
   - The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition and doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `k` is used in the initialization of `nums[0]`, but its value doesn't affect the loop condition directly.
   - The list `nums` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros, and its content doesn't affect the loop condition.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be set to 1 and `n` should be at least 2.

**State after adjustment**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
