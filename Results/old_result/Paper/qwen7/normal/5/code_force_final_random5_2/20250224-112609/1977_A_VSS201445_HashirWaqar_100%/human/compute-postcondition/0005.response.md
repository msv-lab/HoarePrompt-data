Output: **NO**

Explanation: Based on the initial state, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `n` is the first integer input by the user, and `m` is the second integer input by the user. The conditions provided are that either `n < m` or `(n - m) % 2 != 0`. Regardless of these conditions, the print statement simply outputs the string 'NO'. Therefore, the output will be 'NO'.
