Output State: **`cur` is -1, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` is a list containing all such keys repeated according to their occurrences in `M`, and `T` is decreased by 1; `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The line `M = {}` initializes an empty dictionary `M`. This operation does not affect the values of `cur`, `S`, `cnt`, `T`, or `N`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
