Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The value of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
