Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The conditions for determining whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither are correctly implemented:
   - `a < b < c` checks for a stair.
   - `max(a, b, c) == b` checks for a peak when `b` is the maximum value.
   - Any other case results in "NONE".
4. The program handles all possible inputs as specified in the problem statement.
5. The provided example input and output match the expected behavior of the program.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

Correctness: **True**
