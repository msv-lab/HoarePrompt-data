Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x3` and `y3`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) remain unchanged.
