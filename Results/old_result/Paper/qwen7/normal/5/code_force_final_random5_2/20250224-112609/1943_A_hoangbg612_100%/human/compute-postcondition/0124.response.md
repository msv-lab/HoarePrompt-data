Output State: **`S` is an input integer, `M` contains keys whose values were initially set to 1 and were decremented until they became 0, `cnt` is a list containing all such keys repeated according to their occurrences in `M`, and `T` is decreased by 1; `N` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `N`. The initial state of `S`, `M`, `cnt`, and `T` remains unchanged except that `T` is decreased by 1 (though the exact value of `T` is not specified in the initial state).
