### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly initializes the index to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then processes the encoded string `b` to decode it using the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an encoded string `b` as input.
   - It first finds all unique characters in `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `unique_chars`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character.
   - Finally, it decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its mapped value from `char_map`.

4. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The logic to create the `char_map` is correct. It maps each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.
   - The decoding process using the `char_map` also appears to be correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are stored in the `results` list and printed out one by one.

Given the above analysis, the provided program seems to follow the correct steps to decode the encoded strings as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the given examples.
