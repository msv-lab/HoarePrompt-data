Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 2.
- `l` is updated to `[max(l), i]`.
- `ans` remains unchanged.
- The loop condition is based on `i` being within the range from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` with a step of 2.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop runs for values of `i` starting from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` with a step of 2.

### Loop Body:
- If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is further incremented by 2 and `l` is updated to `[max(l), i + 2]`.

### Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `i` is within the specified range and the condition `x % i == 0` is not met.

### Current Values:
- `i` is incremented by 2 at the end of the previous iteration.
- `l` is updated to `[max(l), i]`.
- `ans` remains unchanged.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be within the range and the condition `x % i == 0` must not be met.

### Adjusting the State:
- Since `i` is incremented by 2 at the end of each iteration, we need to check if `i` is still within the range and the condition `x % i == 0` is not met.
- If `x % i == 0` is not met, `i` will be incremented by 2 again, and `l` will be updated to `[max(l), i]`.

### Conclusion:
- The only variables in the loop head are `i`, so we need to adjust `i` and ensure it is within the range and does not meet the condition `x % i == 0`.

### New State:
- `i` will be incremented by 2.
- `l` will be updated to `[max(l), i]`.
- `ans` remains unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `l` is updated to `[max(l), i]`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
