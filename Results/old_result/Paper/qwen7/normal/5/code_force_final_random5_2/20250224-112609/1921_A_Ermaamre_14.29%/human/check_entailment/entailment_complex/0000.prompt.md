Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are t testcases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
            if y1 < y3:
                res = abs(y3 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y3)
        elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        
        print(res ** 2)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `a-1`, and `res` will hold the result of the last calculation performed within the loop based on the conditions provided. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, and `x4`, `y4` will be those provided by the last set of inputs processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case involves four lines of input representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. Based on specific conditions related to the coordinates, it calculates the height of the square and prints the square of this height. The function does not return any value.
