Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `num_of_lens`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `n`, while adding the new dictionary `num_of_lens` with no elements.
