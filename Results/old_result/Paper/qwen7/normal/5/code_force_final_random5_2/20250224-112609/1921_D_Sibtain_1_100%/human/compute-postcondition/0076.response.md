Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * max(t1, t2)`, `i` is either 1, 2, or 3, `j` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 3] - c[len(c) - 3])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` to be the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
