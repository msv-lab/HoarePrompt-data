Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, `i` must be `n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.**

Explanation: The code `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. Initially, `ul` was 0, so now `ul` is 2. The other variables (`res`, `re`, `ur`, `i`, `r[a[i] - 1]`, and `l[a[i] - 1]`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
