Output State: `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all values calculated during the loop based on the conditions provided, and `total_count` is the sum of all counts from the original `num_of_lens`.

In this final state, `num_of_lens` will be empty because all keys with their corresponding counts have been processed within the loop. The variable `res` will hold the cumulative result of the calculations performed inside the loop, which include terms like `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for each count `cnt` that meets the specified conditions. Finally, `total_count` will be the sum of all original counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary since it gets incremented by each count during each iteration of the loop.
