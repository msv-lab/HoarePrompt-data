Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input after `t`, `k` is the second integer input after `t`, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `healths = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `healths`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
