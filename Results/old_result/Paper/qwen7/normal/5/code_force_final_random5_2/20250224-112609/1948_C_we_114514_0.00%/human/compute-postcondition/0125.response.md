Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is equal to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `reachable_first_row`, `n`, or `j`. Therefore, the conditions for `reachable_first_row` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `reachable_second_row` is explicitly set to `True`.
