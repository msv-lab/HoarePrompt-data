Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their corresponding lengths stored in the list `nums`.
3. It then counts the occurrences of each length using `num_of_lens`.
4. The logic for calculating the number of ways to form a triangle is as follows:
   - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length (`cnt >= 3`), it adds the combinations of choosing 3 out of these sticks to the result (`math.comb(cnt, 3)`).
   - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length (`cnt >= 2`), it calculates the total number of other stick lengths (`total_sum`) and adds the combinations of choosing 2 out of these sticks multiplied by the number of ways to pair them with the remaining sticks to the result (`math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`).
5. The final result is printed after processing all test cases.

However, the logic for forming a triangle is flawed. The condition for forming a triangle is that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. The current logic does not check this condition.

Given the problem statement and the need to check the triangle inequality, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not account for the triangle inequality condition.

Correctness: **False**
