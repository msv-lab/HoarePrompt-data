Output State: **`success` is False, `position` is the position of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the `position`, `time_available` equals `distance`, `i` is `n-1`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of `bullets_needed` for all iterations, `t` is `n+1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits it into a list of integers using the `split()` method. This list is then converted to a list of integers using `map(int, ...)` and assigned to the variable `healths`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
