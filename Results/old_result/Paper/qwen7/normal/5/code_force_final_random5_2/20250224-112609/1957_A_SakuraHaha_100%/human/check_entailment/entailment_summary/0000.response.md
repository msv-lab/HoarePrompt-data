Reasoning:
- The provided program has a main loop that iterates over the test cases. However, the function `func_1()` is called without passing any arguments, which means it will use the input values from the standard input, leading to undefined behavior since the required inputs are not provided within the function.
- The logic inside `func_1()` correctly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (since each polygon needs at least 3 sides). This part of the code is logically sound.
- The program should read the number of test cases and call `func_1()` for each test case, but it currently only calls `func_1()` once and does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not properly handle multiple test cases and does not call the function `func_1()` for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
