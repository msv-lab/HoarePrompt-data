Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `k` is `k - min(nums[0] + 1, k)`; `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**

Explanation: The code updates `nums[i]` to be the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. Given that `i` is 2, `nums[i]` becomes `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged according to the provided conditions.
