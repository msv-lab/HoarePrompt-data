Functionality: **The function processes a single string `inpstr` containing only 'W' and 'B' characters. It finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string. If 'B' is not found, both indices are considered 0. The function then prints the length of the string minus the sum of these two indices.**
