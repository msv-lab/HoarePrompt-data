Output State: **`max_val` is equal to `y`, `max_val` is `x - 1` if `x % (x - 3) != 0`, otherwise `max_val` is `x - 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `y` to `max_val`. The conditions and their outcomes related to `max_val` remain unchanged because the assignment does not affect those conditions. Therefore, the output state includes both the new assignment and the original conditions.
