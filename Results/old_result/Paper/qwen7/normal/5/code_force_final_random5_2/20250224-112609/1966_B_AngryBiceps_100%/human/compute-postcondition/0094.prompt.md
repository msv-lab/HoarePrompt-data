You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and a grid of size n × m filled with 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. The sum of n·m over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input received during the corresponding iteration of the loop. The variable `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`. The variable `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in `a`. After all iterations, the conditions for printing 'NO' or 'YES' have been fully evaluated for all test cases. If any test case fails the conditions to print 'NO', it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, for all test cases that pass the conditions to print 'YES', it will print 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n × m where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The grid is filled with 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. For each test case, where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the function determines the number of white ('W') and black ('B') cells in the grid and returns the counts.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
