Let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `res` step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `a`: Must be greater than 0.
   - `i`: 0.
   - `x1`, `y1`: Input integers.
   - `x2`, `y2`: Integers from the input.
   - `x3`, `y3`: First and second integers from the input respectively.
   - `x4`, `y4`: First and second integers from the input split by space respectively.
   - `res`: 
     - If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res = |y1 - y3|`.
     - If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res = |y2 - y1|`.
     - Otherwise, `res = |y1 - y2|`.

2. **Calculation of `res`:**
   - We need to determine which condition for `res` applies based on the values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4`.
   - Since the exact values of these inputs are not specified, we need to consider all possible cases.

3. **Expression to be printed:**
   - The expression to be printed is `res ** 2`.

Given the conditions for `res`, let's analyze the possible outcomes:

- If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res = |y1 - y3|`.
- If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res = |y2 - y1|`.
- Otherwise, `res = |y1 - y2|`.

In any case, `res` is the absolute difference between two integers. Therefore, `res ** 2` will be the square of this absolute difference.

Since the exact values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `res`. However, we know that `res` will be the absolute difference between two integers, and thus `res ** 2` will be the square of that absolute difference.

Output: **res ** 2 (where res is the absolute difference between two integers)**
