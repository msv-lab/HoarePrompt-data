Reasoning:
- The program iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
- It then iterates through the array from index 0 to `n-3` (i.e., `a-2`).
- In each iteration, it checks if the current element `b[i]` is less than 0. If so, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that it's impossible to make all elements zero.
- If the current element is not less than 0, it performs the specified operations: subtracts `2*b[i]` from `b[i+1]`, subtracts `b[i]` from `b[i+2]`, and sets `b[i]` to 0.
- The loop continues until it either encounters a negative value or completes without breaking.
- After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are non-zero. If they are, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
1. The loop should start from index 1 to `n-2` instead of `0` to `n-3`.
2. The condition `b[i] < 0` should be checked before performing the operations to avoid unnecessary modifications.
3. The check at the end (`if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0`) might not be sufficient because the operations might leave some non-zero elements in positions other than the last two.

To fix these issues, the code should be adjusted as follows:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))

        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]

        else:
            if any(x != 0 for x in b):
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
```

With these corrections, the program should correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
