Output State: **`arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code converts the integer `arr[i-1]` into a list of its digits using a list comprehension and concatenates it with the list containing `arr[i]`. Since `arr[i]` was less than `arr[i-1]` before the operation, the condition remains unchanged. The new list `nums` contains all the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.
