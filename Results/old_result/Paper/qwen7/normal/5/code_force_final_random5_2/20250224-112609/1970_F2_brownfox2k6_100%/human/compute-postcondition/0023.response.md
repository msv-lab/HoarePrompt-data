Based on the initial state provided:

- `out` is a list that contains at least one element.
- `p` is the next element from the sorted `out`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
```

Here, `t` is not defined in the initial state, so it remains as `t` in the output. `p` is the next element from the sorted `out`, but since the exact value of `p` is not specified, we will leave it as `p`. The string `'ELIMINATED'` is directly printed as is.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **t, p, 'ELIMINATED'**
