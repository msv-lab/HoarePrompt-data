Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `t - 1`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `p` of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `mex`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged except for the new list `p` which is initialized as specified.
