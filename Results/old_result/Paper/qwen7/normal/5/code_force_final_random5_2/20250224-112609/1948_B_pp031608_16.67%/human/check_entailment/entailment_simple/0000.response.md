Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the operations performed inside the `for` loop do not accurately simulate the described operation of splitting elements into their digits.
2. The `func_1` function checks if the list is sorted but does not use the modified list after performing the operations.
3. The logic inside the `for` loop does not handle the splitting of elements into digits correctly. It only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10, then splits it, which is not sufficient to ensure the array can be sorted.
4. The program does not account for the possibility of multiple operations being needed to sort the array, nor does it handle cases where splitting an element might lead to a smaller element appearing before a larger one, which could prevent sorting.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
