Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The implementation is correct and efficient.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is intended to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) with the condition that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Let's break down the logic inside `func_2`:
     ```python
     def func_2(n, m):
         cnt = 0
         for i in range(1, m):
             x = n - (i * i - i)
             y = i * i
             cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
         if cnt == 0:
             return 1
         return cnt
     ```

     - The loop iterates over values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
     - For each \(b\), it computes \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
     - It then increments the count `cnt` by `x // y + (i > 1)`.
     - Finally, it returns `cnt`.

### Issues in the Function `func_2`

- **Incorrect Calculation**: The calculation of `x` and `y` does not align with the problem statement. Specifically, \(x\) and \(y\) do not represent any meaningful values related to the problem constraints.
- **Logic Mismatch**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion

The given function `func_2` is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's requirements. Therefore, the provided program is not correct.

**Correctness: **False**
