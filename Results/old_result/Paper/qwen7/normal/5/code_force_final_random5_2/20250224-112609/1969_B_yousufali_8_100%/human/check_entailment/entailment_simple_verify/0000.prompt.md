You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) and its length is at least 2.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is an input binary string, `n` is equal to the total number of '1's in `s`, `ans` is the sum of each block of '0's plus one, and `i` is the index right after the last character of `s`.
    #
    #To explain this in more detail:
    #- The variable `n` keeps track of the number of '1's encountered so far.
    #- The variable `ans` accumulates the count of each block of '0's plus one. This means if there are two consecutive '0's, it contributes 3 to `ans` (2 '0's plus 1).
    #- The variable `i` is the index of the current character being processed in the string `s`.
    #- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, indicating that all characters have been processed.
    #- `n` will be the total count of '1's in the string `s`.
    #- `ans` will be the sum of the lengths of all blocks of '0's plus one for each block.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the lengths of all blocks of '0's plus one for each block in the binary string s)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, the input is a binary string s (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2⋅10^5) representing the string that needs to be sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #In natural language: The value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases, must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute all its iterations. Since the loop runs as long as `t` is greater than 0, and no changes are made to `t` within the loop (based on the given information), `t` needs to stay greater than 0 throughout all iterations.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. 

Consider the input string `101011`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would involve multiple cyclic shifts to sort the string. However, the current implementation does not account for this. Instead, it counts the number of zeros encountered until the first '1' appears and adds that count plus one to the total cost. This approach fails to consider the need for multiple cyclic shifts to achieve the desired sorted order.

For instance, for the string `101011`, the correct minimum cost would be 9, as shown in the example output. However, the provided function `func_1` would incorrectly calculate the cost as 4, which is not the minimum possible cost.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the string as a sequence of segments of '1's and '0's and calculate the cost based on the positions of these segments.
