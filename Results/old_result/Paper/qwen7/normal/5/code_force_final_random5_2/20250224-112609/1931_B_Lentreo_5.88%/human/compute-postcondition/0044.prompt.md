Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `curr` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `last` is now the last element of the updated `nums` list, and `nums` is updated with integers from the input split into a list.
Code of the loop:
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `nums` must contain at least one element. If the index `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `nums` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element from `nums`, and `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to its current value, where `last` is the last value used for updating `curr` before the current iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nums` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element from `nums`, and `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to its current value, unless `i` is not 0, in which case the same conditions apply.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
