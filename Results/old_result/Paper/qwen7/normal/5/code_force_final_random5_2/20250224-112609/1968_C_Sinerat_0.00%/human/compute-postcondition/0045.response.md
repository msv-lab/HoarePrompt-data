Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then calculates a list `a` where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of 500 and the first `i+1` elements of `x`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case.**
