Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: reachable_first_row is True, results is an empty list, reachable_second_row is False, n is the first element of test_case, row1 is the second element of test_case which is a tuple, row2 is the third element of test_case which is a tuple.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are true, and `j` equals `n - 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: reachable_second_row remains True, reachable_first_row remains true if row1[j] == '>', otherwise it is false, and j remains unchanged if it is not decreased due to row2[j] == '>'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `reachable_second_row` remains `True`, `reachable_first_row` remains `True` if `row1[j+1] == '>'`, otherwise it is `False`, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` is not the last index (`j < n - 1`) and the element at index `j` in `row2` is '>', then `reachable_first_row` becomes `False`. If none of these conditions are met, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
