Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, `min` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, and `x` must not be equal to 1; `ans` now includes the value of `min`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Since `min` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, the list `ans` now contains the original value of `ans` (either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd) along with the value of `min`. All other variables remain unchanged.
