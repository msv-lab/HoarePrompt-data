Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since `i` is 1 or incremented such that it is still less than `n`, and there is no loop specified, the `break` statement indicates that we exit the implied loop. The value of `match_c` remains unchanged as `False`.
