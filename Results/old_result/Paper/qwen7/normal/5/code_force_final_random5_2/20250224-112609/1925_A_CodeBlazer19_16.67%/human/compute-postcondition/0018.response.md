Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 105, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `j` is 106, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `t`, `i`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. The initial values of `t` and `i` are preserved, and `n` and `k` are updated to the integers obtained from the input.
