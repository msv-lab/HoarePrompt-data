You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a_i and b_i are integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0]:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        a.sort()
        
        c.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
            continue
        
        i, j, ans = 0, 1, 0
        
        for k in range(len(a)):
            t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
            t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
            if t2 > t1:
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
            ans += max(t1, t2)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed for all its iterations, meaning `k` is equal to `0` (since the loop decrements `k` from `len(a) - 1` to `0`). The variable `ans` contains the total sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, where `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, and `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. The values of `i` and `j` are the final values they attain after processing all elements of `a` and `c` according to the conditions inside the loop. `t1` and `t2` reflect the absolute differences based on these final values of `i` and `j`.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `k` is `0`, `ans` is the total accumulated cost, and `i` and `j` are the final indices used to compute the differences.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by pairs of integers (n, m) and (a_i, b_i) for each test case. For each test case, it checks if 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5 and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. It then returns information based on the values of n, m, a_i, and b_i for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
