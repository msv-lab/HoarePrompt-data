Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer input by the user**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `w`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
