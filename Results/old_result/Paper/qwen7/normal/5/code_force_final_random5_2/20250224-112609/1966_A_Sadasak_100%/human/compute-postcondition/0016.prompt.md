Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    if frequency_table[num] > k:
        frequency_table[num] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary. If the value of `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then the value of `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in `frequency_table` regarding `num` since there is no else part provided.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers starting from the second element, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `frequency_table` is a dictionary, and if `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers starting from the third element, `num` is the third element of `arr`, and the value of `frequency_table[num]` is either greater than `k` and set to `k+1`, or it is not greater than `k` and remains as `1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
