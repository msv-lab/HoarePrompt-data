Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \) and \( k \), and an array \( a \) of length \( 2n \) where each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly twice. For each test case, it identifies and prints up to \( k \) pairs of identical elements from the array \( a \). If there are not enough pairs to form \( k \) pairs, it prints as many pairs as possible. After processing, it prints the remaining elements that were part of pairs but not fully printed due to the stopping conditions.**
