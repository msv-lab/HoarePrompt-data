Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \leq y < x\). The current implementation has a few issues:

1. **Logic for Finding Maximum Value**: The current logic checks if \(2 \cdot y \geq x\) and returns \(y\) if true. This condition does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Instead, it should check for the highest possible \(\gcd(x, y)\).

2. **Return Statement**: The function `func_1` returns `max_val` at the end of the loop, but this might not be the correct value because the loop may have exited without finding the optimal \(y\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.
    
    Args:
        x: The given integer.
        
    Returns:
        The optimal y.
    """
    max_val = 0
    for y in range(1, x):
        current_gcd = gcd(x, y)
        if current_gcd + y > max_val:
            max_val = current_gcd + y
            result_y = y
    return result_y

from math import gcd
```

In this corrected version:
- We iterate over all possible values of \(y\) from 1 to \(x-1\).
- For each \(y\), we compute \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
- We keep track of the maximum value and the corresponding \(y\).
- Finally, we return the \(y\) that gives the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
