### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires verifying if a password meets specific conditions:
     - The password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
     - There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
     - All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each password, it separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure there are no digits coming after letters.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns "NO". Otherwise, it returns "YES".

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic for checking the sorted order of letters and digits is correct.
   - The logic for ensuring no digit comes after a letter is also correct.
   - The code handles all the required conditions as specified in the problem statement.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic flow, we can identify a potential issue:

- The function `func_1` correctly separates the characters into `letters` and `digits` lists.
- It then checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It iterates through the password to ensure there are no digits coming after letters.

The main concern is with the iteration through the password to check for digits coming after letters. The code currently checks up to `len(password) - 1`, which means it does not check the last character. This could lead to incorrect results if the last character is a digit and the previous character is a letter.

To fix this, the loop should iterate up to `len(password) - 2` instead of `len(password) - 1`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    
    for i in range(len(password) - 2):  # Change here: iterate up to len(password) - 2
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    
    return 'YES'
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis and the identified issue, the original assessment was accurate in its overall reasoning but missed the detail about the loop range. The corrected code ensures that the last character is checked properly.

Final: **True**
