Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2 * n + 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`, `t` is t - 1**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the new value of `index` is the original value of `index` plus 1, while the rest of the variables retain their previous values.
