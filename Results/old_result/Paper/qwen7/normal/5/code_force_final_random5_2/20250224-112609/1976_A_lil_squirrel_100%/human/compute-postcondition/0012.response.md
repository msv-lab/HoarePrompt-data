Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the second character of `password`, `letters` is a list containing the second character of `password`.**

Explanation: The code appends the second character of `password` to the `letters` list. Since `ch` is the second character of `password`, it is added to `letters`. The other variables remain unchanged.
