Output State: **`list[i - 1]` is decreased by its own value, and the conditions for `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` remain unchanged**.

In more detail: The value of `list[i - 1]` is decreased by multiplying its current value by 1 (which means it is simply decreased by its own value). The conditions that `list[i]` is decreased by 2 times `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` is decreased by `list[i - 1]` remain unchanged because no code affects these elements.
