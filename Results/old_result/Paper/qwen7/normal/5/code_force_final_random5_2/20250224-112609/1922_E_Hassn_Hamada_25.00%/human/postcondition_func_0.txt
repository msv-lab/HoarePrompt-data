The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer, and `sequence`, a list of integers where all elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\). If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the size of the sequence needed based on `number` and fills the `sequence` list with integers from 0 to 7. Finally, it calls itself recursively with a modified `number` and processes the `sequence` list to adjust its values. The function returns either 0 or 8 depending on the input.
