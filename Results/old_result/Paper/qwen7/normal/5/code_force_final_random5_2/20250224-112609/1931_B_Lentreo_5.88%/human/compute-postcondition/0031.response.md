Output State: **`curr` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `last` is now the last element of the updated `nums` list, and `nums` is updated with integers from the input split into a list.**

Explanation: The line `curr = 0` sets the variable `curr` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `last`, or the `nums` list. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
