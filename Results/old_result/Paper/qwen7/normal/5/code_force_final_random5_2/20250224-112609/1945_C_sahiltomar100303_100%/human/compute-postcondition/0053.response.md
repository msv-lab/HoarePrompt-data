Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 1 (now `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`).**

The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` was already increased by 1 before this line of code, the new value of `rightOne` is now `rightOne + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
