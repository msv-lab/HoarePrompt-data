Output State: **`input_string` is a string input by the user, `i` is the last element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 0, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `b_d` is `dist`, `ans` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `o_l` is 0, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `z_l` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `b_d = dist` assigns the value of `dist` to `b_d`. No other variables are affected, so their previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `b_d` being set to `dist`, while all other variables retain their initial or previously calculated values.
