Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer T, an integer N, and an array of N integers. For each test case, it sorts the array, counts the occurrences of each unique integer, and determines a specific value based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the determined value for each test case.**
