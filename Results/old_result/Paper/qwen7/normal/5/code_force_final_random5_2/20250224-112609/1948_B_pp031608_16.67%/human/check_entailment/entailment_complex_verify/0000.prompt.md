You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'lst' is sorted in ascending order or not.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers (where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the list length is between 2 and 50) and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order or not.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the splitting of numbers that are at least 10 properly. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, and the logic inside the main loop is flawed.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is undefined**: The program calls `func_1` but does not define it. This would result in a runtime error.

2. **Incorrect logic for splitting numbers**: The program attempts to split numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits and insert them back into the list. However, the logic for this is incorrect. It does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits.

3. **Incorrect loop condition and logic**: The loop condition and logic inside the loop do not correctly check and modify the list to ensure it becomes sorted. The program does not properly handle the insertion of digits and the sorting process.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

However, the provided program does not produce the correct output for the first and second test cases. Here’s why:

- **First Test Case**: The input `[12, 3, 45, 67]` should become `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` after splitting, which is sorted.
- **Second Test Case**: The input `[12, 28, 5]` cannot be made sorted using the allowed operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
