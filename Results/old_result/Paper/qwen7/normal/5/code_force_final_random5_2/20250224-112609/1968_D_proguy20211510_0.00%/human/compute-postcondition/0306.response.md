The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `a`, and `maxa` retain their original values from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` is the input integer, `pb` is the input integer, `ps` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`.**
