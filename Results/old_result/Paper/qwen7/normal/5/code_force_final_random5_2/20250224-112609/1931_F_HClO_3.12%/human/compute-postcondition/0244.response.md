Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` or `idx2` is set to `n-3`; `p2` is 1; both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; the list `val` remains empty; `idx1` is less than `idx2`; the list `val` remains empty, `a2` is inserted at index `idx1`; `l` is assigned the value of `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. No other changes are made to the variables `i`, `n`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, or `a2`. The conditions and relationships between these variables remain unchanged.
