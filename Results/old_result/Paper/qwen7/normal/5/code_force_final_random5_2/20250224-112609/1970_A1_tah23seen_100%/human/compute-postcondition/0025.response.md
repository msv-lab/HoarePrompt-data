Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, and `d` is a list with the last element removed.**

Explanation: The code `d.pop(n)` removes the last element from the list `d`. Since `n` is the length of the string `s`, `d[n]` refers to the last element in the list `d`. After popping the last element, the length of `d` is reduced by one, but the values of `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
