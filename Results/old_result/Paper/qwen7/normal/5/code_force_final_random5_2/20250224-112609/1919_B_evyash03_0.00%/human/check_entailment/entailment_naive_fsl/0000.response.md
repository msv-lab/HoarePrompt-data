Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays optimally to minimize the total penalty. Instead, it splits the string `expression` based on the character '-', which is not aligned with the problem's requirement.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
+-+-+-
```
The correct optimal split would be `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`. However, the program splits the string based on '-', resulting in `(['+', '-', '+', '-', '+', '-'], [])`, which leads to a penalty of `4`.

The program should instead dynamically find the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the total penalty, but the current implementation does not achieve this.
