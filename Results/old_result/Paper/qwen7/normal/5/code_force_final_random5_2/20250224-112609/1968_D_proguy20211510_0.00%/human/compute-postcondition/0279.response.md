Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `len(pres)`. These are the variables that determine whether the loop can continue.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is within the range of `range(len(pres))` and equals `i + 1`.
   - `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`.
   - `ptsb` is updated with the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`.
   - `ptss` is unchanged, and it now contains the value `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(pres)`. Given that `i` is currently `i + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - `rem` will be recalculated as `k - (i + 2)`.
   - `ptsb` and `ptss` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

5. **Formulate the New State**: The new state should reflect these changes.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is within the range of `range(len(pres))` and equals `i + 2`, `rem` is `k - (i + 2)`, `ptsb` is updated with the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is unchanged, and it now contains the value `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`**.
