You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the last input provided before the loop completes. The variable `t` will remain unchanged from its initial value, and `i` will be equal to `t - 1`. If the sum of `a` and `b` from the last input is even, the output will be 'Bob' printed `t` times. If the sum is odd, the output will be 'Alice' printed `t` times.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final values of `a` and `b` will reflect the most recent input provided, while `t` retains its original value, and `i` is set to `t - 1`. The loop's output will consist of 'Bob' or 'Alice' repeated `t` times based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` from the last input is even or odd, respectively.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. According to the rules, the game involves taking turns and removing one coin from the current wallet, with the player who cannot make a valid move losing. However, the program incorrectly determines the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. This approach does not account for the actual game mechanics, such as the ability to swap wallets and the requirement to remove a coin before each move. For example, consider the test case `1 1`:

- Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 1 coin.
- Alice cannot swap wallets since she would end up with 0 coins, which is not allowed.
- Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet, leaving her with 0 coins.
- Bob now has 1 coin and cannot swap wallets since Alice has 0 coins.
- Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet, leaving him with 0 coins.
- Both players are now unable to make a valid move, but according to the program, Bob wins because `(1 + 1) % 2 == 0`.

This example clearly shows that the program does not correctly simulate the game, hence it is incorrect.
