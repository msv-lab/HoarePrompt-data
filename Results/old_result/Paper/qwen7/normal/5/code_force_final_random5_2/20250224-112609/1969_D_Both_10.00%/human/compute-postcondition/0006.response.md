Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `sub_summ` is `val_a[0]` + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]`
- `val_a` must be initialized
- `sec_arr` must have at least two elements

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for val_a in sec_arr:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over each element in `sec_arr`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `val_a` would have been set to the current element in `sec_arr`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine the Current Element of `val_a`:**
   - Since `val_a` was used in the previous iteration, it must have been set to the current element in `sec_arr`.
   - Let's denote the current element of `sec_arr` as `val_a_current`.

2. **Update `sub_summ`:**
   - `sub_summ` is calculated based on the first two elements of `val_a` from the previous iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `sub_summ` will be updated based on the new `val_a`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `sec_arr` has at least two elements.
   - After the previous iteration, `sec_arr` still needs to have at least two elements for the next iteration.

### Updated States
- `sub_summ` will be updated based on the new `val_a`.
- `val_a` will be set to the next element in `sec_arr`.
- `sec_arr` must still have at least two elements.

### Final Answer
State: **`sub_summ` is `val_a[0]` + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]` (where `val_a` is the next element in `sec_arr`), `val_a` must be initialized, `sec_arr` must have at least two elements**.

To be more precise:
- `sub_summ` will be updated to include the next element in `sec_arr`.
- `val_a` will be the next element in `sec_arr`.
- `sec_arr` must still have at least two elements.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`sub_summ` is `val_a[0]` + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]` (where `val_a` is the next element in `sec_arr`), `val_a` must be initialized, `sec_arr` must have at least two elements**.
