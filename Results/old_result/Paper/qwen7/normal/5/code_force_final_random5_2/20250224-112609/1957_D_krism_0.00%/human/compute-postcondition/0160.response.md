Output State: **`j` is 32, `c` remains as it was initially set, `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` reflect the count of 0s and 1s respectively up to that bit position, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` reflect the count of 0s and 1s from that bit position to the end of the integer `c`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, and `y` is equal to `arr[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the bit length of `y` and subtracts 1 to assign the result to `k`. Since `y` is equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `k` will be the number of bits in `y` minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
