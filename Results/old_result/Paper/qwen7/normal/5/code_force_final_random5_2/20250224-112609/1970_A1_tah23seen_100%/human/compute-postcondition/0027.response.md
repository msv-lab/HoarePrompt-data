Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for (i, j) in d:`. This means that the loop iterates over each tuple `(i, j)` in the list `d`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `d`**: The problem states that `d` is a sorted list of tuples from the original dictionary `d` based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order, with the last element of the tuple negated.

3. **Understand the loop execution**: For the loop to execute, there must be at least one tuple in `d` to iterate over. If `d` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `d` is a list of tuples, the loop can only execute if `d` contains at least one tuple.
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(i, j)` in `d`, so both `i` and `j` will be adjusted during each iteration, but the initial state of `i` and `j` before the loop starts is not relevant to the loop condition itself.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `d` to ensure that the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`d` is a sorted list of tuples from the original dictionary `d` based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order, with the last element of the tuple negated, and must contain at least one tuple**
