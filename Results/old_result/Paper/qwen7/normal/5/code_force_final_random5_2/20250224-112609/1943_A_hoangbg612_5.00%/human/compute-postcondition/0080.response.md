Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` updates the value of `cur` to be the same as the value of `num`. The other variables (`_`, `S`, `N`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition mentioned (if the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then the condition is met and we break out) is not directly relevant to the output state since the code only updates `cur` and does not check any conditions.
