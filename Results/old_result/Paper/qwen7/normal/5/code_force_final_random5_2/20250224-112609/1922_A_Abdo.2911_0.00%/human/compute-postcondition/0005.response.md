Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input value, `b` is the stripped input value, `c` is the stripped input value from the current line of input**.

Explanation: The code `c = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to `c`. The initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
