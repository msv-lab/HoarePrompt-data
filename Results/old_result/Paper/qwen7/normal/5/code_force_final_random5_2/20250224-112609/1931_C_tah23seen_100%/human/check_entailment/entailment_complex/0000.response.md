Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`). This part is correct.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - The first while loop increments `i` as long as the current element is equal to the next element. This ensures that `i` points to the end of the longest prefix of equal elements.
   - The second while loop decrements `j` as long as the current element is equal to the previous element. This ensures that `j` points to the start of the longest suffix of equal elements.
   - After these loops, the function checks if the first and last elements of the array are equal. If they are, it calculates the cost as `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.
   - The logic for calculating the cost is correct because:
     - If the first and last elements are equal, the optimal strategy is to change all elements except the last one to match the first element.
     - If the first and last elements are not equal, the optimal strategy is to either change all elements except the prefix or the suffix to match the first or last element, whichever is cheaper.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when the array is already uniform or when the first and last elements are different but the rest of the array is uniform.

Given the above analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **True**
