State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine how many times it should iterate.
2. The variable `_` is used as a placeholder for the loop variable, indicating that the specific value of the loop variable is not needed within the loop body.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a non-negative integer, but since the problem specifies that the loop should execute, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. The initial state of `t` being an integer input by the user does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can run.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.
