Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 0, `l` is an integer from input, `r` is an integer from input, `sumInRange` is the sum of integers from index `l-1` to `r`, `onesInRange` is the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]` if `l` is not equal to `r`, `l` and `r` are assigned the values from input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `l` and `r`. The initial conditions and variables `q`, `sumInRange`, and `onesInRange` remain unchanged.
