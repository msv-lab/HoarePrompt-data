Output State: **`a3` is an integer from the input split into a list, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input split, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `l11` is 0, `l22` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is -1, `val` is an empty list, and we continue the loop or iteration.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts them to integers, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition `idx1 <= idx2` and the continuation of the loop or iteration are preserved.
