You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 1000 sets of three integers (a, b, and c) where each integer is between 0 and 9. For each set, it prints 'STAIR' if a < b < c, 'PEAK' if a < b > c, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all sets, it does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c`. This is correct because it ensures that the digits form a staircase pattern.
   - **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c`. This is also correct because it ensures that the digits form a peak pattern.
   - **Neither Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NONE". This is correct as well.
4. **Output**: The program outputs the correct string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case based on the conditions.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all possible inputs as specified, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
