Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and `nums` now contains an additional element which is `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Since `nums` originally contained integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and `nums[23]` was `k - 2^{23}`, after appending `k + 1`, the list `nums` now includes this new value. All other variables remain unchanged.
