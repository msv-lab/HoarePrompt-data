Output State: **`coord` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (x, y) from the input, and the second tuple is also (x, y); `i` is 1; `x` is updated to the first integer from the input split; `y` is updated to the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The `coord` list remains unchanged, and `i` retains its original value of 1.
