Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer (though `n` is not used in the print statement).
- `s` is an input string (though `s` is not used in the print statement).
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.

The conditions given are:
- The number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is less than or equal to 2.
- The number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is odd.
- Now `cnt1` is greater than 2.

Given these conditions, the only logical conclusion is that there is a contradiction because `cnt1` cannot simultaneously be greater than 2 and also be less than or equal to 2. However, since the print statement does not depend on `cnt1` or any other variable, it will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
