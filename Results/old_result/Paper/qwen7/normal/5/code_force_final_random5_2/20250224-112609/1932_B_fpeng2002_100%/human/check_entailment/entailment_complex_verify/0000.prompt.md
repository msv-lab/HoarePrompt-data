You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: `start_year` will be equal to the final value obtained by successively applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the `nums` list, with `x` taking the value of the last index of `nums` after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `start_year` by successively applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the list `nums`. After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of `start_year` for the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. According to the problem description, the tribe waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the previous one. However, the current implementation calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities, which does not necessarily give the correct result.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```
The correct sequence of years would be:
- First sign in year 3
- Second sign in year 4 (after the first)
- Third sign in year 8 (after the second)
- Fourth sign in year 10 (after the third)
- Fifth sign in year 18 (after the fourth)
- Sixth sign in year 36 (after the fifth)

However, the program calculates the LCM of 3, 2, 4, 5, 9, and 18, which is 180. This is incorrect because it does not follow the sequential waiting period as described in the problem.

To fix this, the program needs to iteratively calculate the next year for each sign based on the previous one, rather than finding the LCM of all periodicities at once.
