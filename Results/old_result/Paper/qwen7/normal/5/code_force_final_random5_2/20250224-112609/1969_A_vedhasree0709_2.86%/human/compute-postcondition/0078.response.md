Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers, and the current value of `l[i]` is 2, the current value of `l[i + 1]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `j`, `l`, and the conditions related to `l[i]` and `l[i + 1]` remain unchanged. We also continue to break out of the most internal loop or if statement as specified in the precondition.
