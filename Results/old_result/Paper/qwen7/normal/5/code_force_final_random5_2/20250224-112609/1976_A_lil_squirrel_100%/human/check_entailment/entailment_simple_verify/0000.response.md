### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to ensure it meets all the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement.

1. **Only lowercase Latin letters and digits**:
   - The program correctly separates the characters into `letters` and `digits` lists based on whether they are alphabetic or numeric. This ensures that only these types of characters are considered.

2. **Digits in non-decreasing order**:
   - The program sorts the `digits` list and compares it with the original `digits` list. If they do not match, it returns "NO". This correctly checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.

3. **Letters in non-decreasing order**:
   - The program sorts the `letters` list and compares it with the original `letters` list. If they do not match, it returns "NO". This correctly checks if the letters are in non-decreasing order.

4. **No digit after a letter**:
   - The program iterates through the password and checks if a letter is followed by a digit. If such a sequence is found, it returns "NO". This correctly ensures that no digit appears after a letter.

From the annotated code, we can see that the program follows the steps outlined above accurately. The program processes each character in the password, separates them into `letters` and `digits`, sorts them, and then checks the conditions as described.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program meets all the necessary conditions for a strong password. The annotated code also supports this conclusion by clearly explaining each step and state transition.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
