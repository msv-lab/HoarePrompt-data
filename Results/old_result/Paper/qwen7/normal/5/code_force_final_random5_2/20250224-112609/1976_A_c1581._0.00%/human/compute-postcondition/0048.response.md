Postcondition: **The loop will have executed for as many times as there are characters in the password. After all iterations, `last_digit_index` will either be the index of the last digit in the password (if any digits exist), or -1 if no digits are found. The value of `i` will be equal to the length of the password. The function will return 'NO' if a non-digit character is encountered after `last_digit_index` has been set to a positive value. The list `digits` is not sorted.**
