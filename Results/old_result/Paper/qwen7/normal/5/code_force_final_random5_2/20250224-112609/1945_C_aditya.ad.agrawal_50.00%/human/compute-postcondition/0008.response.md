Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`.**

The code assigns the current value of `o` to `o_r`. Since `o` represents the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `o_r` will also represent the same count. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
