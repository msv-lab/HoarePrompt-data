Output State: **`kq` is the sum of the differences calculated in all previous iterations, `itest` is `previous_itest + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. The values of `kq`, `itest`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The newly created list `a` contains the integers entered by the user.
