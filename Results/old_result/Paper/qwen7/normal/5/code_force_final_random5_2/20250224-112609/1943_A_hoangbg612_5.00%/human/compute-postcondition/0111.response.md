Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function argument `cur`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of each iteration.
   - The loop will iterate from `0` to `cur-1`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `cur` must be greater than 0. If `cur` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `cur` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`_`, `S`, `N`, `M`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cur` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`cur` must be greater than 0**
