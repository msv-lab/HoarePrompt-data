You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        
        print(dx * dx)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a 4x4 matrix of integers entered by the user for each iteration, `x` is a list of the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a` for each iteration, and `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x` for each iteration. The final output will be the result of `dx * dx` printed for each of the `t` iterations, concatenated together if `t` is greater than 1.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will consist of `t` lines, each line displaying the result of `dx * dx` for that particular iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It checks if the given four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, form a valid square. If the conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
