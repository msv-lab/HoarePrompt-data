Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `p1`, and `p2`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
