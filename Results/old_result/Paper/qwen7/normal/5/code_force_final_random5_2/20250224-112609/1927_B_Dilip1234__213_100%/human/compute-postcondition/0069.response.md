Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. Each element `a_i` in `a` represents the number of previous indices with the same character in the string. The function constructs a string `s` based on these conditions and returns it. After execution, the function returns the string 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy'.**
