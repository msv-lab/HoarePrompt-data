Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: For each iteration, `num` takes the next value from the list `N`. The loop modifies the variable `cur` and the dictionary `M` based on the value of `num`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is the next integer from the list `N`.
   - `cur` is an integer.
   - `M[cur]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is taken from the list `N`, the next value of `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.
   - The variable `cur` will be updated based on the condition in the loop body.
   - The dictionary `M` will be updated accordingly.

Given the conditions:
- If `num > cur`, then `cur` is incremented by 1 and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

Since we don't know the exact value of `num` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.
- `cur` will be updated based on the condition (either incremented by 1 or remain the same).
- `M[cur]` will be updated based on the condition (either set to 1 or incremented by 1).

However, since we need to provide a specific state, we can assume that `num` is the next element in the list `N` and `cur` and `M[cur]` will be updated according to the condition.

**State:**
- `num` is the next integer from the list `N`.
- `cur` is an integer that may be incremented by 1 or remain the same.
- `M[cur]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`.

To provide a concrete example:
- If `num` was 5 and `cur` was 3, then `cur` would be incremented to 4 and `M[4]` would be set to 1.
- If `num` was 3 and `cur` was 3, then `M[3]` would be incremented by 1.

For simplicity, let's assume the next `num` is 6 and `cur` is 4 (as an example):

**State:**
State: **`num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is 4, `M[4]` is either 1 or 2 depending on the previous value**.

If `M[4]` was 1 before, it will be set to 1 again. If it was 0, it will be set to 1. If it was 1, it will be incremented to 2.

So, the final state is:
State: **`num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is 4, `M[4]` is 1 or 2**.
