The code assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`. Since `pos` is initially 1, `ans` will be 1. The conditions and the values of `i`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `b_d`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is the first element of the list `arr`; `pos` is 1; `z_r` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 1; `o_r` is decreased by 1; the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true; the condition `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` is true; the condition `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is true; `ans` is 1.**
