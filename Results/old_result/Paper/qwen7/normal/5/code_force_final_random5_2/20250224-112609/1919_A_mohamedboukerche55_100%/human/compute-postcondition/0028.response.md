Output State: The value of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the last input provided before the loop completes. The variable `t` will remain unchanged from its initial value, and `i` will be equal to `t - 1`. If the sum of `a` and `b` from the last input is even, the output will be 'Bob' printed `t` times. If the sum is odd, the output will be 'Alice' printed `t` times.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final values of `a` and `b` will reflect the most recent input provided, while `t` retains its original value, and `i` is set to `t - 1`. The loop's output will consist of 'Bob' or 'Alice' repeated `t` times based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` from the last input is even or odd, respectively.
