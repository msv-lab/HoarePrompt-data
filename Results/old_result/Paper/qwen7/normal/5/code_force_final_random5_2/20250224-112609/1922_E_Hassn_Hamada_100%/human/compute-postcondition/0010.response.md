Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.

2. **Understand the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `size`: This is defined as `i + 1`.
   - `i`: This must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `number`: This must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` simplifies to `2 * (1 << size) - (1 << i)`.
   - Given `size = i + 1`, the expression becomes `2 * (1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`.
   - Simplifying further, this is equivalent to `2 * (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i) = 2 * (2 * (1 << i)) - (1 << i) = 4 * (1 << i) - (1 << i) = 3 * (1 << i)`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `3 * (1 << i) <= number` must hold true.
   - Since `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `number` must be greater than or equal to 1, the key factor here is `i` and `number`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The loop can continue as long as `3 * (1 << i) <= number`.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to ensure that the current value of `i` and `number` satisfy this condition.
   - Since `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and `number` must be greater than or equal to 1, the critical part is ensuring that `3 * (1 << i) <= number`.

Given these considerations, we need to ensure that `i` and `number` are set such that the loop condition holds true for the next iteration.

**Final State**:
State: **`size_overlap` is (1, 0), `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << i)`**
