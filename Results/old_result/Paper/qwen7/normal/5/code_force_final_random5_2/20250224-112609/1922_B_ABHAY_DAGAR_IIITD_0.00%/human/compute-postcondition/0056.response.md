Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, `n` is an input integer, `test_cases` is decremented by 1**.

This means that the variable `n` has been assigned the value of the integer input, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The decrement of `test_cases` by 1 is implied but not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so it is included in the output state.
