Output State: **`i` is less than `t`, `l` is 'NO', `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `i`, `t`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n` (where `n` was previously undefined) remain unchanged except for `n`, which now holds the value of the integer input.
