Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `num` is the next element in the list `N`, and `M[cur]` is updated to 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` updates the dictionary `M` such that the key `cur` now maps to the value `1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
