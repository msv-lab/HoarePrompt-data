Output State: **`max_val` is `x - 2`, `x` is greater than 1, and `y` is `x - 2`.**

Explanation: The code sets `max_val` to the value of `y`. Given the initial conditions, `y` is equal to `x - 2`. Therefore, after executing the line `max_val = y`, `max_val` becomes `x - 2`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. Since the condition `2 * y >= x` was used to determine the return value, and now `max_val` is set to `y`, no further changes are made to `max_val`, `x`, and `y`.
