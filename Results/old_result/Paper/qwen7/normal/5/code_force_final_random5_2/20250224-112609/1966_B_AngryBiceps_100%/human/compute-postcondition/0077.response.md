Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the original input, the second element is the original input, and the third element is the new input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the last element of the original input and the first element of the new input, `last_row` is increased by the last element of the new input, `last_row` is further increased by the last element of the last sublist of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increases `last_row` by the last element of the last sublist of `a`. Since `a` is a list containing three sublists, the last sublist is `a[2]`, and the last element of `a[2]` is `a[2][-1]`. Therefore, `last_row` is increased by `a[2][-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
