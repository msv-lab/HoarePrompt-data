Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to \( k \) bridges.
- The program correctly handles the condition when \( k \geq n - 1 \). In this case, destroying \( n - 1 \) bridges would isolate island 1 from all other islands, so the output is 1.
- When \( k < n - 1 \), the program prints \( n \), which is the correct output because even with \( k \) bridges destroyed, Everule can still potentially visit all islands through alternative routes.

Given the logic in the program matches the problem requirements and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
