The function processes a game state at a specific time step `t`. It identifies players whose positions match any of the Bludger positions and marks them as eliminated by setting their positions to `[-1, -1]`. It then prints a message for each eliminated player indicating the time step and player identifier. After processing, it ensures that all players who matched Bludger positions have been eliminated and prints the final state. The function does not return any value.
