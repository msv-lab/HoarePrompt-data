Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `f` is the second integer input minus 2, so `f = n - 2`.
- `k` is the third integer input minus 2, so `k = n - 2`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` without any dependence on the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
