Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `t` is 200001.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since it starts from `t` and decreases in each iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is 200000.

Since there are no other variables involved in the loop head, we only need to adjust `t`.

**State: **`t` is 200000**
