Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in num_list:`. The objects involved here are `x`, `num_list`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.
   - `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `num_list`. For the loop to execute, `num_list` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is the variable used in the loop, it will take on the value of each element in `num_list` during each iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, `x` can be considered as the first element of `num_list`.
   - `num_list` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `num_list` must contain at least one element, and `x` is the first element of `num_list`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element of `num_list`**
