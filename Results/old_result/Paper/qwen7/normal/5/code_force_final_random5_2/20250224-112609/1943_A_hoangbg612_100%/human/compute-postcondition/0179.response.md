Output State: **`cur` is set to the second element in the list `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = cnt[1]` simply assigns the value of the second element in the list `cnt` to the variable `cur`. No other variables are affected. The precondition that the length of the list `cnt` is at least 2 ensures that `cnt[1]` is a valid index. Therefore, the output state reflects this assignment.
