Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers.
   - The condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds.
   - In the if part, `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`.
   - In the else part, either `a` is greater than or equal to `b` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains the same (an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive).
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same as they are not affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers**.
