Output State: `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split value, `y` is an input integer from the third split value, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((1, `y`), (`x`, `y`), (2, `y`), (3, `y`)).

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations (4 times), the variable `i` will be 3 since the loop runs in a range from 0 to 3 inclusive. For each iteration, it takes two integers as input, appends them as a tuple to the list `coord`, and increments `i`. Therefore, after 4 iterations, `coord` will contain 4 tuples corresponding to the inputs provided in each iteration.
