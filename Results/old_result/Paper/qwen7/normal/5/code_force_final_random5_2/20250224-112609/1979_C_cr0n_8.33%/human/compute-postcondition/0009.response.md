Output State: **`prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the original `vals` list, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is an empty list since all elements have been processed, and `r` is not applicable as the loop has completed.**

In this final state, the variable `prod` will hold the cumulative product of all integers originally in the `vals` list because the loop multiplies `prod` by each element in `vals` exactly once. The variable `t` and `N` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The `vals` list becomes empty as all its elements have been processed. The variable `r` is no longer used after the loop completes.
