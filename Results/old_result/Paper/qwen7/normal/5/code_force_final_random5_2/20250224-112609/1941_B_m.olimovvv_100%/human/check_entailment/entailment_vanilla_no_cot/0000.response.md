Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The key issues are:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**: The program attempts to reduce the array elements using a different set of operations than specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the program subtracts `b[i]` from `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]`, which does not match the required operations of reducing `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The program checks if any element is negative after the first operation and immediately prints 'NO'. However, the problem allows for multiple operations, and checking just the first operation is insufficient.

3. **Final Check**: The final check only verifies the last two elements, but it should verify that all elements are zero.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Calculate the prefix sums
        prefix_sum = [0] * n
        prefix_sum[0] = arr[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + arr[i]

        # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 3
        if prefix_sum[-1] % 3 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue

        # Check if we can make all elements zero
        for i in range(n - 2):
            if arr[i] > prefix_sum[i + 1]:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            if arr[-2] > prefix_sum[-1] - arr[-2]:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It calculates the prefix sums of the array.
2. It checks if the total sum of the array is divisible by 3.
3. It then checks if it's possible to make all elements zero by ensuring no element is greater than the sum of the remaining elements up to that point.

This approach ensures that the operations defined in the problem statement are correctly applied and the conditions for making all elements zero are checked accurately.
