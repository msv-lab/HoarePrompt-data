Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`.**

This means that `k` is assigned the value of `x` divided by `n` using integer division. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
