Output State: **`curr` is `i - last`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string that must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of the list `nums`, `i` is the first element of `nums`, and the current value of `i` is not 0.**

Explanation: The value of `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to its current value, which was 0. Therefore, `curr` now holds the value of `i - last`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
