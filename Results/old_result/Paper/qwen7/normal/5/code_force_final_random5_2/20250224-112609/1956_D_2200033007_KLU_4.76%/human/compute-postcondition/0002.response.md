Output: **4 1**

Explanation: The initial state defines that the list `c` is equal to 2. This means `c` is a list with a single element, which is 2. The variables `m` is 0, and there are no other relevant variables or conditions affecting the print statement. Therefore, the print statement simply outputs the fixed string "4 1".
