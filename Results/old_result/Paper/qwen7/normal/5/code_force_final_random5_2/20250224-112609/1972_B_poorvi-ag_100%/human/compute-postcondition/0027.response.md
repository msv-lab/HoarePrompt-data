Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no'.
- The first element of `results` is assigned to `i`.

When the code snippet `print(i)` is executed, it will print the value of `i`, which is the first element of the `results` list.

Since the exact value of the first element of `results` is not specified, we denote it as the first element of the list.

Output: **'yes' or 'no' (where 'yes' or 'no' is the value of the first element in the `results` list)**
