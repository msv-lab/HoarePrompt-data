Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this, we should arrange the elements such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty using the sorted array.
   - Sorting ensures that the smallest element is paired with the largest possible next element, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
   - It iterates through the sorted array and computes the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach is correct because sorting allows us to maximize the beauty as explained.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases and outputs the results.
   - The logic inside `func_2` is also correct as it properly uses `func_1` for each test case.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: Input: `3 2 1 3`
  - Sorted array: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Beauty: \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\)

- **Example 2**: Input: `3 69 69 69`
  - Sorted array: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0\)

- **Example 3**: Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
  - Sorted array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Beauty: \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\)

- **Example 4**: Input: `4 3 4 3 3`
  - Sorted array: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Beauty: \((3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)

- **Example 5**: Input: `2 2 1`
  - Sorted array: `[1, 2]`
  - Beauty: \((2 - 1) = 1\)

All these examples are handled correctly by the provided functions.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis and verification, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: **True**
