Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(4)`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 4. Since `i` is currently 4, the loop will not execute again because `4 < 4` is false.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop will not execute again, there is no need to change the value of `i`. However, we should note that the loop will not run again.

Given this analysis, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop will not execute again.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 4; `x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer from input; `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`**
