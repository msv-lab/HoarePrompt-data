Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer in the initial state. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) are assigned the values from the input, which are also positive integers according to the precondition.
