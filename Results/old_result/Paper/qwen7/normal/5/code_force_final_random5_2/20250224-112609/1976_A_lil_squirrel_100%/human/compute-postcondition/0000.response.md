Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits; `letters` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `letters`. The values of `n` and `password` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 20, and `password` is still a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The new information is that `letters` is now an empty list.
