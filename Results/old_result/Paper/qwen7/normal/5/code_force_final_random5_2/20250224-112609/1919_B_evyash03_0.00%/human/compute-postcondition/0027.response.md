Output State: **`count` is either 2 or 3, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+", "-", `balance` is increased or decreased by 1 depending on the last character of `expression`.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if it was initially 2, it becomes 3. The `expression` and `balance` remain unchanged from their initial postconditions, with `balance` adjusted by the last character of `expression` (either +1 or -1).
