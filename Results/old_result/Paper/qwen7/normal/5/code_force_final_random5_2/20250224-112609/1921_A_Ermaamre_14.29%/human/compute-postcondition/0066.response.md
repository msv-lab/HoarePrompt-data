Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are assigned as per the input.
- `res` is calculated as follows:
  - If `x1` is not equal to `x4` or `x3` is not equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.
  - If `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.
  - If `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.

The expression `res ** 2` will be evaluated, which means `res` will be squared.

Given the conditions for `res`, the value of `res` depends on the inputs `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4`. Since the specific values of these inputs are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `res`. However, we can describe the value of `res` based on the conditions given.

Output: **res ** 2 (where res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2 if x1 is not equal to x4 or x3 is not equal to x2, otherwise it is the absolute difference between y1 and y3 if x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, and otherwise it is the absolute difference between y1 and y2 if x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4)**
