Postcondition: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list, and `thorn` is either 2, 1, or 0. If `i` equals '@', `thorn` becomes 0. If `i` equals '*', `thorn` becomes either 2 or 1 depending on its original value (0 or 1). If `i` does not equal '*' or '@', `thorn` is set to 0.
