Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`. The objects involved here are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `cnt`: This variable will take on the values from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `num_of_lens`: This is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each integer in `num_list`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair. This means `num_of_lens` must not be an empty dictionary.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, it needs to have at least one entry for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`total_count`, `res`, `num_list`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `n`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total_count` is 0, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, `res` is 0, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially**.
