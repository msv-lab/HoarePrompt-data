Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is a list of integers where the second element is 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is the original fourth element minus the second element, the fifth element is the original fifth element minus twice the first element, and this process continues until the end of the list. If the last two elements are both 0, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will still be an integer greater than 3, and `b` will be a list of integers where:
- The second element (`b[1]`) will be 0.
- The third element (`b[2]`) will be 0.
- Each subsequent element in the list will be modified according to the operations performed within the loop: each element `b[i+1]` is reduced by `2 * b[i]`, and `b[i+2]` is reduced by `b[i]`. This continues until the end of the list.

If the final two elements of the list (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are both 0, the output will be 'YES'. Otherwise, the output will be 'NO'.
