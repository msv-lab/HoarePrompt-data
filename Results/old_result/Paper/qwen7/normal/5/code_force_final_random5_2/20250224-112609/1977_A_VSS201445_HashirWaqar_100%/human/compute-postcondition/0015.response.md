Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `m` is the integer input by the user in the previous iteration.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` are not relevant to this specific print statement since it does not use any of these variables.

Output: **YES**
