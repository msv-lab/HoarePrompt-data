Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is `x` // 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000**

Explanation: The value of `x` is halved using the floor division operator `//`, which means `x` is divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest whole number. The other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Since the initial value of `x` was even, the new value of `x` will also be an integer.
