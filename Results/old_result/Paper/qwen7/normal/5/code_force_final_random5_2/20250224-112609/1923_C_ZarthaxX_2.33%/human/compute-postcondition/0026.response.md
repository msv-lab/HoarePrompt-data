Based on the initial state provided:

- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from input.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of integers from index `l-1` to `r`.
- `onesInRange` is the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]` if `l` is not equal to `r`. Otherwise, it is 0.
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange` holds true.

The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs a string without any variables or conditions dependent on the values of other variables, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **NO**
