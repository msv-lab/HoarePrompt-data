Output State: **`n` is `t-1`, `s` is the sum of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each test case, and we have processed `t-1` test cases.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l`, calculates `s` using the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`, prints `s`, and then decrements `n`. After processing all test cases, `n` will be `t-1`. The value of `s` accumulates the results of the calculation for each test case.
