You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` will be an empty string, `one` will be equal to the total number of '1's in the original string `s`, and `cost` will be equal to the sum of `(number of '1's + 1)` for every occurrence where a '0' is followed by at least one '1'.
    return cost
    #The program returns 0



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order through cyclic shifts. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to minimize the total cost.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
101011
```
The expected output is `9`, but the program outputs `5`.

To see why, let's analyze the optimal solution for this case:
1. Choose the substring `[3, 5]` (i.e., "101"): `101011 -> 011011`. Cost: 3.
2. Choose the substring `[1, 2]` (i.e., "01"): `011011 -> 110110`. Cost: 2.
3. Choose the substring `[2, 3]` (i.e., "11"): `110110 -> 110011`. Cost: 2.
4. Choose the substring `[4, 5]` (i.e., "11"): `110011 -> 111001`. Cost: 2.
5. Choose the substring `[6, 6]` (i.e., "1"): `111001 -> 111100`. Cost: 1.

Total cost: 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 10.

However, the program calculates the cost based on the number of '0's followed by the first '1', which does not always yield the minimum cost. For instance, in the example "101011", the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 5 instead of 10.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
