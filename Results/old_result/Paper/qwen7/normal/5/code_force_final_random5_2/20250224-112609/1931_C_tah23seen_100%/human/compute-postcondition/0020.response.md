Output State: **`i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` are equal.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will eventually reach 0 because the loop decrements `j` until it finds a pair of elements that are not equal or until `j` becomes 0. At this point, the loop terminates. Since `i` is incremented as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` and `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`, `i` will be set to the length of the array once the loop exits. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `len(arr)` and `j` will be 0. Additionally, all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` must remain equal for the loop to continue functioning as described.
