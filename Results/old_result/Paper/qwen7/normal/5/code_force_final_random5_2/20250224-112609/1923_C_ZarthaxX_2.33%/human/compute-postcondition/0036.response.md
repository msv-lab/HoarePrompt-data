Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` must be greater than or equal to 0, `l` and `r` are assigned the values from input split by space, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `sumInRange` as the sum of elements in the range `[l, r]` from the `sum` array, which is computed as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. This value replaces the existing `onesInRange` calculation, but since the problem specifies to include all the information of the precondition that is still valid, `onesInRange` remains as initially defined, and `q`, `l`, and `r` retain their input values.
