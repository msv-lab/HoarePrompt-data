Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- Either `a` is not equal to `b` or `b` is not equal to `c`.
- `max(a, b, c)` is not equal to `b`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NONE')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NONE**
