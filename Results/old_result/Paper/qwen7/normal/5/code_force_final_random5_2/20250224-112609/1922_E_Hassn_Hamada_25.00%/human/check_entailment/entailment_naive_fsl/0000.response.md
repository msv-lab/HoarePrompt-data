Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences \(X\). Specifically, the function `func_1` seems to be intended to generate the required sequence, but it does not handle all cases correctly.

One issue is that the function `func_1` is not correctly generating sequences for all values of \(X\). For example, consider the case where \(X = 2\):

- The expected output should be an array of length 1 with a single element 0, because the only increasing subsequence is the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just the single element 0.
- However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly and prints a sequence of length 1 with a single element 0, which is correct for \(X = 2\), but the structure of the code suggests it might fail for other values of \(X\).

Another issue is the complexity and correctness of the recursive approach used in `func_1`. The logic within the function is complex and may not cover all edge cases, especially for larger values of \(X\).

To verify, let's consider another example:

- For \(X = 5\), the expected output could be an array of length 3 with elements [0, 1, 0], as it has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: [], [0], [1], [0, 1], and [0].
- However, the current implementation might not produce this exact sequence or any valid sequence for \(X = 5\).

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
