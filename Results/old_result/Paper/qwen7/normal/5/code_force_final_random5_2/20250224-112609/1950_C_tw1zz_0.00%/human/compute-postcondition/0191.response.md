Based on the initial state provided:

- `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', or a time between '05' and '23'.
- `m1` is equal to the string `m`.
- `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
- `h` is a time value ranging from '00' to '23'.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `h1` is a valid hour value as described.
2. `m` is a string representing minutes.
3. `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
4. The `sep=''` parameter in the `print` function means that no separator will be used between the arguments, so the values will be concatenated directly.

Given these conditions, the output will be the concatenation of `h1`, `:`, `m`, a space, and `time`.

Output: **h1:m time**
