Postcondition: `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`, `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `t` is `t - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and the first element of `nums` (`i`) is not 0. Since the if condition checks if `i != 0`, and the if part updates `curr` to `curr + (i - last)`, and there is no else part, the overall postcondition remains the same as the if part.
