Based on the initial state provided, `res` must contain at least one element. However, no specific value or type of `res` is given, and the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, it is likely a placeholder or an undefined variable in this context.

Given the lack of specific information about `i`, we can only say that `i` is being printed without any additional context or value. Therefore, the output will simply be the value of `i`.

Output: **i**
