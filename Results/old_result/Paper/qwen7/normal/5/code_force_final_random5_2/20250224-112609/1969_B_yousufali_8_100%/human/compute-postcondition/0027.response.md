Output State: `s` is an input binary string, `n` is equal to the total number of '1's in `s`, `ans` is the sum of each block of '0's (each block's value is the length of the block plus one) in `s`, and `i` is the index of the last character in `s`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will hold the count of '1's in the binary string `s`. The variable `ans` will contain the sum of each block of '0's found in `s`, where each block's value is calculated as the length of the block plus one. The variable `i` will be set to the index of the last character processed in the string `s`.
