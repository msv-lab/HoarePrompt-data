Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic. The key issue lies in the condition used to determine the winner. The logic should be based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins in Alice's wallet after each player's turn, not the sum of the coins in both wallets.

Here's the correct approach:

1. If `a` (Alice's coins) is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position because she can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, which means Bob will eventually be forced to leave Alice with an odd number of coins.
2. If `a` is even, then after Alice's first move, the number of coins in her wallet becomes odd. From there, Bob can mirror Alice's moves to ensure he always leaves Alice with an even number of coins, forcing Alice to eventually lose.

Based on this logic, the correct implementation would be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This code correctly checks the parity of Alice's initial number of coins (`a`) and determines the winner based on that.
