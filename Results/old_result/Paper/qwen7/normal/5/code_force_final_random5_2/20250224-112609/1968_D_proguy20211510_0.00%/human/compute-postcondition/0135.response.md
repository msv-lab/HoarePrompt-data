Output State: **`i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `ptsb` contains the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` contains the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`**.

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `pres` minus one, since the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches the end of the list.
- The variable `rem` will be `k - len(pres) - 1`, as `rem` is calculated as `k - (i + 1)` and `i` ends at `len(pres) - 1`.
- The list `ptsb` will contain the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`.
- The list `ptss` will contain the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`.
