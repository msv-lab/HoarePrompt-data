### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Each move either adds 1 cube or removes 1 cube.
   - The net change in the number of cubes after `n` moves is `n - m`.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - The total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because we can't have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes, i.e., `(n - m)`, must be even. This is because every addition and removal of a cube is a pair of moves, and thus the difference must be even.

3. **Checking the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m)` is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Verification:**
   - For the first test case (`3 3`):
     - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
     - `n - m = 0` (even), and `n >= m` (true)
     - Output: "YES"
   - For the second test case (`2 4`):
     - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
     - `n - m = -2` (even), but `n < m` (false)
     - Output: "NO"
   - For the third test case (`5 3`):
     - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
     - `n - m = 2` (even), and `n >= m` (true)
     - Output: "YES"

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
