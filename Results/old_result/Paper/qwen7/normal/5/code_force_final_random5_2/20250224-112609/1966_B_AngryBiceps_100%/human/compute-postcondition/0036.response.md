Output State: **`last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is an empty string**.

The code `a.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
