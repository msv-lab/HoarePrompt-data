Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `max_val` is `x - 1`
   - `x` is greater than 1
   - `y` is `x - 2`
   - If `x % y == 0`, then `max_val` remains `x - 2`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged at `x - 1`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):`
   - This means `y` starts from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `y`:**
   - Since `y` is currently `x - 2`, the next value of `y` will be `y - 1`, which is `(x - 2) - 1 = x - 3`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `y > 1`.
   - Since `y` is now `x - 3`, we need to ensure `x - 3 > 1` or equivalently `x > 4`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `max_val` remains unchanged if `x % (x - 3) != 0`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains `x - 2`.
   - `x` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `y` is now `x - 3`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `max_val` remains unchanged based on the condition.
- `x` remains the same.
- `y` is now `x - 3`.

Therefore, the new state is:

**State: **`max_val` is `x - 1` if `x % (x - 3) != 0`, otherwise `max_val` is `x - 2`, `x` is greater than 1, and `y` is `x - 3`**.
