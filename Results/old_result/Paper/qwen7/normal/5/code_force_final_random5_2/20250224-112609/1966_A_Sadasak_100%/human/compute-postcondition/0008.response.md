Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers starting from the second element, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `frequency_table` is a dictionary, and `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the `frequency_table` dictionary now has its count for the value of `num` (which is the second element of `arr`) incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
