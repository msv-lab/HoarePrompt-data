Output State: **`i` is 0; `idx1` is 0; `n` is greater than 1; the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`; and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`; `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`; `p1` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to `p1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
