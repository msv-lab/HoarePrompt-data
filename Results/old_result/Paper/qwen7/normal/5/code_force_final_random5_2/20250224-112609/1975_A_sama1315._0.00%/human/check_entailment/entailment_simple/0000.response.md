Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If there is at least one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element, it returns 'No' unless the entire array can be made sorted by splitting and swapping.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` does not account for the possibility of sorting the array through the specified operation (splitting and swapping). It only checks if the array is already sorted or not.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input reading and processing, and prints the results in the required format.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping, but `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted.
   - The logic in `func_1` does not handle the scenario where the array can be sorted by the specified operation. Therefore, `func_1` alone is insufficient to solve the problem as stated.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem statement. The function `func_1` does not check if the array can be sorted by the specified operation.

Correctness: **False**
