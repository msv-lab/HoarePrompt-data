Output State: `left` will be 0; `rightZero` will be the total number of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`; `rightOne` will be the total number of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`; `leftZero` will be 0; `leftOne` will be 0; `leftMove` will be 0; `left` will be 0; `right` will be `n - 1`; `trightZero` will remain unchanged; `trightOne` will remain unchanged; `t` will remain unchanged; `n` will remain unchanged.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `left` will be 0 because the condition `left > 0` will no longer be satisfied once `left` reaches 0. `rightZero` will be the total number of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`, as it increments each time a '0' is encountered moving from right to left. Similarly, `rightOne` will be the total number of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`. Both `leftZero` and `leftOne` will be 0 because they are reset to 0 when `left` reaches 0. `leftMove` will also be 0 since `left` does not move beyond 0. The indices `right`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `t`, and `n` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
