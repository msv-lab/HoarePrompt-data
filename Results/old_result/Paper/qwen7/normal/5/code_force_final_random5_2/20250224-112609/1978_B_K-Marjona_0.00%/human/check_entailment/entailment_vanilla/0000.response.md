Let's reason through the solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - Bob can choose an integer `k` (where \(0 \le k \le \min(n, b)\)) to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price.
   - The modified price for the `i-th` bun (for \(1 \le i \le k\)) is \(b - i + 1\) coins.
   - The remaining \(n - k\) buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - We need to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If \(b \le a\), the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, so selling all buns at the usual price `a` gives the maximum profit.
   - If \(b > a\), we need to consider the optimal value of `k` to maximize the profit.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the profit, we should minimize the total cost of the first `k` buns while maximizing the number of buns sold at the higher usual price `a`.
   - The optimal `k` is determined by comparing the sum of the modified prices with the usual price `a`.

4. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns is given by the arithmetic series formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) = \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - The total profit is then:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \left(\frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2}\right) + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]

5. **Implementation Check:**
   - The code calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`, which ensures that `k` is within the valid range.
   - If `b <= a`, it directly prints `a * n` as the profit.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula derived above.

### Code Verification:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            # Calculate the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns
            modified_price_sum = (k * (2 * b - k + 1)) // 2
            # Calculate the remaining buns sold at the usual price
            usual_price_profit = (n - k) * a
            # Total profit
            total_profit = modified_price_sum + usual_price_profit
            print(total_profit)
```

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit. It handles both cases where \(b \le a\) and \(b > a\) appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
