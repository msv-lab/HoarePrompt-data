Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, and list `s` contains either `a[ps - 1]` if `founds` is True, or the element from `a` that matches the conditions specified in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with three elements where the first is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, the second is the original element, and the third is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `b` includes `a[pb - 1]` as the third element. If `founds` is True, `s` contains `maxa`. Otherwise, if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` contains `a[ps - 1]` and `s` has appended `a[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, `s` is now `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. The loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, `i` is 4, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with five elements where the first is 0, the second is the original element, the third is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]`, the fourth is 0, and the fifth is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]`. Additionally, `s` is a list containing either one or two elements where the first is 0, and if `s` contains two elements, the second is either `a[ps - 1]` or `maxa`, and `ps` is equal to `p[ps - 1]` if the condition `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is met; otherwise, `s` is a list containing two zeros.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
