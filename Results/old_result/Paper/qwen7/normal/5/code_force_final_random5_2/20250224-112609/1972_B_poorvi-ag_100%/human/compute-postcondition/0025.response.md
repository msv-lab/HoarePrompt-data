Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 99, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input from the user for the last iteration, `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, which is 99 since `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). For each iteration of the loop, the program reads a new value of `n` and a string `arr` from the user, checks if the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd, and appends 'yes' or 'no' to the `results` list accordingly. Thus, after 100 iterations, the `results` list will contain 100 elements, each indicating whether the count of 'U' in the respective `arr` was odd or even.
