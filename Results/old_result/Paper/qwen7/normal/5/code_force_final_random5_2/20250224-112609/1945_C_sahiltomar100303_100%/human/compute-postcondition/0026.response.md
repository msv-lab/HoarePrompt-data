Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` must be greater than 1, `leftOne` is 3, if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2**

Explanation: The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially 2, after executing this line, `leftOne` becomes 3. The other variables (`i`, `mid`, `leftZero`, and `s[1]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
