Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` will be the input integer, `a` will be a list containing `n` elements, each being the corresponding input from the user, `first_row` will be the concatenation of the first characters of all elements in the list `a`, and `last_row` will be the concatenation of the last characters of all elements in the list `a`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1` (since it increments with each iteration), the list `a` will contain exactly `n` strings, each representing the input provided by the user during the respective iteration. The string `first_row` will consist of the first character from each of these `n` strings concatenated together, and `last_row` will consist of the last character from each of these `n` strings concatenated together.
