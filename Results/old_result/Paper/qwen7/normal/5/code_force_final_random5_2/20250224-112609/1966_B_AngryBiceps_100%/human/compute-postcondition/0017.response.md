Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` remains a valid integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input received during the loop's iterations. `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each string in the list `a`. `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each string in the list `a`, repeated according to their appearance in the list.

In more detail:
- `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is determined before the loop starts.
- `a` will contain exactly `n` elements, with each element being the input provided on each iteration of the loop.
- `first_row` will be constructed by concatenating the first character of each string in `a`.
- `last_row` will be constructed by concatenating the last character of each string in `a`, with each character appearing as many times as it does in `a`.
