Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`, and `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] + 2`**

Explanation: The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` increments the value of `d[i + 1]` by 1. Given the initial state where `d[i + 1]` is either `d[i] + 1` or `d[i] - 1`, after executing the code, `d[i + 1]` will now be `d[i] + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
