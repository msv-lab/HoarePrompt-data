Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is equal to 4, `next_year` is equal to 4, `a[1]` remains unchanged.

In this scenario, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The variable `last_year` will be updated to the final value calculated, which is `4` based on the given iterations. The variable `next_year` will also be `4` as it is updated to the same value as `last_year` in the last iteration. The value of `a[1]` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
