Output State: **`i` is 14, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - i - 2`, `ptsb` has an element equal to `preb[12] + (k - 13) * b[12] + preb[13] + (k - 13) * b[13]`, `ptss` is a list with two elements, where the first element is `pres[12] + (k - 14) * s[12]` and the second element is `pres[13] + (k - 14) * s[13]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rem` to `k - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 14 - 1` or `k - i - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
