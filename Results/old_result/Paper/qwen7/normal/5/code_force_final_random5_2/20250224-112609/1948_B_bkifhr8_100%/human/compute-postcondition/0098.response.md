Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is set to `False`, and `i` is now `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be the first element of the list `nums`. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the precondition.
