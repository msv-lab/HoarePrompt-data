Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `t`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `data` is unchanged.
   - `index` is `index + 3 * n + 1`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`.
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index - n - 1]`.
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `arr` is updated to be a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to update `t` for the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1 - 1 = t - 2`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 3 * n + 1`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index - n - 1]`, `t` is `t - 2`, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`**.
