Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    k = x // n
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            l = [ans]
            if i <= k:
                l.append(i)
            if x // i <= k:
                l.append(x // i)
            ans = max(l)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value found among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, `i` is the last odd number checked before `x` (or `x` itself if it is odd), `x \% 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether `x` is even, the loop has run through all odd numbers from the smallest possible (1 if `x` is even, otherwise 1) up to `x` (if `x` is odd) or `x - 1` (if `x` is even), and `l` is not explicitly mentioned as it is replaced by the variable `ans` which holds the maximum value found during the loop's execution.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `ans` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, considering only the odd divisors of `x`. The variable `i` will be the last odd number that was checked, and `x % 2 == 0` will indicate whether `x` was initially even or odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `x` will be reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` will remain as 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is reduced to its smallest prime factor if possible, otherwise `x` is 1; `n` is defined and non-zero; `ans` is the maximum value found during the loop iterations; `i` is the last even or odd number checked before the loop terminates; `l` is a list containing all the factors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
