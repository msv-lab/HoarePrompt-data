Output State: **`success` is True, `position` is the position of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the `position`, `time_available` equals `distance`, `i` is `n-1`, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `t` is `n+1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions.**

Explanation: The code simply sets the variable `success` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
