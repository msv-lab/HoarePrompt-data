Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and `k` is now `k - (min(nums[0] + 1, k))`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `n` remains at least 2. The value of `k` is decreased by `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, which is the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`.
