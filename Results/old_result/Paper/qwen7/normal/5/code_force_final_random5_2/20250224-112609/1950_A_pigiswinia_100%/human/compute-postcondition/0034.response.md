Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `i=0` to `i=t-1`), and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user for the last iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still hold the initial value it was given (an integer between 1 and 1000). The variable `i` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from `i=0` to `i=t-1`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will contain the values entered by the user for the last iteration of the loop, regardless of whether the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` were met or not.
