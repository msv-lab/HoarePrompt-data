Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is 31; `pre[i][0]` is 32.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all 32 iterations, the variable `i` will be 31 (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration), and each list in `pre` will have its first element set to 32, as `pre[i][0]` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    cur = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if cur >> j & 1:
            suf[j][1] += 1
        else:
            suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 31, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 31, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31, if `cur >> j & 1` was true for any iteration, `suf[j][1]` is the count of such occurrences, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is the count.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations (from `j=0` to `j=31`), the variable `j` will be 31. The `suf` matrix will contain counts for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, indicating how many times the corresponding bit in `cur` was 1 or 0 across all iterations of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 30, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `j` is 32, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31:
- If the bit at position `j` in `cur` (which is `prefix[30]`) is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is the count of occurrences where `prefix[30] >> j & 1` was true.
- If the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is the count of occurrences where `prefix[30] >> j & 1` was false.

This means that after all 32 iterations of the loop, the variable `j` will have reached 32 (beyond the loop's range), and the matrix `suf` will contain the counts of how many times each bit in `prefix[30]` was found to be 1 or 0. Specifically, `suf[j][1]` will hold the count of bits set to 1 at position `j`, and `suf[j][0]` will hold the count of bits set to 0 at position `j` for every `j` from 0 to 31.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is an integer which is 29, `j` is 32, and `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31: if the bit at position `j` in `cur` (which is 29) is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is 32; if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is 32.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
