Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and a grid of size n × m filled with 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. The sum of n·m over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
        ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input received during the corresponding iteration of the loop. The variable `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`. The variable `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in `a`, and each character appears twice in `last_row`. Additionally, the length of the set of the first character of the first element in `a` is 1, the length of the set of the last character of the last element in `a` is 1, and the first and last elements in `a` are not the same, or the first character of the first string in `a` is not the same as the last character of the last string in `a`, and at least one of the first or last strings in `a` contains more than one unique character. The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is either not equal to 1 or the length of the set of characters in `last_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the corresponding input from the user, `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of all elements in the list `a`, and `last_row` is the concatenation of the last characters of all elements in the list `a`. The first element of `a` and the last element of `a` either do not consist of a single unique character or they are the same. If the first element of `a` consists of the same character and the last element of `a` consists of the same character, and the first and last elements of `a` are different, then the condition holds. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`, and `last_row` is the sum of the last elements of all sublists in `a`. The first sublist in `a` and the last sublist in `a` are either entirely the same or both contain more than one unique element, and the sets of the first sublist and the last sublist each contain exactly one unique element, with these two unique elements being different.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
