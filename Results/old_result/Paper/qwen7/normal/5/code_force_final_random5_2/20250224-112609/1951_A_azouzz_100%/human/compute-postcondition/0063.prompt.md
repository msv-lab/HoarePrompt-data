Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, start and end are integers such that start <= end, and both start and end are used to filter folder names which should be digits within the specified range.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2:
        print('NO')
    elif cnt1 == 1:
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. If the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` (denoted as `cnt1`) is greater than 2 and even, then `cnt1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or odd, it is set to 0. If `cnt1` is 1, it remains 1. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, it is set to 0 if '11' does not exist in `s` or if the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, `t` is decreased by 1 again. Otherwise, if the string `s` contains '11', `t` is decreased by 1 once more. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the new string `s`. If the number of '1's (`cnt1`) in the string `s` is greater than 2 and even, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the else part, meaning `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the new string `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
