Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, reachable_first_row remains true if row1[j] == '>', otherwise it is false.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This does not affect the value of `reachable_first_row`, which remains unchanged based on its initial condition (true if `row1[j] == '>'`, otherwise false). The value of `j` also remains unchanged as no operation modifies it.
