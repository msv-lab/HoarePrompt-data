Reasoning:
The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by generating an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The core logic involves determining the appropriate length of the array and filling it with specific values to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to determine the length of the sequence (`size`) needed to have a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The function then fills the sequence with integers from 0 to 7 and adjusts the values to ensure the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.

2. **Recursive Call and Adjustment**:
   - The function makes a recursive call with a modified `number` and processes the sequence to adjust its values.
   - The adjustment step ensures that the sequence has the exact number of increasing subsequences by adding values to specific positions in the sequence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `number` is 0 by returning 0.
   - For other values, it calculates the necessary size and fills the sequence appropriately.
   - The recursive call and adjustments ensure that the sequence meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The main loop reads the test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The recursive approach and sequence adjustments ensure that the output meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
