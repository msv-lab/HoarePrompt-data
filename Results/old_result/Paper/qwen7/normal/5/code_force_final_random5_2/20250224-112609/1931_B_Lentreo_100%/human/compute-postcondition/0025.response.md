Output State: `total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is the sum of all elements in `nums` adjusted by subtracting `mean` for each element, `i` is `n`, and if `curr` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without returning 'NO', `curr` will be the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and `mean`.
