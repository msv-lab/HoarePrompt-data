Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - 1`, and `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid) // 2**.

Explanation: The code `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. Since `trightZero` was either equal to `trightZero - 1` or remained the same, after executing the code, it is now equal to `trightZero - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
