Postcondition: `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `nums` is sorted, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.
