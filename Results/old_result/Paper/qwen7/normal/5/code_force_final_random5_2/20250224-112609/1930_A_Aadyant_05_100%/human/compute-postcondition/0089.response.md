Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer \( n \) and \( 2n \) integers. It calculates the sum of every second element from each group of \( 2n \) integers, starting from the first element, and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum in the list.**
