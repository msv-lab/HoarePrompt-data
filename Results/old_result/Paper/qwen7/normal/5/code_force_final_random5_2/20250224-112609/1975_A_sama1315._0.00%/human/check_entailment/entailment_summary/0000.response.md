Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
2. The provided code consists of two functions:
   - `func_1`: This function checks if the array is already non-decreasing. If it is, it returns 'No', otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. However, this function does not solve the problem as stated; it only checks if the array is already sorted.
   - `func_2`: This function reads input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`. It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.
3. The core logic needed to solve the problem is missing. Specifically, the function should check if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. The current implementation of `func_1` does not perform this check.
4. To correctly solve the problem, we need to implement a function that checks if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. This involves finding a point in the array where the subarray after this point, when moved to the beginning, results in a non-decreasing array.

Given the current implementation, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement because it does not implement the necessary logic to determine if the array can be rearranged as specified.

Correctness: **False**
