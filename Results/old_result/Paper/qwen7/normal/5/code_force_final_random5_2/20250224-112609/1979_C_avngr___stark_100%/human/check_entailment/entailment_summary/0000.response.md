Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the provided code:

### Problem Requirements:
1. For each test case, we need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
2. The multipliers \( k_i \) for each outcome are provided.
3. If no such distribution exists, we should output `-1`.

### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a list of integers (multipliers \( k_i \)) and applies the `func_1` function to them.
   - `func_1` computes the absolute value of the product of two numbers divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - `func_2` computes the GCD of all the multipliers using `func_1`.
3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the GCD of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then divides this GCD by each multiplier to get the bet amounts.
   - If the sum of these bet amounts is not less than the GCD, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

### Verification:
- The GCD calculation ensures that the bet amounts are the largest possible values that satisfy the condition.
- Dividing the GCD by each multiplier gives us the minimum bet amounts that ensure the total bet is less than the reward for any winning outcome.
- The logic correctly handles the condition that the total bet must be strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome.

Given the provided code and the problem requirements, the code appears to correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**
