Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e` and prints it. However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should consider splitting the array into segments where the sum of elements in each segment is zero or close to zero, as this would minimize the penalty. The current implementation simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and prints their difference, which is not a valid solution according to the problem's requirements.
