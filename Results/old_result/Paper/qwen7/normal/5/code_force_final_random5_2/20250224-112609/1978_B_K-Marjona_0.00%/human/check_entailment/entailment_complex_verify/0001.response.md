### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling \( n \) buns.
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price which decreases linearly from \( b \) to \( b - k + 1 \).
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It calculates \( k \) as the minimum of \( n \) and \( b - a \). This ensures \( k \) is non-negative and does not exceed the number of buns or the difference between the initial and usual prices.
   - If \( b \leq a \), it means the usual price is higher or equal to the modified price, so no promotion is beneficial, and all buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula:
     - The sum of an arithmetic series for the first \( k \) buns: \(\frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1))\).
     - The remaining buns sold at the usual price \( a \): \((n - k) \times a\).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating \( k \) is correct.
   - The condition `if b <= a` correctly identifies when no promotion is beneficial.
   - The arithmetic series sum formula is applied correctly to calculate the profit for the first \( k \) buns.
   - The remaining buns are correctly calculated and added to the total profit.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \( b \leq a \), the solution correctly prints \( n \times a \).
   - When \( b > a \), the solution correctly uses the arithmetic series sum formula and the usual price for the remaining buns.

However, there is a potential issue with the calculation of the sum of the arithmetic series. Specifically, the formula used is:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1)) \]

This formula is correct, but let's verify it step-by-step:

- The sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is \( b \) and the last term is \( b - k + 1 \) is indeed:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1)) \]
- Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ b + (b - k + 1) = 2b - k + 1 \]
- Thus, the formula becomes:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (2b - k + 1) \]

The provided code correctly implements this formula:
\[ \text{Sum} = (b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 \times k \]

This is equivalent to:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (2b - k + 1) \]

Therefore, the formula is correct and the implementation is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the profit based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
