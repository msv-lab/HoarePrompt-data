Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")".
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `d[2]` is either 2 or `d[1] - 1` depending on whether the second character of `s` is "(" or ")".

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(s)`. Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(s)`.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - `s` remains unchanged within the loop.
   - `n` (the length of `s`) remains unchanged.
   - `d[2]` is determined based on the second character of `s` and does not change unless the second character changes, but since it is given as a postcondition, we assume it remains consistent.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`, so if `i` was 1, it will become 2.
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `d[2]` remains the same as per the given postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 2, and `d[2]` is either 2 or `d[1] - 1` depending on whether the second character of `s` is "(". If the second character is "(", `d[2]` is 2. If the second character is ")", `d[2]` is `d[1] - 1`.**
