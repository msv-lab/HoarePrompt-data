Output State: **reachable_first_row is false, reachable_second_row is True, the element at index j in row1 is not equal to '>', and the current value of row2[j] is '>' and j is less than n - 1.**

Explanation: The variable `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`, while all other conditions remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `reachable_second_row` and retains the original conditions for `reachable_first_row`, `row1[j]`, and `row2[j]`.
