Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty binary string, and `cost` is increased by the number of '1's in the string `s`. Specifically, if the first character `i` of `s` is '1', then `one` is set to 2. If the first character `i` of `s` is '0', then `cost` is increased by the number of '1's in the string `s` plus 1.
