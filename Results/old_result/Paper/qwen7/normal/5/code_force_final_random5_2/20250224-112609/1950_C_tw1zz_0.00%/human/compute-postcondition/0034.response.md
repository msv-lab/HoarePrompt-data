Output State: **`h1` is '06', `m1` is equal to the string `m`, `time` is 'AM'**

The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `h1` and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `h1` is still `'06'` and `m1` is still equal to the string `m`. The variable `time` is now set to `'AM'`.
