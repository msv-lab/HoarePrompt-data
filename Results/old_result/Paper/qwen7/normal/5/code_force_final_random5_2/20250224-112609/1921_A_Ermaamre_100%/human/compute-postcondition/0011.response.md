Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(t)` construct. This means the loop variable is `_` (which is typically an underscore when the loop variable is not used), and the loop will iterate `t` times.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a 4x4 matrix of integers.
   - `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`.
   - `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` must be greater than 1 at the start, after one iteration, `t` will be decremented by 1, making it greater than 0 but not necessarily greater than 1 anymore.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` will be decremented by 1, so if `t` was 2 before the iteration, it will be 1 after the iteration.
   - `a` remains unchanged since the loop body does not modify `a`.
   - `x` remains unchanged since the loop body does not modify `x`.
   - `dx` remains unchanged since the loop body does not modify `dx`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (since it was greater than 1 before and was decremented by 1).
- `a` remains a 4x4 matrix of integers.
- `x` remains a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`.
- `dx` remains the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a 4x4 matrix of integers, `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`, `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`**.
