Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` converted to a string and then to integers, `ans` is set to `False`, and `i` is now `i + 1`**.

Explanation:
- The code converts `arr[i - 1]` to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and appends it to the list `nums`. It then appends `arr[i]` to `nums`.
- `arr[i - 1]` is already a number, and its digits are added to `nums` as individual integers.
- `arr[i]` is appended to `nums` as an integer.
- The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged.
