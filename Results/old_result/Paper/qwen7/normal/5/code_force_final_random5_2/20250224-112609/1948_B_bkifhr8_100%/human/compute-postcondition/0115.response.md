Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each starting with an integer n indicating the number of subsequent integers to process. The function then processes these n integers and returns a result based on the given conditions, though the specific result is not detailed in the provided information.
