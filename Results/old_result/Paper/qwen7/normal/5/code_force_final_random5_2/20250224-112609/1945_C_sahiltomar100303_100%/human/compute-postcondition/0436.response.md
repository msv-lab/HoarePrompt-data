Output State: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is either 1, 2, or 3, `leftOne` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `right` is `right + 1`, `trightZero` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `trightOne` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. Since `leftZero` was either 0, 1, or 2, after incrementing, it could now be 1, 2, or 3. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions involving these variables must still hold true.
