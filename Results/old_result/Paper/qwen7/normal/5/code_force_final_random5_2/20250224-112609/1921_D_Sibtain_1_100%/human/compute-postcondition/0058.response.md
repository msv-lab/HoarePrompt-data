Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `t1` the value of the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`. Given that `i` was initially 0, `t1` is now `abs(a[0] - c[0])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
