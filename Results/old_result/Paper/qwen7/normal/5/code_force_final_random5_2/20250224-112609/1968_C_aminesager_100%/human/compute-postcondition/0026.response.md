Output State: **`i` is `n-2`; `a` is updated such that its last element is now the sum of the second last element of `a` and the element at index `i-1` of `T`.**

Explanation: The code appends to list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. Given that initially `i` is `n-1`, `i - 1` becomes `n-2`. Therefore, `a` gets updated by appending the sum of the element at index `n-2` of `a` and the element at index `n-2` of `T`. After this operation, `i` is decremented by 1, making it `n-2`.
