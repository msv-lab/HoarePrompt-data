Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, `cur` is the current maximum value encountered so far, `M[cur]` is the count of occurrences of `cur` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the current maximum value (`cur`) in the dictionary `M`. Therefore, the value of `M[cur]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
