Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `qi` is 2.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `ans` is calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`.
- `a` is then updated to an input integer.
- `b` is then updated to an input integer.
- `m` is then updated to an input integer.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which was initially calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`. Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated after the calculation of `ans`, these updated values will be used in the calculation if needed, but the value of `ans` itself remains the same as it was computed before the updates.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `ans` as it was computed initially, which is `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2**
