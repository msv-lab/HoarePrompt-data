Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- `x` will be reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` will remain as 1.

When the print statement `print(ans)` is executed, it will print the value of `ans`.

To explain further:
- `ans` is determined during the loop where the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` is found.
- After the loop, `x` is either reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 (if such a factor exists), or it remains as 1 if no such factor exists.

Therefore, the output will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to k)**
