Output State: **`start_year` is 0, `x` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`, `num_tests` is equal to `num_tests - 1`, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `start_year` to 0, overriding its previous value which was determined by the expression `(start_year // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)`. The values of `x`, `num_tests`, and `n` remain unchanged.
