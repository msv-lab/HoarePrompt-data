Reasoning:

The given program aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program correctly processes multiple test cases, reads the coordinates of the corners for each test case, and calculates the area of the square.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Coordinates**: For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners and stores them in a list `coord`.
3. **Sorting Coordinates**: The coordinates are sorted, which helps in identifying the correct pairs of adjacent corners.
4. **Calculating Side Length**: The program calculates the squared distance between two adjacent corners to determine the side length of the square. This is done using the formula \( \text{side}^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 \).
5. **Determining Area**: The area of the square is calculated by taking the square root of the squared distances and multiplying them together.
6. **Output**: The area is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for the given input format and guarantees. There are no logical errors or issues in the implementation that would cause incorrect results.

Correctness: **True**
