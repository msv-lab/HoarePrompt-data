Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `a` is an input string
   - `b` is an input string from the user
   - `c` is an input string
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, the next value of `i` will be `1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same and must still be greater than 0.

5. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - The postcondition `if a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES' does not change based on the loop iteration itself but rather on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` at each index `i`.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
- `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is 1 (increased by 1)
- `n` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from the user, `c` is an input string, `n` must be greater than 0**
