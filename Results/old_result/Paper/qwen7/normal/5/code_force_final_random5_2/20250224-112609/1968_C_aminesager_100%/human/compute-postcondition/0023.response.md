Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially `n-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute as long as `1 <= i < n`. 

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the range `1` to `n-1` (inclusive of `1` but exclusive of `n`). Given that `i` is currently `n-1`, it cannot satisfy the condition `1 <= i < n` unless `n` is greater than `1`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than `1` for the loop to start executing.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`a`, `result`, `t`, `line`, and `T`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1**
