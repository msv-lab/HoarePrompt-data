Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string based on the values of a, b, and c within specific ranges (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9) for each test case where t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicates the number of test cases.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters but processes a series of test cases, each defined by the integers a, b, and c, and returns a string for each test case based on the conditions provided.
