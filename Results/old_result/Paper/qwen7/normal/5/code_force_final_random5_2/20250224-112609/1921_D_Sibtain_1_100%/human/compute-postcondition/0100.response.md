Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for k in range(len(a))`. This means the loop variable `k` will take values from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `k`**: From the given state, `k` is currently 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `len(a)`. Since `k` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `len(a)` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means `k` should be initialized to 0 (which it already is), and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` and `len(a)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is 0, `len(a)` must be greater than 0**
