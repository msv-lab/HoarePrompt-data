Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either a lowercase letter where neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` matches it, or it is not a lowercase letter where either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches it when converted to lowercase. If the condition `a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
