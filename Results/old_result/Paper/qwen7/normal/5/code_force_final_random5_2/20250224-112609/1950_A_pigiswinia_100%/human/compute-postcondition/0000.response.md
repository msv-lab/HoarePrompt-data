Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property but now holds the specific integer value input by the user. All other conditions and constraints on `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged and are still valid.
