The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers a. It then updates a list p such that each element p[i] is calculated as mex - a[i], where mex is the minimum value found in the updated list p. After processing all test cases, the function prints the updated list p for each test case.
