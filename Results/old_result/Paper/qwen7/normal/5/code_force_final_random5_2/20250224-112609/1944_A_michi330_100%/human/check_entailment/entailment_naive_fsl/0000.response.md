Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n-1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `k` is less than `n-1`, Everule can still visit more than one island. However, the current implementation always prints `n` when `k < n-1`, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the test case `4 1`. Here, `n = 4` and `k = 1`. The optimal strategy for Dominater would be to destroy a bridge that connects island 1 to another island, say island 2. This way, Everule can still visit islands 1, 3, and 4, making the minimum number of islands Everule can visit 3. However, the program incorrectly outputs `4`.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the minimum number of islands that can be visited by considering the optimal bridge destruction strategy. Specifically, if `k < n-1`, Everule can visit `n - ceil(sqrt(2*k + 0.25)) + 1` islands.
