Output State: **`a` is a 2D list representing the field, where each element is a string of length 2; `x` is the first element of the list `a`; `y` is the second element of the list `a`; `dx` is the first element of the list `b`; `dy` is the second element of the list `b`.**

In this scenario, the code `dx, dy = b` unpacks the list `b` into two variables `dx` and `dy`. The values of `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
