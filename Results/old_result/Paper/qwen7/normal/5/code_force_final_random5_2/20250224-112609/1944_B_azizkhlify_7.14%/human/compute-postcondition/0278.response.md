Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is at least 1, `ul` is increased by 2, `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.**

Explanation: The variable `ul` is incremented by 2, making it `ul + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `i < n` and `n` being at least 1 are still valid. The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` remains 2.
