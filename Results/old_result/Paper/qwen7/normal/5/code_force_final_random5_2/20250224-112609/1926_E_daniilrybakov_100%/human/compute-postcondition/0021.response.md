Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4, `n` is now `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + `x`, `m` is 4, `x` is (n + 1) // 2, and `s` is increased by `x`.**

Explanation: The variable `m` was multiplied by 2, changing its value from 2 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
