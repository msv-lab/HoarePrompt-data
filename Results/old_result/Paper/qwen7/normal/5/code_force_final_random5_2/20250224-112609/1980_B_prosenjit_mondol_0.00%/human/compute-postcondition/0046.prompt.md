Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for all i in range n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`, list `a` is sorted in descending order, and if `a[k]` is greater than `x`, `a[k]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `a[k]` is greater than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is now `k - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `a` is sorted in descending order, `f` is decreased by 1, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `f` is the second integer input minus 2, `k` is the third integer input minus 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`, and the list `a` is sorted in descending order. If `a[k] > x`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
