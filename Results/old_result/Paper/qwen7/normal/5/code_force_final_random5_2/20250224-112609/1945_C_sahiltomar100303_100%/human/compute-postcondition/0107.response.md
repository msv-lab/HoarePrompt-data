Output State: **`right` is less than `n - 1`, `tleftZero` is increased by 1, and `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` must still hold**.

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `right`, and `n` must still hold true after the increment. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `tleftZero` and the unchanged conditions.
