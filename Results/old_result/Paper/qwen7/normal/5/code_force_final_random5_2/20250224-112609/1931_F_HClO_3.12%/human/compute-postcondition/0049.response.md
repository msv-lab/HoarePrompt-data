Postcondition: **`idx1` is either `n - 2` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1` or `i`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `l11` is 0, `l22` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either equal to `n - 2` or `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)` (if the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is true) or `i` remains unchanged (if the condition is false), and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative integers.**
