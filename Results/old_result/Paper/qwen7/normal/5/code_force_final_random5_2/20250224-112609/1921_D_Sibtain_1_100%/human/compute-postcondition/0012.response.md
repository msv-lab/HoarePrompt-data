Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\).
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space.
   - `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The length of list `a` is 1, so `a` contains one integer.
   - `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is initially sorted in non-decreasing order and then sorted in non-increasing order.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
   ```

Given that `a` contains only one integer, let's denote this integer as `x`. Therefore, `a = [x]`.

- `max(c)` gives the largest element in the list `c`.
- `min(c)` gives the smallest element in the list `c`.

The expression inside the `print` function calculates the maximum of two values:
1. The absolute difference between `x` and the maximum element in `c`.
2. The absolute difference between `x` and the minimum element in `c`.

Since `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order and then in non-increasing order, the maximum element in `c` is the last element, and the minimum element in `c` is the first element.

Thus, the print statement will output:
\[ \text{max}(|x - \text{last element of } c|, |x - \text{first element of } c|) \]

Output: **max(|x - last element of c|, |x - first element of c|)**
