Output State: `number` must be at least 255, `i` is 8, `size` is 8, `sequence` contains the elements `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

Explanation: After 6 iterations, the loop terminates because `(1 << 8 + 1) - 1 = 255` is no longer less than or equal to `number`, which is 255. Therefore, `size` remains 8, `i` becomes 8, and the `sequence` list contains all integers from 0 to 7.
