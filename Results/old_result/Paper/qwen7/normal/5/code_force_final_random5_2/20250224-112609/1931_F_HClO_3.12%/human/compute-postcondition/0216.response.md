Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` is equal to `i` or `idx2` is equal to `i`, and `p2` is 1, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged, and the condition that the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1` also remains valid.
