You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with the following characteristics:
    #
    #- `i` is 0, as the loop decremented `i` from `m - 1` to 0.
    #- `m` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
    #- `arr` is updated such that for every pair of consecutive elements where the second element is less than the first, the first element has been updated to match the smallest value in the sequence formed by concatenating and sorting the digits of the two elements.
    #- `ans` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the loop's condition was met throughout all iterations. If `ans` is `True`, it means that for every pair of consecutive elements where the second element is less than the first, the first element has been successfully updated to match the smallest value in the sequence formed by concatenating and sorting the digits of the two elements. If `ans` is `False`, it means that at some point during the loop's execution, the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` was found to be true, and `ans` was set to `False`, breaking the loop.
    #
    #The final state of `arr` and `ans` will reflect the outcome of the loop's execution based on the input provided.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
