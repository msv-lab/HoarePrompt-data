Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `res` must contain elements, `ul` is equal to `ur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables `i`, `res`, `ul`, and `ur`. The condition `if r[a[i] - 1] == 2` is not evaluated because the `break` statement is executed immediately. Therefore, the value of `ul` remains unchanged as per the original postcondition.
