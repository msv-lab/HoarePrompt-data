Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with an additional element `k - 2^{23}` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 23, `nums[idx]` is \(2^{23}\). Therefore, the new element appended to `nums` is `k - 2^{23}`. All other variables remain unchanged.
