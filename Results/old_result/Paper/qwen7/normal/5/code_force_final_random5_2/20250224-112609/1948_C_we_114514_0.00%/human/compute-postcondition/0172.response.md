Postcondition: **reachable_first_row and reachable_second_row are both True, n must be greater than 0, and j is n. If `row1[j] == '>'`, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, reachable_first_row is False, reachable_second_row is True, and if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>',` the condition holds true.**
