Postcondition: `num_of_lens` must not be empty, and `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (where `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`) if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or `res` and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged if `cnt` is less than 2.
