You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer, and `sequence`, a list of integers where all elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\). If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the size of the sequence needed based on `number` and fills the `sequence` list with integers from 0 to 7. Finally, it calls itself recursively with a modified `number` and processes the `sequence` list to adjust its values. The function returns either 0 or 8 depending on the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`).
   - The array length should be at most 200.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence based on the input number.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.
   - The key logic in `func_1` involves binary representation and manipulation to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Binary Representation Insight:**
   - The function uses binary representation to determine the sequence. Specifically, it uses the formula `(1 << size + 1) - 1` to check the number of possible increasing subsequences.
   - The function iteratively builds the sequence and adjusts values to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The function correctly handles the base case when `number == 0`.
   - It uses a loop to build the sequence and recursively adjust values to match the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The assertions in the code help ensure the sequence is built correctly.

5. **Output Handling:**
   - The main loop reads the test cases and calls `func_1` to generate the sequence.
   - The sequence is printed with the appropriate length and values.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For small values of `X`, the function should produce valid sequences.
   - For larger values, the function should still produce valid sequences as long as the binary representation logic holds.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided implementation seems to correctly generate the required sequence for the given problem constraints. The function `func_1` handles the generation of the sequence based on the binary representation and ensures the correct number of increasing subsequences.
