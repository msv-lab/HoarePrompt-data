Based on the initial state provided:

- `q` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from input.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of integers from index `l-1` to `r`.
- `onesInRange` is the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]` if `l` is not equal to `r`.

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **'NO'**
