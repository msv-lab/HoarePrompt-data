The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution simply moves to the next line without changing any variable values. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` and `r` are integers from input split by space, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.**
