Output State: **`count` is 0, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", `balance` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `balance` to 0. The initial values of `count` and `expression` remain unchanged. Therefore, `count` is still 0, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `balance` is now 0.
