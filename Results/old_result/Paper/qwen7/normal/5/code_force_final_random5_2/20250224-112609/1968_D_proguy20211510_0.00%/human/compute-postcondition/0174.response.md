Output State: **`founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, and `b` has an additional element which is the maximum value of `maxa`.**

The code appends the value of `maxa` to the list `b`. Since `maxa` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know it has been added to `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
