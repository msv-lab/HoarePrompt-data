Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `f` is the second integer input minus 2, `k` is the third integer input minus 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`, and the list `a` is sorted in descending order. If `a[k] < x`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In simpler terms, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition because neither the if part nor the else part changes the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, or `x`. The list `a` remains sorted in descending order.
