### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. This means we need to find a distribution of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for each } i \]

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function computes the absolute value of the product of two numbers divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - Mathematically, it calculates \(\frac{|a \cdot b|}{\gcd(a, b)}\).

2. **Function `func_2(numbers)`**:
   - This function takes a list of integers and applies `func_1` successively to the first three elements.
   - If the list has fewer than four elements, it returns the cumulative result of applying `func_1` up to the available elements.
   - The function summary states that it returns the LCM of the first three elements if the list has at least three elements, otherwise, it returns the cumulative result of applying `func_1`.

#### Evaluation:
- The problem requires us to find a distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.
- The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address this requirement. They compute the LCM of the multipliers, which is not relevant to the problem's constraints.

#### Example Test Case:
Consider the test case:
```
3
3 2 7
```

- The expected output is:
  ```
  27 41 12
  ```

- Running `func_2([3, 2, 7])`:
  - `func_1(3, 2) = 6`
  - `func_1(6, 7) = 42`
  - The result is 42, which is the LCM of 3, 2, and 7.

This result does not help in finding the required distribution of bets. The LCM calculation does not ensure that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not meet the requirements of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
