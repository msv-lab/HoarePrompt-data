Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" and returns a new string. This new string is constructed by selecting characters from `s` based on the sorted order of their corresponding positions in the cumulative count of parentheses. Specifically, it first calculates the cumulative count of parentheses, removes the last position from the dictionary, sorts the dictionary by its values, and then constructs the result string by concatenating characters from `s` at the sorted positions.**
