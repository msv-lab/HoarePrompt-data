Let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `start_year` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `start_year` is defined as:
     \[
     start_year = (((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]
     \]
   - `x` is defined as `len(nums) - 1`.
   - `num_tests` is defined as `num_tests - 3`.
   - `nums` is a non-empty list.

2. **Understanding the Calculation:**
   - Let's assume `nums` is a list with three elements, say `nums = [a, b, c]` (since the formula involves three divisions and multiplications).
   - The expression inside `start_year` can be broken down as follows:
     \[
     start_year = (((0 // a + 1) * a // b + 1) * b // c + 1) * c
     \]
   - Since `0 // a` results in `0` (assuming `a` is non-zero), the expression simplifies to:
     \[
     start_year = ((0 + 1) * a // b + 1) * b // c + 1) * c
     \]
     \[
     start_year = (1 * a // b + 1) * b // c + 1) * c
     \]
     \[
     start_year = (a // b + 1) * b // c + 1) * c
     \]
     \[
     start_year = ((a // b + 1) * b // c + 1) * c
     \]
   - This further simplifies to:
     \[
     start_year = ((a // b + 1) * (b // c) + 1) * c
     \]

3. **Final Value of `start_year`:**
   - Without specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `start_year`. However, we know it is calculated based on the formula above.

Given the initial state and the formula, the value of `start_year` is determined by the specific values in `nums`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is calculated as (((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2])**
