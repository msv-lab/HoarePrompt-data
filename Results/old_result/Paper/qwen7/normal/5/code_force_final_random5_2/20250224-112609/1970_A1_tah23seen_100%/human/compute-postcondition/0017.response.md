Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range of the length of `s`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `s`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `s`. Given that `i` is now 2, the loop will continue as long as `2 < len(s)`.

6. **Adjust the states**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will be 2. The other states (`s`, `n`, `d[2]`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 2, and `d[2]` is either 2 or `d[1] - 1` depending on whether the second character of `s` is "(". If the second character is "(", `d[2]` is 2. If the second character is ")", `d[2]` is `d[1] - 1`.**
