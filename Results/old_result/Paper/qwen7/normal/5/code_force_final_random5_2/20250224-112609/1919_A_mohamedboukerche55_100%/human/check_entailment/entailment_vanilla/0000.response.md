### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The key observation here is that the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob wins. If it is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains the values of `a` and `b` separated by a space.
   - It splits the string `s` into a list and converts the first and second elements to integers, assigning them to `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'. Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins.
   - The code handles multiple test cases as expected.
   - The implementation matches the problem statement and the examples provided.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

**Correctness: **True**
