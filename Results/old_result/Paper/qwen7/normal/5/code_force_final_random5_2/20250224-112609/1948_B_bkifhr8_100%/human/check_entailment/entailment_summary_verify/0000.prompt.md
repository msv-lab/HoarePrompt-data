You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and then \( n \) integers. It checks if the sequence of integers can be adjusted so that for every pair of consecutive elements where the second element is smaller than the first, the first element can be updated to match the smallest possible value formed by concatenating and sorting the digits of both elements. If such adjustments can be made for all pairs, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array needs to be transformed multiple times to achieve a sorted order. Specifically, consider the input:

```
4
12 3 45 67
```

- The initial array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
- After applying the operation to `45`, the array becomes `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.
- Next, applying the operation to `67` results in `[12, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

However, the program only checks once if the array is sorted after each operation and does not continue checking further transformations. This leads to the program incorrectly returning "NO" for this case, as it does not account for the possibility of further operations making the array sorted.
