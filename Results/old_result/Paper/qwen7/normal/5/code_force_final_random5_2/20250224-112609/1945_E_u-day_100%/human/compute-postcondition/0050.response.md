Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). The function returns an element from the list arr at index k-1.**

This means the function takes a list `arr` which is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, along with two integers `n` and `k`. It then returns the element at index `k-1` in the list `arr`.
