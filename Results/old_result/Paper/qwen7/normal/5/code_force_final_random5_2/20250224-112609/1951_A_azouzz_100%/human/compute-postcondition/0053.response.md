Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a new string input by the user.
- `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the new string `s`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`.

Output: **NO**
