Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `len(s)`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")"
   - `n` is the length of `s`
   - `i` is 0
   - `d[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether the first character of `s` is "("

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(len(s))`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < len(s)`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `len(s)` remains unchanged within the loop.
   - The value of `d[1]` does not change within the loop based on the provided information.

5. **Next Iteration State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `len(s)` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - `d[1]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, and `d[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether the first character of `s` is "("**.
