Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop that runs `kreker` times.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not implemented. This is incorrect because the function is called inside the loop without any implementation.

3. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - Inside the loop, the program attempts to read two integers `n` and `m` for each test case using `map(int, input().split())`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints 'Yes', otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Now, let's consider the actual logic required to solve the problem:
- To determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to check if `n` (total moves) can be split into additions and subtractions such that the net result is `m` cubes.
- Since each move either adds 1 cube or removes 1 cube, the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` must match. Specifically, `n - m` must be even because each addition and removal cancels out in pairs.

Given this, the current program is incorrect because:
- It does not account for the parity check.
- The function `func_1()` is not defined and should be implemented to perform the necessary logic.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
