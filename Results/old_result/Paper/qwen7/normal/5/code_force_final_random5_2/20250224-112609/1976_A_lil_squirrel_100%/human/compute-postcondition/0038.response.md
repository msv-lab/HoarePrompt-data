Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `i` is an integer where `i` is 1 and less than `len(password) - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(password) - 2` (since `range(len(password) - 1)` generates values from 0 to `len(password) - 2`).

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - If `i` is 1 (as per the initial state), then the next value of `i` would be `2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `len(password) - 1`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `i` and the loop will continue if `i < len(password) - 1`, we need to update `i` to `2`.
   - The other conditions (`i` being an integer, `i` being 1 and less than `len(password) - 1`) need to be maintained.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is now 2.
- `i` must still be an integer.
- `i` must be less than `len(password) - 1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `i` is an integer, `i` must be less than `len(password) - 1`**
