### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the split data to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`a`).
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining periodicities, calculating the next year when the next sign will occur. This calculation is done correctly by ensuring the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The line `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`. This is equivalent to:
     ```python
     next_year = ((last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i]) * a[i]
     ```
   - This logic is correct because it finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Storing Results:**
   - The final year for each test case is stored in the `results` list as a string.

5. **Output:**
   - The program writes the results to stdout, joining them with newlines.

### Detailed Explanation

- **Input Reading:**
  - The program reads all input at once, which is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
  - It processes each test case one by one, extracting the necessary information (number of signs and their periodicities).

- **Calculation of Next Year:**
  - The formula used to calculate the next year is correct. Specifically, the expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
  - This is mathematically equivalent to:
    ```python
    next_year = ((last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i]) * a[i]
    ```
  - This ensures that the next year is correctly calculated based on the periodicity of the current sign.

- **Storing Results:**
  - The results are stored in a list and converted to strings before being joined and printed. This is consistent with the problem requirements.

- **Output:**
  - The program outputs the results correctly, with each result on a new line.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The calculations and logic are sound and match the problem requirements.

### Final Answer
