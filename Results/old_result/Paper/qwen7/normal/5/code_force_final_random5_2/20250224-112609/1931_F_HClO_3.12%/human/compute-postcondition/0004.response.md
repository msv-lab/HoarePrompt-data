Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and equals 1, and we take an input from the user.**

The `input()` function is called without any argument, so it will wait for user input. However, since no specific value is assigned to any variable within the code snippet, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the program is now waiting for user input.
