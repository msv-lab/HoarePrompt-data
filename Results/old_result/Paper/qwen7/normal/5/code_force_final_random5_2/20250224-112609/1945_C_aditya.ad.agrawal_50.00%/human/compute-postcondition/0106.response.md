Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second-to-last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 2, `o_r` is either 0 or -1, `z_r` is either 0 or 1, and `b_d` is recalculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`**.

Explanation: The line `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. Since `pos` was initially equal to `ans + 1`, after the increment, `pos` becomes `ans + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
