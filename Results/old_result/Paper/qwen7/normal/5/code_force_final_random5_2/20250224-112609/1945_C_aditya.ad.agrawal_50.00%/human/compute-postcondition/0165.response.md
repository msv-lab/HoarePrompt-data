Output State: **`arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_l` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `z_l` is increased by 1.**

The code `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
