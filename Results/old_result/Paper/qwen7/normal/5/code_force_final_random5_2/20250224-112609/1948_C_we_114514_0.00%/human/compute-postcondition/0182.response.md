Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are boolean values.
   - If `row2[j] == '>'`, then `reachable_first_row` becomes False and `reachable_second_row` becomes True.
   - If `row2[j] != '>'`, then `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged, `reachable_second_row` becomes True.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is equal to `n`.

4. **Determine the Next Values**:
   - Since `j` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j = n + 1`.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are not directly controlled by the loop, so their values remain the same unless explicitly changed within the loop body.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.
   - `j` must be `n + 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are boolean values, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n + 1`**
