Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    cnt = []
    for k in M.keys():
        if M[k] == 1:
            cnt.append(k)
    if len(cnt) >= 2:
        cur = cnt[1]
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` is a list. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, then `cur` is equal to the second element of the list `cnt`. Otherwise, no change occurs to `cur` and `cnt` remains as it was before the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `M` contains keys whose values were initially set to 1 and were decremented until they became 0. For each key `k` in `M` where `M[k]` was originally 1, `k` will be appended to `cnt` once for each iteration of the loop that `M[k]` is 1. `cnt` will be a list containing all such keys repeated according to their occurrences in `M`. The length of `cnt` is now greater than or equal to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` will contain all keys `k` from the dictionary `M` where `M[k]` equals 1, in the order they were added. The variable `cur` will be the highest value present in the list `N`. The dictionary `M` will only contain keys that are present in `N` with a count of 1. All other values in `M` will be zero or represent counts of numbers less than `cur` in `N`. The list `N` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order. The variable `T` is decreased by the total number of iterations the loop executed. If the sum of all values in `M` equals `S`, `cur` is increased by 1; otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` and `M`. If `len(cnt)` is greater than or equal to 2, `cur` is set to the second element in the list `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
