Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is \(i + 2\), `x \% 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether `x` is even, the loop runs up to `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is incremented by 2 and remains within the loop constraints; otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.
