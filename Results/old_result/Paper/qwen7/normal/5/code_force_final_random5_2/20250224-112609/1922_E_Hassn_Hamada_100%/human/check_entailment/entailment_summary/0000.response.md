Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to generate an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The provided solution uses a recursive approach to build this array.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that corresponds to a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses bitwise operations to determine the structure of the sequence needed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - The base case of the recursion (`number == 0`) returns two zeros, which indicates the end of the recursive process.
   - The function iterates backward from the maximum possible value to determine the appropriate size and value to add to the sequence.
   - The recursive call adjusts the `number` and updates the sequence accordingly.

3. **Execution Summary**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `number` is zero.
   - The loop in `func_1` correctly identifies the necessary values to add to the sequence.
   - The recursive call ensures that the sequence is built in a way that matches the required number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles large values of `X` up to \(10^{18}\) by using bitwise operations, which are efficient.
   - The sequence generation logic ensures that the resulting array has the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence followed by the sequence itself.
   - If it is not possible to generate a sequence with the exact number of increasing subsequences, it prints `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to generate the required sequence for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
