Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer, `k` is the integer obtained from the second part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer, and if `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then either `n` equals `k` or `n` does not equal `k`.**
