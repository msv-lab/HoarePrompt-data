The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (indicating the number of test cases), an integer `n` (the size of the subsequent list), and a list `T` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a list `a` where each element is the cumulative sum starting from 1000. It then prints a string of these cumulative sums in space-separated format for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
