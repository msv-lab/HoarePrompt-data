Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer \( x \) (where \( 2 \leq x \leq 10^{18} \)). For each test case, it repeatedly divides \( x \) by 2 when \( x \) is even, or decrements \( x \) by 1 when \( x \) is odd, counting the number of steps required for \( x \) to reach 1. It then prints the total number of steps and a list of integers representing the values of a variable \( ans \) at each step, starting from a high value and decreasing by 1 for each step, with the list reversed. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
