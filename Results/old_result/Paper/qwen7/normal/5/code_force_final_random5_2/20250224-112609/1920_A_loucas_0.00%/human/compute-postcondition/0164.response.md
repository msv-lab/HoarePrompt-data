Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1; `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`; `num` is equal to `i`; `i not in no` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The code `num = i` updates the value of `num` to be equal to the current value of `i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. The condition `i not in no` must still hold true. The value of `iterable2` remains unchanged and is equal to `innerLoop - 1`.
