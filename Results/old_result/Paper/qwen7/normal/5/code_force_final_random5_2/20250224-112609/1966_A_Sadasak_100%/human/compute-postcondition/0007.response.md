Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element.
   - `num` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `frequency_table` is a dictionary.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr`.
   - For each `num` in `arr`, if `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, the value of `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in `frequency_table` regarding `num`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the first element of `arr` at the start of the current iteration, after processing `num`, the next element in `arr` will be the second element.
   - The `frequency_table` does not change based on the condition given in the loop, so it remains the same.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `arr` will now be the list starting from the second element (since `num` was the first element).
   - `num` will be the second element of `arr`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers starting from the second element, `num` is the second element of `arr`, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary**.
