Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 3 * n + 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index - n - 1]`, `t` is t - 1, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`**

Explanation:
- The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`.
- This does not change the value of `data`, `index`, `arr`, `n`, `t`, or the contents of `arr` (which is already updated).
- The value of `result` remains the same as the return value of `func_1(arr)`.
- The value of `results` now contains one more element, which is the current value of `result`.
