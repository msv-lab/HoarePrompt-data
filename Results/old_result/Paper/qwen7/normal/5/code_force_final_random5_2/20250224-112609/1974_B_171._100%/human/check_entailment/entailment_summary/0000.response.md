Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into parts using `split()`. This allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.
   - It then calls the `func_1` function to decode the string.
3. **Decoding Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function first finds all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It creates a dictionary (`char_map`) where each unique character is mapped to its corresponding character in the mirrored sorted order of unique characters.
   - If the number of unique characters is odd, the middle character maps to itself.
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

Given the execution summary and the provided program, the logic appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for any valid input as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
