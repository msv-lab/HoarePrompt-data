Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the string `s` by spaces and converting the first part to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from splitting the string `s` by spaces and converting the second part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, s.split())` splits the string `s` by spaces and converts the resulting substrings to integers, assigning them to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
