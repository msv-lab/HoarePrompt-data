Output State: **The program returns the string `decoded`, which is the result of replacing each character in the original `encoded` string using the mappings defined in `char_map`.**

This means that the program returns the `decoded` string, where each character in the original `encoded` string has been replaced according to the mappings specified in `char_map`. The length of the unique characters in `char_map` is less than or equal to `i`, and the mapping is defined such that `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` equals `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]` for all valid `j`.
