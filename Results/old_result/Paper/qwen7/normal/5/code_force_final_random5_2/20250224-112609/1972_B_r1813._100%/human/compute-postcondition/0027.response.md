Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `s` is now the string `data[6]`, `index` is 8, `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the string `s`**

Explanation: The code `s = data[index + 1]` updates the variable `s` to be the string `data[index + 1]`. Since `index` was originally 7, `index + 1` is 8, so `s` is now `data[6]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
