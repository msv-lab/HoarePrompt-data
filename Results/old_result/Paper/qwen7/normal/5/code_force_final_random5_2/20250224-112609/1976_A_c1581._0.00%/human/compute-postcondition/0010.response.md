Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over each character in the `password` string. Therefore, the loop head variables are `char` and `password`.

2. **Understand the initial conditions**:
   - `password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - If the first character of `password` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing that digit.
   - Otherwise, `password` starts with a lowercase Latin letter, and `letters` is a list with one additional element being that letter.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `password`, the variable `char` will change with each iteration.
   - The variable `password` itself does not change; it remains the same throughout the loop.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `char` will be the next character in the `password` string.
   - If the first character was a digit, `digits` will either remain the same (if the current character is not a digit) or grow if the current character is a digit.
   - If the first character was a letter, `letters` will either remain the same (if the current character is not a letter) or grow if the current character is a letter.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `char` will be the next character in the `password` string.
- If the first character of `password` was a digit, `digits` will either remain the same or grow if the current character is a digit.
- If the first character of `password` was a letter, `letters` will either remain the same or grow if the current character is a letter.

Since we don't know the exact content of `password` beyond the first character, we'll keep the general conditions but update `char` accordingly.

**State:**
- `char` is the next character in the `password` string.
- `password` remains a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- If the first character of `password` was a digit, `digits` is a list containing that digit.
- If the first character of `password` was a letter, `letters` is a list with one additional element being that letter.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`char` is the next character in the `password` string, `password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, if the first character of `password` was a digit, `digits` is a list containing that digit, otherwise `letters` is a list with one additional element being that letter.**
