Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ones[i]` will contain the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to each index `i`, and `sum[i]` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index `i`, adjusted by subtracting 1 at each step.

In more detail:
- `ones[i]` will be the total number of 1s in the `nums` list from index 0 to index `i`.
- `sum[i]` will be the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` from index 0 to index `i`, but each element is decremented by 1 before adding to the cumulative sum.

This means that after the loop completes, `ones[n]` will give the total count of 1s in `nums`, and `sum[n]` will give the adjusted cumulative sum of the elements in `nums`.
