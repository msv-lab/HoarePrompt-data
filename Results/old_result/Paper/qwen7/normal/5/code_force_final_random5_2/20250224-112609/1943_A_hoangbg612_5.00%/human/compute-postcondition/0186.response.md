Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `cur` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and it is the smallest index `i` such that `M[i] > i`, or it is equal to the length of `M` if no such index exists.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `cur` will hold the smallest index `i` where the condition `M[i] > i` is true. If there is no such index in the list `M`, then `cur` will be equal to the length of `M`. The loop increments `i` from 0 up to but not including `cur`, checking the condition `M[i] <= i` each time. If the condition is met, `cur` is updated to `i`, and the loop breaks. If the condition is never met throughout the loop's execution, `cur` remains unchanged from its initial value.
