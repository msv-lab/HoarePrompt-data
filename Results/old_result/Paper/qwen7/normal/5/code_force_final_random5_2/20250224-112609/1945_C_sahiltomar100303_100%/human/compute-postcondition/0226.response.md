Output State: **`leftZero` is equal to `leftZero - 1` and is still less than half of `left + 1`, `left` is equal to `mid` and is still greater than 0, `rightOne` is still less than half of `n - left + 1`, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially less than half of `left + 1`, after decrementing by 1, it remains less than half of `left + 1`. The other conditions and the value of `s[left - 1]` remain unchanged.
