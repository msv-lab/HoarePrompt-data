Output State: **`M[cur]` is increased by 1, `N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `num` is the next element in the list `N`, and `cur` is the current value being tracked**.

Explanation: The code increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
