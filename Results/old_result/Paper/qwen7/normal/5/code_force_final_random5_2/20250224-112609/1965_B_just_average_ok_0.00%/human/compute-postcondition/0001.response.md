Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, so it is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
