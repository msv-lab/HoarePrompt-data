Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input using `input()`, which is now set to `sys.stdin.read`, and splits it into a list of strings using `split()`. This list is stored in the variable `data`. The variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases, remains unchanged and is still a positive integer. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100, and `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], but these details are not affected by the given code snippet.
