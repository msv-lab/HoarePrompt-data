Output State: **`num_of_lens` contains the frequency of each integer in `num_list`, `res` is 0, `total_count` is equal to the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**

The code `res = 0` sets the variable `res` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
