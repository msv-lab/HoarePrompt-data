Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter. Specifically, the program checks if the digits are sorted and if the letters are sorted, but it does not ensure that no digit appears after a letter. For example, consider the password `123abc`. The program would incorrectly return "YES" for this password because it checks the sorted order of digits and letters separately without ensuring the relative order between digits and letters.
