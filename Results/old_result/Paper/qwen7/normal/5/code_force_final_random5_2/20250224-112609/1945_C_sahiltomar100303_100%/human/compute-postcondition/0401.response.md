Output State: **`left` is now `left - 2`, `leftZero` must be less than \((left + 1) // 2\), and `rightOne` must be less than \((n - left + 1) // 2`; `leftOne` is now `leftOne - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Since `left` was already decremented by 1 before this line, it is now `left - 2`. The conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code snippet.
