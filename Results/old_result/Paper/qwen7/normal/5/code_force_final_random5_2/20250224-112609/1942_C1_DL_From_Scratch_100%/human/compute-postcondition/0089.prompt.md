Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, the first line of the input contains three integers n, x, and y, where n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    list0 = sorted(list0)
    count = 0
    for i in range(x - 1):
        num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
    num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
    if num == 1:
        count += 1
    print(count + x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `count` is equal to `x`, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `i` is `x-2`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, and if `num` equals 1, then `count` is updated to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the if-else block executes, `i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, and `count` is incremented by 1 if `num` equals 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `- (x - 2) + list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, `count` is `x - 2`. If `num` equals 1, then `num` remains 1. Otherwise, the conditions of the variables remain as per the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
