Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summaries provided.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Function Summaries
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. This is a necessary component for solving the problem but is not sufficient by itself.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The summary suggests that the function calculates the sum of `x // y + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, where `x` is `n - (m * m - m)` and `y` is `m * m`. If this sum equals 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated sum. This does not align with the problem requirements.

### Detailed Evaluation
Let's break down the logic of `func_2` and see if it correctly counts the valid pairs.

#### Test Case Analysis
Consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
- The expected valid pairs are: \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((5,1)\), \((6,1)\), \((6,2)\), \((6,3)\), \((7,1)\), \((8,1)\), \((9,1)\), \((10,1)\), \((10,2)\), and \((10,3)\).
- There are 14 valid pairs, as mentioned in the problem description.

However, the function `func_2` does not correctly iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a formula that does not match the problem requirements.

#### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided function `func_2` does not do this.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
