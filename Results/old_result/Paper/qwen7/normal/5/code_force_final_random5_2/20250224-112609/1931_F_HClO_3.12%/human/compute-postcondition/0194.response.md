Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1` with `p1` being 1, or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1` with `idx2` being 0 and `p2` being 1.
