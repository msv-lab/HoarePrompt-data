Output State: **`greater_count` is either 2 or 3, `same_value_count` remains unchanged, and `a` must have at least one element**

Explanation: The value of `greater_count` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if it was initially 2, it becomes 3. The value of `same_value_count` remains unchanged, and the condition that `a` must have at least one element is still valid.
