Postcondition: `founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 0. Additionally, if `foundb` is True, then `b` has an additional element which is the maximum value of `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, then either `a[pb - 1]` is appended to list `b` if it equals `maxa`, or `pb` is the element at index `pb - 1` of list `a` and this element is appended to list `b`.
