Output State: `data` remains unchanged, `index` is `index + 3 * n + 2 + n`, `t` is `t - 3`, `arr` is updated to be `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with three additional elements which are the results of each iteration, i.e., `results` contains the final list of results after all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `data` stays the same, `index` will be at the position right after the last processed array, `t` will have decreased by the total number of iterations (which is 3), `arr` will contain the last processed list of integers, `result` will hold the result of the last call to `func_1(arr)`, and `results` will be a list containing the results from each iteration of the loop.
