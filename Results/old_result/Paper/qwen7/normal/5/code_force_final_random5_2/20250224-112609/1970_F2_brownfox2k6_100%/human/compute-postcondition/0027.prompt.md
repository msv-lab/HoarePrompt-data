You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the current time step in the game. player is a dictionary mapping player identifiers (e.g., 'R0', 'B0') to their current positions (as a list of two integers [x, y]), and blud is a list of positions (as a list of two integers [x, y]) representing the current positions of the Bludgers.
def func_2(t):
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: `out` is a list containing keys of players whose positions matched any position in `blud` at least once during the loop iterations, `t` is an integer representing the final time step after all iterations, `player` is a dictionary where the positions of players that matched `blud` have been updated to `[-1, -1]`, and `blud` remains unchanged.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning every player whose position matched any position in `blud` at least once during the loop iterations has been printed as 'ELIMINATED'. The variable `t` now represents the final time step after all iterations have completed. The variable `out` is empty because all players that needed to be eliminated have been processed. The variable `player` remains unchanged, with positions of players that matched `blud` set to `[-1, -1]`. The variable `blud` also remains unchanged.
    #
    #In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state shows that all players whose positions matched any position in `blud` have been eliminated and printed as such. The list `out` is now empty since no more players need to be processed. Variables `player` and `blud` remain in their original states.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the current time step, a dictionary `player` mapping player identifiers to their positions, and a list `blud` of Bludger positions. It does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
