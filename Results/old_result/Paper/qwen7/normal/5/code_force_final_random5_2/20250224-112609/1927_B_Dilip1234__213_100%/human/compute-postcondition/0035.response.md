Postcondition: **`char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 2`, `char_count` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `s` is the string `s` plus the character corresponding to index `j` in the alphabet. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `char_count[j]` is updated to `a[i] + 2`, `s` is updated to include the character corresponding to index `j` in the alphabet, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`, then no changes are made.**
