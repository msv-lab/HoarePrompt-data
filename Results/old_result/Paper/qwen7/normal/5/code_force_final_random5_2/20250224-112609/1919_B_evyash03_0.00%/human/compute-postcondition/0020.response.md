Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `char` which iterates over each character in the string `expression`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the string `expression` to process.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `count` is either 0 or 1.
   - `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-".
   - `balance` is 0 if the first character in `expression` is '-', and `balance` is 1 if the first character in `expression` is '+' and the condition `balance < 0` is met.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `expression`, the `expression` string itself does not change; it remains the same.
   - The variable `char` will take the next character from `expression`.
   - The `count` variable will increment by 1 because the loop will execute once more.
   - The `balance` will be updated based on the current character `char`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `count` will be incremented by 1.
   - `expression` remains unchanged.
   - `balance` will be updated according to the current character `char`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `count` will be 1 (if it was 0 before) or 2 (if it was 1 before).
- `expression` remains the same.
- `balance` will be updated based on the current character `char`.

Since the exact value of `balance` cannot be determined without knowing the current character `char`, we can only say that `balance` will be updated accordingly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`count` is either 1 or 2, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+", "-", `balance` is updated based on the current character `char`**.
