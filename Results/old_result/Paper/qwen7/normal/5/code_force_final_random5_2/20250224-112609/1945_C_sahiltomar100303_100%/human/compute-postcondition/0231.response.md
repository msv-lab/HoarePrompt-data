Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1`, and `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged.
