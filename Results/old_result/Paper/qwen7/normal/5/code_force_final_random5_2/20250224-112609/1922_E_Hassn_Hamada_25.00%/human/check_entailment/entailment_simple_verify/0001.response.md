### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`).
   - The array length should be at most 200.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence based on the input number.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.
   - The key logic in `func_1` involves binary representation and manipulation to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Binary Representation Insight:**
   - The function uses binary representation to determine the sequence. Specifically, it uses the formula `(1 << size + 1) - 1` to check the number of possible increasing subsequences.
   - The function iteratively builds the sequence and adjusts values to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The function correctly handles the base case when `number == 0`.
   - It uses a loop to build the sequence and recursively adjust values to match the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - However, the provided implementation has a critical flaw in the recursive call and the way it manipulates the sequence.

5. **Recursive Call and Sequence Manipulation:**
   - In the recursive call `result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, the function is supposed to adjust the sequence to match the new `number`. However, the sequence is not being updated correctly.
   - The assertion `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` is checking the bounds of the sequence index, but the sequence is not being modified as expected in the recursive call.
   - The line `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` is intended to adjust the sequence, but it does not correctly reflect the required changes to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For small values of `X`, the function might produce valid sequences due to the base case handling.
   - For larger values, the function will likely fail to produce the correct sequence because the recursive adjustments are not properly implemented.

7. **Output Handling:**
   - The main loop reads the test cases and calls `func_1` to generate the sequence.
   - The sequence is printed with the appropriate length and values, but the sequence itself may be incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided implementation does not correctly generate the required sequence for the given problem constraints. The function `func_1` has a logical flaw in how it manipulates the sequence during the recursive call, leading to incorrect results for many values of `X`.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
