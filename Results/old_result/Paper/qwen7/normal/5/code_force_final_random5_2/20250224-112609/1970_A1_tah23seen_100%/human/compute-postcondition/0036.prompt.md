You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is such that `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, and `d[n]` is the net balance of parentheses in the string `s`. This net balance is calculated as follows: starting from `d[0] = 0`, for each character in `s`, if it is "(", `d` is incremented by 1, and if it is ")", `d` is decremented by 1. Therefore, `d[n]` will be the difference between the number of "(" and ")" in the string `s`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `d[n]` will be the final value of the depth counter after processing all characters in `s`, indicating how unbalanced the parentheses are in the string. If `d[n]` is positive, there are more "(" than ")". If `d[n]` is negative, there are more ")" than "(". If `d[n]` is zero, the parentheses in `s` are balanced.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `d` is an empty list, `i` is -1, and `ans` is the concatenation of all characters from the string `s` as per the indices specified by the tuples in the original `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns an empty string since the list 'd' is empty and there are no indices to concatenate characters from the string 's'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns an empty string since the list `d` is empty and there are no indices to concatenate characters from the string `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns an empty string since the list 'd' is empty and there are no indices to concatenate characters from the string 's'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
