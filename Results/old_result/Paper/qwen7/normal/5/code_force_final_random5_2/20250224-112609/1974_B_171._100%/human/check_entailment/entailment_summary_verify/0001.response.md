### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It initializes the index to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it correctly reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b` and then processes the encoded string `b` to decode it using the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an encoded string `b` as input.
   - It correctly identifies all unique characters in `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `unique_chars`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character. If the number of unique characters is odd, the middle character maps to itself.
   - It then decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its mapped value from `char_map`.

4. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The logic to create the `char_map` is correct. It maps each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.
   - The decoding process using the `char_map` is also correct. Each character in the encoded string `b` is replaced by its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

5. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are correctly stored in the `results` list and printed out one by one.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accurately performs the required mapping and decoding.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly decodes the encoded strings according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
