Output State: `i` will be equal to `n`, `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of all digits in the decimal representation of `n`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will eventually reach the value of `n`. During each iteration of the loop, the code adds the integer value of each digit in the string representation of `i` to `sum_value_digits`. Since `i` starts from 1 and increments through all numbers up to `n`, `sum_value_digits` will accumulate the sum of all digits from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the final value of `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of the digits of all numbers in the range from 1 to `n`.
