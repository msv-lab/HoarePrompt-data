Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i_new + 1`
- `n` remains the same
- `ul` remains the same

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is defined as `i_new + 1`. This means `i` is one more than `i_new`.
- `a` is a list, but its contents are not specified.

The print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the list `a` and the index `i`.

Output: **a[i] a[i]** (where `a[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `a`, and `i` is `i_new + 1`)
