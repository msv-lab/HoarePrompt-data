Output State: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `leftOne` is increased by 1, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `right` must be less than `n`, `trightZero` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `trightOne` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

This means that the value of `leftOne` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously stated values. The conditions involving `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` in relation to `right` and `n` still hold true as per the initial state.
