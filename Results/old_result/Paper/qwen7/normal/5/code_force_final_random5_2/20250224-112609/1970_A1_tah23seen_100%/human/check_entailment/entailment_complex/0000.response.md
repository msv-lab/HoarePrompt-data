Reasoning:

1. The provided code correctly implements the logic to perform the balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence.
2. The function `func_1` first computes the balance of the prefix up to each position in the string `s` and stores these balances in a dictionary `d`.
3. The dictionary `d` is then sorted based on the balance values and positions, ensuring that the characters are reordered according to the required criteria.
4. The resulting string `ans` is constructed by concatenating characters from `s` using the sorted indices from `d`.
5. The final output is returned as the balanced shuffle of the input string.

Given the steps and the logic implemented in the code, the function appears to be correctly implementing the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
