Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j` and the condition `range(n + 1)`. This means `j` will iterate from 0 to `n`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that if `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` will contain the value of `j` appended to it. If `q[j]` is not greater than 0, `eta` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `q[j]` is greater than 0.
   - `eta` now contains the value of `j` appended to it.

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is iterating through `range(n + 1)`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The condition `q[j]` will be checked again. If `q[j]` is still greater than 0, `eta` will be updated to include `j + 1`. Otherwise, `eta` will remain unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - `eta` will either remain unchanged or be updated to include `j + 1` based on the condition `q[j + 1] > 0`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`q[j + 1]` is greater than 0, and `eta` now contains the value of `j + 1` appended to it if `q[j + 1]` is greater than 0; otherwise, `eta` remains unchanged.**
