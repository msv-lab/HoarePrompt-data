Output State: **`i` is a positive integer, `x` is the last digit of `i` after converting `i` to a string and iterating through each character, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[i]` is `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `values` list such that `values[i]` is the sum of `values[i - 1]` and `sum_value_digits`. Here, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits of `i`, and `x` is the last digit of `i` after converting `i` to a string and iterating through each character. The values of `i`, `x`, and `sum_value_digits` remain unchanged from their initial state, but the `values` list is updated according to the given formula.
