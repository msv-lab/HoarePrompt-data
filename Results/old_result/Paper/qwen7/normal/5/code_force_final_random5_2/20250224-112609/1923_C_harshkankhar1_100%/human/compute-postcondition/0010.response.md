Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is 1, `b[1]` is 2, `b[2]` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a[i]` is greater than 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2` checks if `a[i]` is greater than 1. Since `i` is 3 and the precondition is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, it implies that `a` is at least a list of size 3. However, the actual value of `a[3]` is not given, but we can infer that the condition `a[i] > 1` must be true because the code sets `x` to 1. Therefore, `x` remains 1, and no other variables are affected.
