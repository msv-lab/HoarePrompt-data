### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at the `l`-th position when it ends.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is defined with the following steps:
   - Initialize `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
   - While `r - l > 1`, calculate `m = ⌊(r + l) / 2⌋`.
   - If `p_m <= x`, set `l = m`. Otherwise, set `r = m`.

3. **Goal**: We need to ensure that `p_l == x` after the binary search is executed. This means we need to place `x` in the position where the binary search would find it.

4. **Swapping Strategy**:
   - **Case 1**: If `x` is already in the permutation, no swaps are needed.
   - **Case 2**: If `x` is not in the permutation, we need to find the closest element to `x` and swap it with `x`. After the first swap, we might need to swap again to ensure `x` is in the correct position.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The given code does not implement the binary search algorithm or the swapping logic.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are utility functions for reading input, which are not used in the provided solution.
   - There is no logic to determine the necessary swaps or to perform the binary search.

6. **Conclusion**: The provided program does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
