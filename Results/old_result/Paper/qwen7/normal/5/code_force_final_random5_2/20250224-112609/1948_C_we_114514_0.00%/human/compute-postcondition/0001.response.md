Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head:**
   - The loop iterates over `test_cases`.
   - The loop variable is `test_case`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects:**
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions.

3. **Understand what the loop does:**
   - For each `test_case` in `test_cases`, the loop body is executed.
   - Each `test_case` is a tuple containing an even integer \(n\) (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and two strings of length \(n\), where each string consists only of '<' and '>' characters.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `test_cases`, the only relevant object in the loop head is `test_case`.
   - The loop can execute as long as `test_cases` is not empty.

Given this analysis, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `test_cases` is not empty, because if `test_cases` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `test_cases` must not be an empty list.**
