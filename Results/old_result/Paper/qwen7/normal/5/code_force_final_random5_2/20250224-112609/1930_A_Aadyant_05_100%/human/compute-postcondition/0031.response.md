Output State: **`s` is 0, `num` is the previous value of `num` incremented by 1, `list1` is an empty list, `a` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code creates an empty list named `list1`. This operation does not affect the values of `s`, `num`, `list2`, or `a`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
