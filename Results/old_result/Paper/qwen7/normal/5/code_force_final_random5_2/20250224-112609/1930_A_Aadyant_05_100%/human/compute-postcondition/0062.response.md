Output State: **`b` is an input string, `list2` is an empty list with an additional element `int(a)`, `s` is 0, `final` is a list containing one element which is `s`, `num` is incremented by 1, `a` is an input string, `list1` is a list of words from the string `b` that must have at least one word.**

Explanation: The code `list2.append(int(a))` appends the integer value of `a` (converted from the string `a`) to the list `list2`. All other variables remain unchanged. `b` is still an input string, `list2` now contains the integer value of `a`, `s` remains 0, `final` is still a list containing `s`, `num` is incremented by 1, `a` is still an input string, and `list1` is still a list of words from the string `b` that must have at least one word.
