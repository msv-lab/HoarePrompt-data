Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is halved from its current value, `k` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`. If the condition `s < k and k <= s + x` is true, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.
