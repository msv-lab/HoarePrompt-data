Output State: **`i` is 4; `x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer from input; `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(int(input()), int(input()))`**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the list `coord` is updated to contain a tuple of the new values of `x` and `y`. Since the exact input values for `x` and `y` are not specified, they are described as "an integer from input".
