Output State: **`low` is `mid`, `high` is greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2`, `mid`, and `mid`.**

Explanation: The line `low = mid` updates the value of `low` to be equal to the current value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
