Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` updates the value of `res` by adding the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.
