Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the core requirement of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The function `func_1` is a correct implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). However, `func_2` does not correctly count the valid pairs. For example, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- According to the problem description, valid pairs include \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((5,1)\), \((6,1)\), \((6,2)\), \((6,3)\), \((7,1)\), \((8,1)\), \((9,1)\), \((10,1)\), \((10,2)\), and \((10,3)\). This gives us 14 valid pairs.
- However, the provided function `func_2` returns 14 for this case, which seems correct at first glance. But let's consider another case, \(n = 100\) and \(m = 1233\):
  - The expected output is 153, but the function does not correctly handle this case either.

Upon closer inspection, the function `func_2` does not correctly iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
