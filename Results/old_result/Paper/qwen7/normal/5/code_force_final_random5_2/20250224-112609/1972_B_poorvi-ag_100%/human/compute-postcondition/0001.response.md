Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D"; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. Since `t` and `s` were defined before the code snippet and their values remain unchanged, they are still as described in the initial state. The new list `results` is created but is currently empty.
