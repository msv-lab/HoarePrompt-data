Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for value in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `value` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. For each iteration, `value` takes the next element from the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `value` is the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` is unchanged during the loop execution.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `value` is set to the next element in the list `a` at the start of each iteration, it will be the next element in the list `a` for the next iteration.
   - The list `a` remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new state should reflect that `value` is now the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`value` is the next element in the list `a`**
