Output State: **`match_c` is True, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `match_c` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is now dependent on the user's input. The condition that `t` must be greater than 0 is not affected by this code snippet.
