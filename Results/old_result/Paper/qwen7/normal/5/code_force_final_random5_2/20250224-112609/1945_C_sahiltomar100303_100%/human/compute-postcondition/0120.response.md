Postcondition: `right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to its previous value plus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `trightOne` is decreased by 1. `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right]` is '0'. Additionally, `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` still holds.
