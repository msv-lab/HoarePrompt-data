The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables but simply skips to the next iteration, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from `k=len(a)-1` down to `k=1`, `i` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `j` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` with `i` being the last updated index, `t2` is `abs(a[n - m] - c[m - 1])`, `a` is sorted in descending order, and `n`, `m`, `c` are as initially defined.**
