Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ret` is 0, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input, `thorn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is a character from the list, `thorn` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. If `i` is '@', `thorn` remains 0 and `ret` is 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is either 1 (and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `thorn` equals 2) or 0. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list, and `thorn` is either 2, 1, or 0. If `i` equals '@', `thorn` becomes 0. If `i` equals '*', `thorn` becomes either 2 or 1 depending on its original value (0 or 1). If `i` does not equal '*' or '@', `thorn` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list, and `thorn` is either 3, 2, 1, or 0. If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is set to 0 and `ret` is set to 1. Otherwise, `thorn` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
