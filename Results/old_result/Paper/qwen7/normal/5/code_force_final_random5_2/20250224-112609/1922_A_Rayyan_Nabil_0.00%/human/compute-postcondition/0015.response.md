Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and `l` is 'YES'. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then these conditions hold true. If the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is false, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
