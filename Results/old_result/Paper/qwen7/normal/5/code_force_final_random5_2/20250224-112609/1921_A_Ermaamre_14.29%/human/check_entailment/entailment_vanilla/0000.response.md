Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly computes the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `a` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, and `(x4, y4)`.

2. **Identifying Opposite Sides**:
   - The program checks if the given points form a square by comparing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points.
   - It assumes that if two points have the same x-coordinate, they are either horizontally aligned, and if they have the same y-coordinate, they are either vertically aligned.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not account for all possible configurations of the square's corners.

3. **Calculating Side Length**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between the y-coordinates when the x-coordinates are the same, and vice versa.
   - This approach is incorrect because it only considers one pair of opposite sides and does not ensure that the calculated value is indeed the side length of the square.

4. **Area Calculation**:
   - The program squares the calculated side length to get the area of the square.
   - Since the side length calculation is incorrect, this step will also be incorrect.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the example provided:

```
3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```

- For the first test case, the coordinates are:
  - (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
  - The side length should be 3 (distance between (1, 2) and (4, 2) or (1, 5) and (4, 5)).
  - However, the program incorrectly calculates the side length as 3 (distance between (1, 2) and (1, 5)).

- For the second test case, the coordinates are:
  - (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
  - The side length should be 2 (distance between (-1, 1) and (-1, -1) or (1, -1) and (1, 1)).
  - However, the program incorrectly calculates the side length as 2 (distance between (-1, 1) and (1, 1)).

- For the third test case, the coordinates are:
  - (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
  - The side length should be 28 (distance between (45, 11) and (17, 11) or (45, 39) and (17, 39)).
  - However, the program incorrectly calculates the side length as 28 (distance between (45, 11) and (45, 39)).

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly identify the side length of the square and therefore cannot compute the correct area. Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
