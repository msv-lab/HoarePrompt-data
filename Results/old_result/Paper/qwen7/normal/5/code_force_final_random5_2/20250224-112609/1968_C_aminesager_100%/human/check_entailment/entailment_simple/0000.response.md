Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).
2. The annotated program initializes `a` with `[1000]` and then updates it based on the input values. Specifically, for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), it sets \(a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]\).
3. This approach ensures that \(a_i > a_{i-1}\) for all \(i\), which guarantees that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} < a_{i-1}\). Since \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) and \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\), the chosen values of \(a_i\) will satisfy the condition \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
4. The program correctly processes each test case independently and prints the resulting array \(a\) for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
