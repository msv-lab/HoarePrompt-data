Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` against the problem description and the function summary.

### Analysis of `func_1`:

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` processes a password string and checks two main conditions:
     - All digits in the password must be in ascending order.
     - All letters in the password must be in alphabetical order.
   - It also checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter, which is a critical condition according to the problem statement.

2. **Checking Conditions**:
   - **Digits in Ascending Order**: The function collects all digits and checks if they are sorted using `sorted(digits)`.
   - **Letters in Alphabetical Order**: Similarly, it collects all letters and checks if they are sorted using `sorted(letters)`.
   - **No Digit After Letter**: The function iterates through the password and ensures that no digit appears after a letter. This is done by maintaining a `last_digit_index` variable, which keeps track of the last digit found. If a letter is encountered after a digit, the function immediately returns 'NO'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles both cases where the password consists only of digits or only of letters correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the password alternates between digits and letters correctly by ensuring that no digit comes after a letter.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Digits in Ascending Order**: The function correctly checks if the digits are in ascending order.
- **Letters in Alphabetical Order**: The function correctly checks if the letters are in alphabetical order.
- **No Digit After Letter**: The function correctly checks if there is no digit that comes after a letter.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly handle the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter. However, upon reviewing the code, we can see that the function `func_1` explicitly checks for this condition by maintaining a `last_digit_index` and returning 'NO' as soon as it encounters a letter after a digit.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly implements all the required conditions.

Final: **True**
