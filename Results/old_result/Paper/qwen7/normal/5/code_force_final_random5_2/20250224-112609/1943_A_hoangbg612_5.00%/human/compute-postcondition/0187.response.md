Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all iterations, `cur` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `cur` is the smallest index `i` such that `M[i] > i`, or it is equal to the length of `M` if no such index exists.

Given this information, the value of `cur` depends on the content of the list `M`. If there exists an index `i` where `M[i] > i`, then `cur` will be the smallest such index. Otherwise, `cur` will be equal to the length of `M`.

Since the exact list `M` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `cur`. However, we know that `cur` will be an integer that satisfies one of the two conditions mentioned above.

Output: **cur (where cur is the smallest index i such that M[i] > i, or the length of M if no such index exists)**
