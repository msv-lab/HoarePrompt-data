Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user, representing the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user, which represents the number of test cases. This integer is stored in the variable `t`. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged, but since no other variables are mentioned or modified in the given code snippet, they retain their unspecified initial conditions. The only updated variable is `t`, which now holds the integer input from the user.
