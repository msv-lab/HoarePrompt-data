Output State: `b` is an input string, `list2` is a list of integers converted from all words in `b`, `s` is 0, `final` is [0], `num` is incremented by the number of words in `b`, `a` is an input string, `list1` is a list of words from the string `b`.

In this final output state, `list2` contains all the integer values converted from the words in the input string `b`. The variable `s` remains 0 as it was not modified within the loop. The `final` list still contains just one element, which is `s`. The variable `num` is incremented by the number of words in `b` because the loop runs once for each word in `b`. `a` remains an input string, and `list1` is the list of words from the string `b`.
