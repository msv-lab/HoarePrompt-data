Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`.**

The code `o = arr.count(1)` counts the number of occurrences of the integer 1 in the list `arr` and assigns the result to the variable `o`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
