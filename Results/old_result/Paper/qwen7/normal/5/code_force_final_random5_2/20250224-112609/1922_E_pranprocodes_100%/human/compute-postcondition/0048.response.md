Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `x`, `max`, or `min`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new variable `ans` is introduced as an empty list.
