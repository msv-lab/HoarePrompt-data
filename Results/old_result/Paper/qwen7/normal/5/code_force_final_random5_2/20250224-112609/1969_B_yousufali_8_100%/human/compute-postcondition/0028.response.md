Output State: `s` is an input binary string, `n` is equal to the total number of '1's in `s`, `ans` is the sum of each block of '0's plus one, and `i` is the index right after the last character of `s`.

To explain this in more detail:
- The variable `n` keeps track of the number of '1's encountered so far.
- The variable `ans` accumulates the count of each block of '0's plus one. This means if there are two consecutive '0's, it contributes 3 to `ans` (2 '0's plus 1).
- The variable `i` is the index of the current character being processed in the string `s`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, indicating that all characters have been processed.
- `n` will be the total count of '1's in the string `s`.
- `ans` will be the sum of the lengths of all blocks of '0's plus one for each block.
