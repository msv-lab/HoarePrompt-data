Output State: **Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block indicated, the `break` statement simply indicates that we exit the current context. The values of the variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n`, `m`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain as they were in the initial state, except that we know we have exited the current block of code.
