Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Handling Edge Case:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if `k` is greater than the number of cards, no exchanges can be made, so the number of cards remains unchanged.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. It attempts to limit the frequency of each card to `k` if it exceeds `k`, but this does not align with the problem statement. The goal is to minimize the number of cards, not to limit the frequency to `k`.

4. **Determining Minimum Cards:**
   - After calculating the frequencies, the program checks if `k` is present in the frequency table.
   - If `k` is in the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

### Issues Identified:
- The function `func_1` incorrectly limits the frequency of each card to `k` if it exceeds `k`, which is not required by the problem.
- The logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed. The program should consider how many groups of `k` cards can be formed and then calculate the remaining cards accordingly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly:
1. Group the cards by their numbers.
2. For each group, determine how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed.
3. Calculate the remaining cards after forming these sets.

### Revised Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Count the frequency of each card number
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] += 1

    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += (count // k) * (k - 1) + (count % k)

    print(min_cards)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function and the incorrect approach to determining the minimum number of cards. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
