Output State: **`k` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` and `j` have been appropriately incremented, and the loop has completed all iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and stores them in the list `a`. The variables `k`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `k` remains the length of the list `a`, and `ans` retains its cumulative maximum values calculated during the iterations.
