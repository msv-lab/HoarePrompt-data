### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function Definitions and Inputs:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It returns a map object, which is later converted to a list in `func_2`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function converts the map object returned by `func_1` into a list.
   - It does not directly take any parameters; instead, it relies on the variables set by `func_1`.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function takes no parameters directly but relies on the global variables `n` and `k` set by `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - It performs a binary search to find the position of `k` in the permutation `arr`.
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it prints `0`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, where `pos` is initially -1 and remains unchanged.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at various points.
- The binary search logic in `func_3` is indeed flawed. The variable `st` is unnecessary and does not affect the outcome.
- The main issue lies in the binary search loop:
  - The loop updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `k`.
  - However, the logic to ensure that `p_l` (which is `arr[0]` in the context of the binary search) becomes `x` is missing.
  - The current implementation only updates `low` and `high` but does not ensure that the permutation is rearranged to place `x` at the start.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- **Input**:
  ```
  6 3
  6 5 4 3 2 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  2
  1 6
  2 3
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  0
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - The number `3` is present in the permutation, but the program does not perform any swaps and incorrectly outputs `0`, meaning it does not rearrange the permutation to make `p_l` equal to `x`.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The binary search logic is flawed, and the program does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` by performing the necessary swaps.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
