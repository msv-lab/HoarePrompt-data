Output State: `i` is 26, `j` is 25, `n` must be greater than 26, `s` is the string 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy' repeated three times, which is 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy', and `char_count` is a list where `char_count[3]` is 3, `char_count[4]` to `char_count[25]` are each 3.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be 26, `j` will be 25, `n` must be greater than 26, `s` will contain the string 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy' repeated three times, and `char_count` will have each value from index 3 to 25 incremented by 3.
