Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`; `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `curr` to 0. The values of `total`, `n`, and `mean` remain unchanged from their initial state since no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet.
