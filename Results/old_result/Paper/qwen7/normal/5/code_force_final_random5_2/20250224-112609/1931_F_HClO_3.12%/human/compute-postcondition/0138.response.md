Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `a3` and `l3`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple in `val`. Each tuple contains `a3` and `l3`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `m` is greater than 1.
   - `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer.
   - `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers.
   - `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples, each tuple being (`a3`, `l3`).
   - `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that includes all elements of `l` except `a3`.

4. **Determine the Next Tuple in `val`**:
   - Since `val` contains `m-2` tuples, and assuming the loop has already processed one tuple, there are `m-3` tuples left to process.

5. **Update the States**:
   - After processing one tuple, `a3` remains the same as it was initialized before the loop.
   - `l3` will now be the second tuple in `val`, which means `l3` will be the list of the remaining integers after the first two integers have been processed.

Given this information, the updated state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `m` is still greater than 1.
- `a3` remains the same as the first integer from the input.
- `l3` is now the list of the remaining integers after the first two integers have been processed.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`m` is greater than 1, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers after the first two integers have been processed**.
