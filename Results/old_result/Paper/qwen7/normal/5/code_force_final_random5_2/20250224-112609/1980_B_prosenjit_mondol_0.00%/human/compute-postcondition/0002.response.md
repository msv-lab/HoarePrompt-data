Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `f` is decreased by 1.**

The code subtracts 1 from the value of `f`. Since `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected, their states remain unchanged. The output state clearly indicates that `f` has been decreased by 1.
