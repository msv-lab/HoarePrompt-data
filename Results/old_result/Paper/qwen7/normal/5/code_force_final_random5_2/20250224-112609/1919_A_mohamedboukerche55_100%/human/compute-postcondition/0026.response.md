Postcondition: **`s` is the new input string, `a` is the first integer from the new input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the new input string `s` converted to an integer, `t` must be at least 1, and `i` is `i + 2`. If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, no changes are made to `t` and `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t` and `i` as well.**
