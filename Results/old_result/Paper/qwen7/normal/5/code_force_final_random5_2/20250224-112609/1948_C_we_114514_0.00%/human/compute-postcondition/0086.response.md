Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is 1. Since the if condition `(reachable_second_row)` is true, the current state remains the same: `reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is 1.
