Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a list of n zeros, `nums[0]` is equal to (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1.**

Explanation: The code sets the first element of the list `nums` to the value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. Here, `k.bit_length()` gives the number of bits necessary to represent `k` in binary form, excluding the sign bit. The expression `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` calculates the largest number that can be represented with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits, which is a number consisting of all 1s in its binary representation up to the length of `k.bit_length() - 1`. Therefore, `nums[0]` is set to this value. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
