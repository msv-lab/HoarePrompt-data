Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `l` is `[ans, i + 2, x // i]`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` (integer division of `x` by `i`) to the list `l`. Given the initial state where `i` is `i + 2` and `l` is `[ans, i + 2]`, the list `l` now includes the new value `x // i`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged.
