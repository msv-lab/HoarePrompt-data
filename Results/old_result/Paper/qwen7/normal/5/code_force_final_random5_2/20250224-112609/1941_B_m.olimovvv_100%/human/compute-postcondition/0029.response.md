Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `a` is an integer greater than 3.
   - `b` is a list of integers where:
     - The second element is 0.
     - The third element is 0.
     - The fourth element is the original fourth element minus the second element.
     - The fifth element is the original fifth element minus twice the first element.
     - This process continues until the end of the list.
     - If the last two elements are both 0, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop head is:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the state of the input variable used in the loop condition.

4. **Input Variable**: The loop condition uses `int(input())` to determine how many times the loop should run. Therefore, the state of the input variable (which is an integer) needs to be adjusted.

5. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop is controlled by the input value, the input value itself should be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- The input value is decremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is a list of integers where the second element is 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is the original fourth element minus the second element, the fifth element is the original fifth element minus twice the first element, and this process continues until the end of the list. If the last two elements are both 0, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO', and the input value is decremented by 1**.
