Output State: **`arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_l` may be increased by 1, `o_r` may be decreased by 1, and `ans` is equal to `pos`; `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`.**

This output state reflects that the value of `b_d` is now set to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`, while all other variables retain their previous values or potential changes as described.
