### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to compute the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal and prints the result.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - It first finds the longest subarray where all elements are the same starting from the beginning (`i`).
   - Then, it finds the longest subarray where all elements are the same starting from the end (`j`).
   - If the entire array is already uniform, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum cost between two scenarios:
     - Changing the entire array except the prefix of length `i`.
     - Changing the entire array except the suffix of length `j`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like when the entire array is already uniform or when the array is uniform from the start or end but not both.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the correct minimum cost for making all elements of the array equal.

However, there are some issues with the logic implemented in `func_1`:

- **Incorrect Calculation of `i` and `j`**:
  - The function `func_1` only checks for uniformity from the start and end of the array but does not consider the possibility of uniform segments within the array.
  - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the function would incorrectly set `i` to 0 and `j` to 5, assuming the entire array needs to be changed, which is not optimal.

- **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
  - The function does not account for the possibility of multiple uniform segments within the array.
  - For example, in the array `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`, the function would only consider changing the entire array, missing the opportunity to change just the segment `[1, 2]`.

To fix these issues, the function should:
- Find the longest uniform segment from the start and end of the array.
- Check for any other uniform segments within the array.
- Calculate the minimum cost by considering all possible uniform segments.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly handle all possible uniform segments within the array. The provided solution does not guarantee the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
