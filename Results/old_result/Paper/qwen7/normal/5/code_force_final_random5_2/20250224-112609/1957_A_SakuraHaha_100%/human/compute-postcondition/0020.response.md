Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `ans` is initialized to `ans + sum(cnt.values())`, but since `ans` is not defined initially, it will be `0` if no previous value is assigned.
   - `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`. For each iteration, the count of the current `x` (the last element from the list `a`) is incremented by 1.
   - `x` is the last element from the list `a` with `cnt[x]` incremented by the total number of iterations.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

Given the initial state, let's analyze what `ans` would be:

- `ans` starts as `0` because it is not explicitly defined otherwise.
- `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`. The last element `x` of the list `a` is counted multiple times, with its count incremented by the total number of iterations.
- The expression `ans + sum(cnt.values())` adds the sum of all counts in `cnt` to `ans`.

Since `ans` starts as `0` and `sum(cnt.values())` represents the total count of all elements in `a` (which is essentially the length of `a`), `ans` will be the length of `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the length of the list `a`.

Output: **len(a)**
