Output State: **`coord` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (x, y), the second tuple is (x, y), and the third tuple is (x, y); `i` is 3; `p1` is the squared distance between the second and the first points in `coord`; `p2` is the squared distance between the fourth and the third points in `coord`.**

Explanation: The initial state of `coord` is a list containing three tuples, each representing a point (x, y). The variable `i` is set to 3, and `p1` is the squared distance between the second and the first points in `coord`. The code snippet calculates `p2` as the squared distance between the fourth and the third points in `coord`. Since `coord` only contains three tuples, accessing `coord[3]` and `coord[2]` results in an IndexError. However, following the instructions to be as specific as possible and include all valid information, we note that `p2` would be calculated based on hypothetical fourth and third points if they existed. But since they don't, the output state remains as described, noting the existing structure of `coord` and the unchanged values of `i` and `p1`.
