You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

def func_1():

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n consisting only of "U" and "D".
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer minus the total number of iterations executed, `n` is the integer value of `data[3*iterations - 1]`, `s` is now the string `data[3*iterations]`, `index` is `3*iterations + 1`, `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the string `s`. After all iterations, `count_u` is the cumulative count of 'U' in all the strings processed during the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be the initial value minus the number of times the loop ran. `n` will be the integer value of the element at the position calculated as `3 * (number of iterations - 1) + 1` in the `data` list. `s` will be the last string processed, which is located at the position `3 * (number of iterations)`. `index` will be `3 * (number of iterations) + 1`. Finally, `count_u` will be the total count of 'U' characters across all the strings processed during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \), followed by \( t \) pairs of integers \( n \) and strings \( s \). For each pair, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string \( s \). If the count of 'U' characters is odd, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases where each test case has a fixed structure.

2. **Parsing Test Cases:**
   - The program iterates over the test cases, extracting the number of coins (`n`) and the state of the coins (`s`) for each case.
   - It correctly increments the index to skip over the processed parts of the input.

3. **Counting Facing-Up Coins:**
   - The program counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
   - This count is used to determine the winner.

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, the program prints "YES" (indicating Alice wins).
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" (indicating Bob wins).

### Correctness Check:

#### Problem Description:
- The game ends when no more moves can be made, and one of the players wins.
- A key observation is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') before the start of the game.
- If the number of 'U' is odd, Alice can always force a win by making optimal moves.
- If the number of 'U' is even, Bob can always force a win by making optimal moves.

#### Program Logic:
- The program correctly counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
- It then checks if this count is odd or even and prints the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:
The program logic matches the problem description and correctly determines the winner based on the initial number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the given program is correct.
