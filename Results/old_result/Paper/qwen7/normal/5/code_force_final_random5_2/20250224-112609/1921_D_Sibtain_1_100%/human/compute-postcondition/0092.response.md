Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from `k=len(a)-1` down to `k=1`, `i` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `j` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` with `i` being the last updated index, `t2` is `abs(a[n - m] - c[m - 1])`, and `a`, `n`, `m`, `c` are as initially defined. If the lengths of sets `a` and `c` are 1 and their first elements are the same, then `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions of the if part do not apply.**
