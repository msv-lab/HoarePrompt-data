Output State: **max_val is the largest value of y such that 1 < y < x and x % y == 0 and 2 * y >= x, or max_val remains 1 if no such y exists.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `max_val` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` itself and satisfies the condition `2 * y >= x`. If no such divisor exists, `max_val` remains 1.
