Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is halved from its current value, `k` is the input integer, `s` is increased by `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` multiplies the value of `m` by 2. Given that the initial value of `m` is 1, after executing this line, `m` becomes 2. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `x`) remain unchanged according to the provided initial state and the code snippet.
