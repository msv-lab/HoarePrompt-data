Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the array `c` of length `n`.
   - It then reads `q` queries, each consisting of `l_i` and `r_i`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is called for each test case.
   - It initializes `a` with a zero-padded version of the input array `c` (to handle edge cases).
   - It computes a new array `b` where `b[i]` represents the cumulative sum of a modified sequence starting from `1` if `a[i] > 1` else `2`.
   - It then computes the prefix sums of `a` and stores them in `a`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of elements in the subarray `c[l_i]` to `c[r_i]` using the prefix sums stored in `a`.
   - It also checks if the subarray is good by comparing the sum of the subarray with the corresponding value in `b`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than the corresponding value in `b` or if the subarray has only one element, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization and Prefix Sums:**
   - The initialization of `b` ensures that `b[i]` is the sum of the smallest possible values that can form the subarray `a[1:i]` while satisfying the condition \(a_i \neq b_i\).
   - The prefix sums `a` are correctly computed.

2. **Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The subarray sum calculation using `a` is correct. `a[r] - a[l-1]` gives the sum of the subarray `c[l]` to `c[r]`.

3. **Good Subarray Check:**
   - The check `if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y:` is correct. It ensures that the sum of the subarray is not equal to the corresponding value in `b` and handles the case where the subarray has only one element.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The steps are logically sound and the implementation is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
