Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1 and `m` is still a positive integer. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers entered by the user.
