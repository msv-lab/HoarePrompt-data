You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = len(array) - 1`, which means it will run `len(array) - 1` times. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(array)`, and `beauty` will be the sum of the absolute differences between every pair of consecutive elements in the `array`.
    #
    #Since the initial value of `beauty` is 0, and it gets incremented by the absolute difference between `array[i]` and `array[i - 1]` for each iteration, the final value of `beauty` will be the sum of these absolute differences for all pairs of consecutive elements in the `array`.
    #
    #For example, if `array = [1, 3, 5, 7]`, then `beauty` would be calculated as follows:
    #- First iteration: `beauty += abs(3 - 1) = 2`
    #- Second iteration: `beauty += abs(5 - 3) = 2`
    #- Third iteration: `beauty += abs(7 - 5) = 2`
    #
    #So, `beauty` would be `2 + 2 + 2 = 6` after all iterations.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: `i` is `len(array)`, and `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between every pair of consecutive elements in the `array`.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between every pair of consecutive elements in the array, and i is equal to len(array)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of the absolute differences between every pair of consecutive elements in the list. After processing, the variable `i` is set to the length of the list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and array is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9].
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be exactly 0, `index` is increased by the sum of all `n` values encountered during the loop iterations, `result` is the last return value of `func_1(array)` computed during the loop, `results` is a list containing all the `result` values computed during each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because it was decremented with each iteration until it reached 0. The `index` variable will have been incremented by the total number of elements processed (sum of all `n` values). Each `result` computed during the loop is appended to the `results` list, making `results` contain the outcomes of all iterations.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` must be 0, `index` is the sum of all `n` values encountered during the loop iterations, `result` is the last return value of `func_1(array)` computed during the loop, `results` is a list containing all the `result` values computed during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from standard input, then calls another function `func_1` to compute a result based on this list. It collects all these results into a list and prints them out. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the number of remaining test cases (`t`) is 0, the `index` variable is updated to reflect the total number of integers read, and it outputs the computed results for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this, we should arrange the elements such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty using the sorted array.
   - Sorting ensures that the smallest element is paired with the largest possible next element, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
   - It iterates through the sorted array and computes the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach is correct because sorting allows us to maximize the beauty as explained.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases and outputs the results.
   - The logic inside `func_2` is also correct as it properly uses `func_1` for each test case.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: Input: `3 2 1 3`
  - Sorted array: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Beauty: \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\)

- **Example 2**: Input: `3 69 69 69`
  - Sorted array: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0\)

- **Example 3**: Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
  - Sorted array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Beauty: \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\)

- **Example 4**: Input: `4 3 4 3 3`
  - Sorted array: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Beauty: \((3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)

- **Example 5**: Input: `2 2 1`
  - Sorted array: `[1, 2]`
  - Beauty: \((2 - 1) = 1\)

All these examples are handled correctly by the provided functions.
