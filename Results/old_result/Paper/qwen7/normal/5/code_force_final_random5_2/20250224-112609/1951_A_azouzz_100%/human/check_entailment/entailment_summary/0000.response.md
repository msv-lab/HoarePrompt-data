Reasoning:
1. The given program consists of two separate functions: `generate_files_for_html_in_range` and `func_1`.
2. The execution summary describes the behavior of `func_1`, which is not related to the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.
3. The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is responsible for generating `.py` files in specific subfolders that contain `.html` files within a specified range of folder names.
4. The execution summary does not mention anything about file generation or checking for `.html` files, which are the primary operations of `generate_files_for_html_in_range`.
5. Since the execution summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1` and does not provide any information contradicting the behavior of `generate_files_for_html_in_range`, we can conclude that the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is correctly implemented according to its intended purpose.

Correctness: **True**
