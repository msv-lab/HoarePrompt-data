You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: pos remains -1, i is 9, n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is the result of the function func_2().
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: Output State: `low` is either `mid` from the last iteration where `arr[mid] <= k`, `high` is `n` if `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` from the last iteration, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2`, `mid` from the second iteration, and `mid` from the third iteration. The set `st` will contain all the mid values calculated during the iterations of the loop.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the variable `low` will be the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or it will be equal to `high` if `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`. The variable `high` will be `n` if the loop exits because `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`. The variable `mid` will hold the last calculated midpoint value. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the iterations of the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: n, 0
    #State: `low` is either the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or it is equal to `high` if `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`. `high` is `n` if the loop exits because `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`. `mid` holds the last calculated midpoint value. `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2`, `mid` from the second iteration, and `mid` from the third iteration. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `low` is adjusted based on the comparison between `arr[low]` and `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). The function returns an element from the list arr at index k-1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
