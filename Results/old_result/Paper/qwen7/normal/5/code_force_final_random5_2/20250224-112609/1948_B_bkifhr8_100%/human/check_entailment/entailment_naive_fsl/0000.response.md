Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array needs to be transformed multiple times to achieve a sorted order. Specifically, consider the input:

```
4
12 3 45 67
```

- The initial array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
- After applying the operation to `45`, the array becomes `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.
- Next, applying the operation to `67` results in `[12, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

However, the program only checks once if the array is sorted after each operation and does not continue checking further transformations. This leads to the program incorrectly returning "NO" for this case, as it does not account for the possibility of further operations making the array sorted.
