Output State: **`t` must be at least 0, `index` is increased by `n + int(data[index]) + 1` and then further increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains `result`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `results` list has one more element which is `result`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the `result` to the `results` list. No other changes are made to the variables. The `results` list now contains the `result` as its last element. All other conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
