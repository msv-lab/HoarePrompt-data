Postcondition: `greater_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and `same_value_count` remains unchanged as it equals the total number of times `value` in list `a` matches `favorite_value`. In both cases (whether `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k` or less than `k`), the postcondition holds true.
