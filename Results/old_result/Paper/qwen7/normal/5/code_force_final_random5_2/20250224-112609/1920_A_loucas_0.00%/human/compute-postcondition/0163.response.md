Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(max(big), min(less))`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `max(big)`, and `min(less)`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`.
   - The postcondition from the previous iteration is that `i not in no` must still hold true.
   - Additionally, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, and `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`.

3. **Determine the New Values:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration (as it is part of a `range`), the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - The values of `max(big)` and `min(less)` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `innerLoop` must still be greater than 0, and `iterable2` should be updated to `innerLoop - 1`.

4. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` + 1.
   - `max(big)` and `min(less)` remain the same.
   - `innerLoop` must still be greater than 0.
   - `iterable2` should be updated to `innerLoop - 1`.

Given the previous iteration's state:
- `innerLoop` must be greater than 0.
- `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`.
- `i` is the current value of `num`.
- `i not in no` must still hold true.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be the previous value of `i` + 1.
- `iterable2` will be updated to `innerLoop - 1` (which remains the same unless `innerLoop` changes).

Since `innerLoop` must still be greater than 0, and `iterable2` remains the same, the new state is:

State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, and `i not in no` must still hold true.**
