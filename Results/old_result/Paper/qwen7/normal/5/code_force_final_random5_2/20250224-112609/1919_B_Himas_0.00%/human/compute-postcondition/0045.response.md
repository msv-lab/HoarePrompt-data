Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `q` and `e`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `e`. After each iteration, `q` takes the value of the current character being processed, and `e` becomes a string that is one character shorter than before.

3. **Postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `e` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before).
   - `q` is the new last character of `e`.
   - If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 more than its original value.
   - Otherwise, `M` is increased by 1.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `e` is one character shorter after the previous iteration, it will be two characters shorter in the next iteration.
   - `q` will be the last character of the updated `e`.
   - If `q` is '+', `P` will be 1 more than its original value.
   - Otherwise, `M` will be increased by 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `e` will be two characters shorter than its original length.
   - `q` will be the last character of the updated `e`.
   - `P` or `M` will be adjusted based on the value of `q`.

Given the postcondition and the nature of the loop, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State:**
- `e` is a non-empty string (two characters shorter than before).
- `q` is the new last character of `e`.
- If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 more than its original value.
- Otherwise, `M` is increased by 1.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`e` is a non-empty string (two characters shorter than before), `q` is the new last character of `e`, if `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 more than its original value, otherwise `M` is increased by 1**.
