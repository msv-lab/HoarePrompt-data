Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, and the current value of `l[i]` is 2, the current value of `l[i + 1]` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `j` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, and the specific values of `l[i]` and `l[i + 1]` remain unchanged.
