Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is 0.
- `leftZero` is either 0 or 1.
- `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`.
- `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring.
- The current value of `right` is `n`.
- `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - right`.
- `trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - (n - right)`.

We need to determine the value of `right` when the `print(right)` statement is executed.

From the initial state, it is explicitly stated that the current value of `right` is `n`.

Therefore, the value of `right` that will be printed is `n`.

Output: **n**
