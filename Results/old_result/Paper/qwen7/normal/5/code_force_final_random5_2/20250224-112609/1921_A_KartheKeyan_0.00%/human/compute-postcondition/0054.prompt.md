Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is 0, `i` is 4, `x` is the last input integer from the third iteration, `y` is the last input integer from the third iteration, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the fourth and third tuple in `coord`, `n` must be at least 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(4):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    coord.append((x, y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `coord` is a list containing a tuple (x, y), where x and y are integers from the input split, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `coord` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (x, y) from the input, and the second tuple is also (x, y); `i` is 0; `x` is an integer from the input split; `y` is an integer from the input split.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `coord` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (x, y) from the input, the second tuple is also (x, y), and the third tuple is (x, y); `i` is 1; `x` is updated to the first integer from the input split; `y` is updated to the second integer from the input split.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
