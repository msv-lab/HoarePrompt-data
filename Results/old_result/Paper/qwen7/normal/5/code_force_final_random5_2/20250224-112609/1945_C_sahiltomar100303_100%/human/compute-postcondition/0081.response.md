Postcondition: `s` is a string, `left` is greater than 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is incremented by 1 and `rightZero` is also incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is set to 0. Additionally, `leftZero` must still satisfy the condition of being less than (left + 1) // 2 or `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2.
