Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over each element `x` in the list `a`. Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The variable `x` will take the next element from the list `a`.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged within the loop.

3. **Initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`. For every key `x` in `cnt`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` takes the next element from `a`, `a` will still be the same list but `x` will be the next element in the list.
   - `ans` and `cnt` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, and `x` is the next element from the list `a`**.
