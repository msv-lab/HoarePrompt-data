Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(mid, n)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid + 1` and `n` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `mid + 2`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` needs to be updated to `mid + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Final State:**
   - The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `n` remains unchanged**
