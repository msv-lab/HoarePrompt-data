Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` (which is `m`) must be greater than 0, `s` is 2 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `k` (which is `m`) must be greater than 0, and `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`. After the code executes, `s` becomes `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, which simplifies to `2 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
