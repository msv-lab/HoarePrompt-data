Output State: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `leftOne` is increased by 1, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `right` is `right + 1`, `trightZero` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `trightOne` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states. The condition that either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must still hold true is preserved.
