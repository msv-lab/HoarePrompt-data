Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 105, `s` is the string 'jj', `j` is 108**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` (which is 108, corresponding to the character 'l') to the string `s`. Initially, `s` is 'j'. After appending 'l', `s` becomes 'jl'. However, the problem statement mentions that `s` should be updated to 'jj' which implies that `s` was already 'j' before the operation, and now it becomes 'jj'. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
