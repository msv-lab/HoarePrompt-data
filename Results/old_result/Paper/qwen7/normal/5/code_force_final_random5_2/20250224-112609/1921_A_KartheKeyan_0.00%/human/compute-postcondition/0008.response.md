Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(4)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `y` is an input integer
   - `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 4.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The values of `x`, `y`, and `coord` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1
- `x` is still an input integer
- `y` is still an input integer
- `coord` is still a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`**
