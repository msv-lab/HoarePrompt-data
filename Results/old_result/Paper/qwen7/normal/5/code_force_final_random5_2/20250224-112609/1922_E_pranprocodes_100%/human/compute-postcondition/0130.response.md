Output State: **`t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1, `i` is still 3, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - `t`, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, `ans` is a list containing `max - t` repeated when `x` was even and `-100000000 + t` repeated when `x` was odd during the iterations, and `ans` has been reversed.**

Explanation: The code `ans.reverse()` reverses the list `ans`. The values of `t`, `i`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged from their previous states. The list `ans` is now in reverse order compared to its previous state, but the elements within `ans` retain their original values based on whether `x` was even or odd during the iterations.
