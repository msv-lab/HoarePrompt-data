Output State: `coord` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (x, y) from the input, the second tuple is (x, y), and the third tuple is (x, y); `i` is 3; `x` is updated to the first integer from the input split; `y` is updated to the second integer from the input split.

After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be 3 because the loop runs from 0 to 3, inclusive. The variable `x` and `y` will be updated to the values of the input split on the third iteration, as they are reassigned each time through the loop. The list `coord` will contain three tuples, each representing the (x, y) coordinates input during the respective iterations of the loop.
