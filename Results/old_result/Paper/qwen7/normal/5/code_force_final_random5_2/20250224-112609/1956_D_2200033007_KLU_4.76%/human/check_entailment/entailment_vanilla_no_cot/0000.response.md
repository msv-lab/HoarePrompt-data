Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` is hardcoded to handle only the case where `n == 2` and outputs a fixed result for that case. For other cases, it simply outputs "13 0", which is not a general solution.

To solve the problem correctly, the program needs to:
1. Calculate the MEX (Minimum Excludant) for any subarray.
2. Perform operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.
3. Output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations used to achieve that sum.

The given code does not perform these steps and instead uses hardcoded values, which will not work for all test cases.
