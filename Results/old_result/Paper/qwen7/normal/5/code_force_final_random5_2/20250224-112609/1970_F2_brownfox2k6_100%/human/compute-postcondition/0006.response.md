Postcondition: `out` is an empty list, `t` is an integer, `player` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. If the value of `p` in the `player` dictionary is equal to any element in the `blud` list, then the value of `p` in the `player` dictionary is updated to `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, the values of `out`, `t`, `player`, and `blud` remain unchanged.
