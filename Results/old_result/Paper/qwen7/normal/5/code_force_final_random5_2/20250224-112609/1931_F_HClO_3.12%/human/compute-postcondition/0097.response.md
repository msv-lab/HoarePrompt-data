Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` is 0, `l1` is a list with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `a2` remains 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is -1, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code inserts `a1` (which is 0) into the list `l1` at the index `idx2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
