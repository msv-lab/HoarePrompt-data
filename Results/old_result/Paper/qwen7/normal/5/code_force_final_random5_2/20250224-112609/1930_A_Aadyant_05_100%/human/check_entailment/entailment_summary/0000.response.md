Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`n`), but it incorrectly handles the input for each test case. Specifically, it reads `n` again instead of reading the value of `2n` integers, which is the actual length of the list for each test case.
2. **Sorting and Sum Calculation**: For each test case, the program sorts the list of integers and then sums every second element starting from the first element. This approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that the smallest elements are paired together, which is necessary to maximize the score.
3. **Logic for Maximizing Score**: To maximize the score, we need to pair the smallest available elements together at each step. Sorting the list and then summing every second element starting from the first does not guarantee this optimal pairing.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the maximum final score as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
