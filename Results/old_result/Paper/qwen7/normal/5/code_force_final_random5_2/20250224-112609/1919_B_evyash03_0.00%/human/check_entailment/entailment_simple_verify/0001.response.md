### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
- The penalty for a single array segment is \( p(c) = |c_1 + c_2 + \ldots + c_m| \cdot m \), where \( m \) is the length of the segment.
- The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all segments.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - The string `expression` is split at every '-' character, resulting in `parts`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes the string `expression` and the length of `expression` as arguments.
   - It iterates through each character in `expression`:
     - If the character is '+', it increments the `balance`.
     - If the character is '-', it decrements the `balance`.
     - If the `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` and resets `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns the `count` plus 1 if the final `balance` is greater than 0.

#### Key Points to Consider:
- The function `func_1` counts the number of times the balance becomes negative and resets to 0. This is a heuristic approach to ensure that no prefix of the array has a negative sum.
- However, this does not directly translate to the minimum penalty as defined in the problem statement.

#### Correctness of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty.
- The function `func_1` only counts the number of splits needed to ensure no prefix has a negative sum, which is not the same as minimizing the total penalty.
- The penalty calculation involves the absolute value of the sum of each segment multiplied by its length, which is not accounted for in the function `func_1`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the required penalty calculation. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
