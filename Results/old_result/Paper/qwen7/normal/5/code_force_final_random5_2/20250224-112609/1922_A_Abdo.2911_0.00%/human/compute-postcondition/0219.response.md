Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is currently 3.

3. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: The value of `n` is not explicitly stated in the provided information. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer (since `range(n)` requires `n` to be a non-negative integer).

4. **Adjust the state of `i` and `n`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 3`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 or 1 (the typical starting point for such loops) and that `n` is a positive integer to allow the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `match_c`, `a`, `c`, and `template` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `n` must be a positive integer**
