Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `same_value_count` is 0, `greater_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `a[f - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `favorite_value` is now the element `a[f - 1]`
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `same_value_count` is either 0 or 1, `greater_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `a[f - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `favorite_value` is now the element `a[f - 1]`. If the current value of `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `same_value_count` is either 1 or 3, `value` is the next element in the list `a`, `greater_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `a[f - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `favorite_value` is now the element `a[f - 1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `same_value_count` is either 2 or 4, `value` is the next element in the list `a`, `greater_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `a[f - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `favorite_value` is now the element `a[f - 1]`, and if `value` equals `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` becomes either 2 or 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
