Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers starting from the third element, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the key `num` having a value of 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the `frequency_table` such that the value associated with the key `num` is set to `k`. Given that `frequency_table` initially had the key `num` with a value of 1 more than its previous count, the value of `k` must be 2. Therefore, the updated state of `frequency_table` has the key `num` with a value of 2. The other variables (`arr` and `num`) remain unchanged.
