Output State: **`i` is the last element of the list `arr`, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `-z`, `o_r` is equal to `-o`, `b_d` remains 3, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` was last satisfied before `pos` reached the length of `arr`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
