Output State: **`k` is either 1 or 2, `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order (before the code) and then sorted in non-increasing order, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`, where `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, and `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[-1]` and `c[-1]` (or `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]` depending on the condition).**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `max(t1, t2)` to its current value. Here, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, and `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[-1]` and `c[-1]` (or `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]` depending on the condition). All other variables remain unchanged.
