Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n)` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `res` contains the element `a[1]`.
   - `l[a[1] - 1]` equals 1.
   - If `re` equals `k`, the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will increment `i` by 1 at the start of the next iteration, making `i` equal to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, so `n` stays as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Construct the New State**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` remains the same (no specific value given, but it must be such that the loop condition is still valid).

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that the loop can continue**
