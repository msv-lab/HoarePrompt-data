Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from the user, `c` is an input string, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES'. If the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is not met, the value of `l` remains unchanged.
