Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * k + c * a` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 10 ** 9 + 7.**

The code initializes the constant `M` to the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so they remain as described in the initial state.
