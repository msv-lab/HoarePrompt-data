Postcondition: `left` is now `left - 2`, `leftZero` is either less than \((left + 1) // 2 - 1\) or still less than \((left + 1) // 2\), `rightOne` is less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\), and `rightZero` is either `rightZero + 1` or remains unchanged; `leftOne` is either `leftOne - 1` or remains unchanged, and `rightOne` is either `rightOne + 1` or remains unchanged.
