Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in nums`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body increments `num_of_lens[x]` by 1 if `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, or initializes `num_of_lens[x]` to 1 if `x` is not in `num_of_lens`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `nums` is a non-empty list.
   - `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 if `x` is in `num_of_lens`, otherwise it is initialized to 1.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` (the current element being processed) must come from `nums`.
   - Since `nums` is a non-empty list, there is always at least one element left to process unless `nums` becomes empty.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `nums` remains a non-empty list because we are only removing one element at a time and the list is still non-empty.
   - `num_of_lens[x]` will be updated based on the value of `x` in the next iteration. However, since we don't know the exact value of `x` for the next iteration, we can only say that `num_of_lens[x]` will be either incremented by 1 or initialized to 1 depending on whether `x` is already in `num_of_lens`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `nums` is still a non-empty list, and `num_of_lens[x]` will be updated accordingly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nums` is a non-empty list, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 if `x` is in `num_of_lens`, otherwise it is initialized to 1**
