Output State: **`i` is greater than 0; `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`; `x` is the integer value of `a[i]` modulo 10; `y` is the integer value of `a[i]` divided by 10; and the current value of `y` is less than `c[n - 1]`; `c` is now a list with an additional element `a[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `c`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
