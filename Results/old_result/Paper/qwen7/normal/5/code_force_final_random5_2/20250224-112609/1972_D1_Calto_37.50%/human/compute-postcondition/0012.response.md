Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; `i` is `m`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`, `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**

Explanation: 
- The value of `m` remains unchanged because it is only used to initialize `i`.
- `i` is set to the value of `m`.
- `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`, which simplifies to `n - (m * m - m)`.
- `y` is calculated as `i * i`, which simplifies to `m * m`.
- `cnt` is updated by adding `x // y + (i > 1)` to its current value. Here, `x // y` is `n - (m * m - m) // m * m`, and `(i > 1)` is `True` if `m > 1` (which is true according to the initial state). Therefore, `cnt` is updated by adding `n - (m * m - m) // m * m + 1` to its current value.
