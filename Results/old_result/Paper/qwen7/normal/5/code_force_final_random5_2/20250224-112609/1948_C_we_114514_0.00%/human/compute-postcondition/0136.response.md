Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for test_case in test_cases`. The key variables here are `test_case` and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: Since the loop is iterating over each `test_case` in `test_cases`, the state of `test_case` will change with each iteration. However, the state of `test_cases` itself does not change; it remains the same list of test cases.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `reachable_first_row` is a boolean value (True or False).
   - `reachable_second_row` is a boolean value (True or False).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is equal to `n - 1`.
   - `results` contains either 'YES' or ['NO'] depending on the conditions met within the loop.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `n` and `j` will be adjusted based on the loop's execution but are not directly relevant to the loop head.
   - `results` will be updated based on the loop's execution but is not directly part of the loop head.

5. **Conclusion**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `test_case`. Since `test_case` is being iterated over from `test_cases`, the next `test_case` will be the one after the current one.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next `test_case` in the list.

**Answer**:
State: **`reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True or False, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and `results` contains either 'YES' or ['NO'] depending on the conditions met within the loop, and `test_case` is the next test case in `test_cases`**.
