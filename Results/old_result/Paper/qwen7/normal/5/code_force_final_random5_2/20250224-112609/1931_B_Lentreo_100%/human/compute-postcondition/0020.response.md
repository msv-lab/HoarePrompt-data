Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition is based on `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state:**
   - `total` is equal to the sum of `nums`.
   - `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0.
   - The sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`.
   - `mean` is `total` // `n`.
   - `curr` is `nums[1] - mean + nums[2] - mean`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - The loop either returns 'NO' if `curr` is less than 0, or does nothing if `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Analyze the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `total`, `mean`, `curr`, and other variables not in the loop head remain unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `i` should be 4.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0).
   - `total` remains the sum of `nums`.
   - `mean` remains `total` // `n`.
   - `curr` remains `nums[1] - mean + nums[2] - mean`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is `nums[1] - mean + nums[2] - mean`, `i` is 4**
