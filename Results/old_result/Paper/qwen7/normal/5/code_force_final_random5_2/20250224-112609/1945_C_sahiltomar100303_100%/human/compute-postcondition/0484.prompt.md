Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if left != 0:
            print(left)
        elif tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop, `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop, `left` is 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then either `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or the condition `(rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2)` is false. If `left` is 0, and `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. If the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, then `right` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2` or greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - right`, and `trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - (n - right)`. If `left == 0`, then the condition `left == 0` is true. Otherwise, if `right == n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2` or greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right != n`, the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2` or the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is greater than the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is between 0 and the total number of '0's from `mid` to the end of the string `s`, inclusive, `leftOne` is between 0 and the total number of '1's from `mid` to the end of the string `s`, inclusive, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `right` is equal to `n`, `trightZero` is less than or equal to `rightZero`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `rightOne`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` hold true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
