You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
    return max_val



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer \( x \) where \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \). It searches for the largest integer \( y \) such that \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2y \geq x \). If no such \( y \) exists, it returns \( x - 2 \) or \( x - 3 \) depending on the values found during the search. If no valid \( y \) is found through these checks, it returns the largest \( y \) satisfying the conditions or 1 if no such \( y \) exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and the value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - If multiple values of \( y \) satisfy this condition, any one of them can be returned.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The main function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1(x)` to find the optimal \( y \).
   - `func_1(x)` is supposed to find the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

3. **Function `func_1(x)` Analysis:**
   - It initializes `max_val` to 1.
   - It iterates over \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \% y == 0 \) (i.e., \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \)).
   - If \( y \) is a divisor and \( 2 * y \geq x \), it returns \( y \) immediately.
   - Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to the current \( y \).
   - Finally, it returns `max_val`.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( x = 2 \): The only possible \( y \) is 1. Since \( 2 * 1 < 2 \), the loop won't execute, and it returns `max_val` which is 1. This is correct.
   - For \( x = 3 \): Possible \( y \) values are 1 and 2. \( \gcd(3, 2) + 2 = 3 \) is greater than \( \gcd(3, 1) + 1 = 2 \). The function correctly returns 2.

2. **General Case:**
   - Consider \( x = 10 \):
     - Possible \( y \) values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
     - \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \) is the highest value among all possible \( y \).
     - The function correctly returns 5.
   - Consider \( x = 21 \):
     - Possible \( y \) values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
     - \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 39 \) is the highest value.
     - The function correctly returns 18.

3. **Algorithm Logic:**
   - The logic of checking if \( 2 * y \geq x \) ensures that we find the largest possible \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - The loop structure ensures that we check all possible divisors of \( x \) in descending order, which is efficient.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal \( y \) for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
