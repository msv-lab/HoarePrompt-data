Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it uses a binary search approach on the given permutation without sorting it, which is incorrect since binary search requires a sorted array.
2. The program attempts to find the correct position for `x` in the permutation using a binary search-like approach, but it does not handle the necessary swaps to ensure the permutation is in a form where binary search can be applied correctly.
3. The program's logic for determining the swaps is flawed and does not guarantee that the correct number of swaps (no more than 2) will be used to place `x` at the correct position.
4. The functions `func_4` and `func_5` are not defined in the provided code, which means they are not part of the actual program being analyzed. This could be a mistake in the annotation.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
