The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.

Given that `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 2 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers entered by the user**
