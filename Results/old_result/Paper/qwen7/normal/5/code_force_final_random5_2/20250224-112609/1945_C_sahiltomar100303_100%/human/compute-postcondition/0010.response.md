Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0**

The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `trightZero`. Since `trightZero` was already `0` in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. The other variables (`rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, and `tleftZero`) are not affected by this assignment, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
