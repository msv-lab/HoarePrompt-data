Output State: `a` is 0; `b` is a list where the last two elements are 0 and all other elements are processed according to the loop operations; no 'NO' is printed, hence the final output is 'YES'.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (with `a` starting at least at 3), `a` will reach 0 as the loop runs from 0 to `a-3`. During each iteration, the relevant elements of `b` are updated based on the given operations. If the loop completes without any condition breaking it (like finding a negative element in `b`), the final check ensures `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are both 0, leading to the final output of 'YES'.
