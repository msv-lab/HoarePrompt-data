Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for x in num_list:`. The only variable in this loop head is `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `num_list`. The value of `x` changes with each iteration.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`num_of_lens`**: This dictionary will be updated based on the current value of `x`. Since `x` is the variable being iterated over, the dictionary might be updated in the loop body.
   - **`res`**: This variable accumulates some value based on the conditions in the loop body.
   - **`total_count`**: This variable keeps track of the sum of all values originally present in `num_of_lens`.
   - **`num_list`**: This list is used to iterate over the values of `x`.
   - **`x`**: This variable takes the next value from `num_list` in each iteration.
   - **`test_cases`**: This variable is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

Since the loop condition depends on the current value of `x` and the other variables mentioned above, we need to adjust these states for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `x` will take the next value from `num_list`.
   - `test_cases` will be decremented by 1.

Given that the loop is about to start another iteration, `x` will be the next element in `num_list`, and `test_cases` will be decremented by 1.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `x` will be the next element in `num_list`.
- `test_cases` will be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the next element in `num_list`) either has its count incremented by 1 if it was already present, or is set to 1 if it was not present before. `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `x` is the next integer in `num_list`, and `test_cases` is decremented by 1.**
