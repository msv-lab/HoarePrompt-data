Output State: **`N` is not empty, `cur` is the next element in `N`, `M[cur]` is 2**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Given that `M[cur]` initially remains 1, after executing `M[cur] += 1`, the value of `M[cur]` becomes 2. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
