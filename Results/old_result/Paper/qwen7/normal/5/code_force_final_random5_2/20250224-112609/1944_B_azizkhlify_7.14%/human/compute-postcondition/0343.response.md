Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is the next element in `res`.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i`.

Since `i` is the next element in `res` and `res` contains at least one element, `i` must be one of the elements in `res`.

Output: **the next element in res**
