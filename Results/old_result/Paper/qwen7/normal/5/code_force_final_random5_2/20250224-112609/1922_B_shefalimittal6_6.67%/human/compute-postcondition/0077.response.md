Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total_sum` to be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for `cnt`. The precondition states that `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. After executing the code, `total_sum` is recalculated according to the new definition, but the other variables remain unchanged as per the precondition.
