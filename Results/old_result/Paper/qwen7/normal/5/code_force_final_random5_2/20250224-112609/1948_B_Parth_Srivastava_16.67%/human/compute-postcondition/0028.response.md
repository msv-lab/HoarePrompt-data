Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is the remainder of `a[0]` divided by 10, the first element of `a` is less than or equal to 10, and the condition `i == 0 and a[i] > 10` is false.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(a[i] % 10)` calculates the remainder when the first element of the list `a` (which is `a[0]`) is divided by 10 and assigns it to `x`. Since `i` was initially set to 0, `i` remains unchanged. The condition `i == 0 and a[i] > 10` is false because `i` is 0 and the first element of `a` is less than or equal to 10, as per the initial conditions.
