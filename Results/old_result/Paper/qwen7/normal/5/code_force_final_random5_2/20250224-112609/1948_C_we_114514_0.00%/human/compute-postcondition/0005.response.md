Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `reachable_first_row` is initially `True`.
   - `results` is initially an empty list.
   - `reachable_second_row` is initially `False`.
   - `n` is the first element of `test_case`.
   - `row1` is the second element of `test_case`, which is a tuple.
   - `row2` is the third element of `test_case`, which is a tuple.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (i.e., `n > 0`).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
   - The other variables (`reachable_first_row`, `results`, `reachable_second_row`, `row1`, and `row2`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
