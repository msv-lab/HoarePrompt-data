Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 (which is already given).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

6. **Consider other variables**:
   - `last_year` and `next_year` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not change based on the loop condition. They remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**.
