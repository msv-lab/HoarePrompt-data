Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second-to-last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 1, `o_r` is either 0 or -1, `z_r` is either -1 or 0, `b_d` is recalculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `z_l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `z_r -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `z_r`. Since `z_r` was initially either 0 or 1, after subtracting 1, it will become either -1 or 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
