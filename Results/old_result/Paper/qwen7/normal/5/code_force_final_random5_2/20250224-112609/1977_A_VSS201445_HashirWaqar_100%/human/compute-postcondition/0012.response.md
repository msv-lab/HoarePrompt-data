Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, and `n` and `m` are converted to integers. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
