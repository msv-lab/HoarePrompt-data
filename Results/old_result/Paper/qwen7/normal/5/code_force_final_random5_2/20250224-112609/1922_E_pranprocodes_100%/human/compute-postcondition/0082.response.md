Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is adjusted based on whether `x` is even or odd, `min` is adjusted accordingly, `ans` is a list containing either 99999997 or -99990000, and `t` is 3.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`) remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.
