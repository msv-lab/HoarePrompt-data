Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` is set to `i` or `idx2` is set to `i`, `p2` is 1, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative. After executing the if-else block, if the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the variables.
