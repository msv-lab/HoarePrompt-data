Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `k`, which iterates over the keys of the dictionary `M`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are keys in the dictionary `M`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `cur` is the last element in `N` plus 1.
   - `M[cur]` is 1 if `cur` was not previously in `M`, or it is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `cur` in `N`.
   - The sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`.
   - `cnt` is an empty list.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over the keys of `M`, the only relevant state to adjust is the dictionary `M`.
   - We need to ensure that `M` has at least one key for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the dictionary `M` to ensure it has at least one key.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`M` must have at least one key**
