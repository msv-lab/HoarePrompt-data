Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value, so let's denote the new value as `i_new`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ul` remains the same (unless explicitly modified within the loop body).

The `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[i_new]` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[i_new] a[i_new]**
