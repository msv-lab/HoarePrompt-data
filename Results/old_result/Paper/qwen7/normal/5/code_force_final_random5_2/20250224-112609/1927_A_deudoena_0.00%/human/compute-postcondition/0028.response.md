Output State: **`i` is less than `len(inpstr)`, and `ind2` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `ind2`. The condition that `i` is less than `len(inpstr)` and the behavior of breaking out of the loop if `inpstr[-i - 2]` is equal to 'B' remains unchanged. Therefore, `ind2` now holds the value of `i`, and the other conditions and variables remain as they were initially.
