Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_c` remains True.
