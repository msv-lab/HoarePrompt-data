Postcondition: **`total_count` is `cnt` + 0, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair minus one, `res` is now `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * (`cnt` + 0), `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**

This postcondition summarizes that if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * (`cnt` + 0). All other variables remain unchanged as specified in the precondition and if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly reflects the changes made within the if block.
