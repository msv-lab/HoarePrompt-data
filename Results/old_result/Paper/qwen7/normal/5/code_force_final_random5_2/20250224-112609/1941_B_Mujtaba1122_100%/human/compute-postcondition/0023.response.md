Output State: **`list[i]` is now 2, `list[i - 1]` is -1 * `list[i - 1]`, `list[i + 1]` remains greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `list[i - 1]` from itself, which is equivalent to multiplying `list[i - 1]` by -1. Since `list[i - 1]` was initially 0, the operation `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` results in `list[i - 1]` becoming 0 - 0 = 0, but the correct interpretation given the multiplication is `list[i - 1]` becomes -1 * 0 = 0. However, since the initial state specified `list[i - 1]` is 0, the operation effectively sets `list[i - 1]` to 0, which is consistent with the multiplication. Therefore, `list[i - 1]` is now -1 * `list[i - 1]`, which is 0. All other conditions remain unchanged.
