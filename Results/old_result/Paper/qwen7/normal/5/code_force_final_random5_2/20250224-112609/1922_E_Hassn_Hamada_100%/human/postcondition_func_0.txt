The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `number` (where \(2 \leq number \leq 10^{18}\)) and a list of integers `sequence`. It generates a new sequence based on the input `number` and updates the `sequence` list. If `number` is 0, it returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a pair of values (`size` and `i`) and uses them to fill the `sequence` list with specific integers. Finally, it recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. The function ultimately returns two zeros, regardless of the input values.
