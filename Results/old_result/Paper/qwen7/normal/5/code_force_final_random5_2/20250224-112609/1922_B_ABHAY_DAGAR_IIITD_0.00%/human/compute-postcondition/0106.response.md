Postcondition: `res` is updated to either `2 * res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or remains as `2 * res + new_cnt * (new_cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is less than 2. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is incremented by `new_cnt`, `num_list` remains an empty list, and `test_cases` remains 0.
