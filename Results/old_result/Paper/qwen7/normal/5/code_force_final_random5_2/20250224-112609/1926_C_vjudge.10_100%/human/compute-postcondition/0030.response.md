Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `x` in the expression `for x in str(i):`. This means the only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit.
   - `x` is the current digit being processed.
   - `sum_value_digits` is the original `sum_value_digits` plus the integer value of `x`.
   - `values[i + 1]` is `values[i] + sum_value_digits`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each digit in the string representation of `i`, the next digit `x` will be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.
   - After processing the current digit `x`, the loop will proceed to the next digit. Therefore, `x` will change to the next digit in the string representation of `i`.
   - The variable `i` itself does not change within the loop; it remains the same throughout the loop iterations.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `x` changes to the next digit in the string representation of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `i` remains the same.
- `x` changes to the next digit in the string representation of `i`.

Since `i` is a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit, and `x` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit, `x` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`**
