Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `match_c` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the first character of `template` matches the corresponding character in `c` in lowercase.
   - If the characters do not match, `match_c` is set to `False` and `i` remains `1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
   - If the characters match, `match_c` retains its original value and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

Given this information, let's analyze what happens at the end of the previous iteration:

- If `match_c` was `False` (indicating no match), then `i` remained `1`.
- If `match_c` was `True` (indicating a match), then `i` could have been incremented based on the internal logic, but we don't know the exact value without the loop body details. However, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since we are asked to think step by step and only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: We need to consider the possible values of `i` and `n` based on the loop condition.
2. **Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, we can infer the following:

- If `match_c` was `False`, `i` remained `1` and the loop would continue as long as `1 < n`.
- If `match_c` was `True`, `i` could have been incremented, but for the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `1` or incremented such that it is still less than `n`.

### Final State:
- `match_c` can be either `True` or `False`.
- `i` must be `1` or incremented such that it is still less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `i` is `1` or incremented such that it is still less than `n`**.
