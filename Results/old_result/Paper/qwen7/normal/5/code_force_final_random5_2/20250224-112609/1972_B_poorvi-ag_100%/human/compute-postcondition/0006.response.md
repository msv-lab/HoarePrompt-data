Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is ['yes'], `arr` is the input string from the user. The count of 'U' in `arr` is odd.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending `'yes'`, it becomes `['yes']`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
