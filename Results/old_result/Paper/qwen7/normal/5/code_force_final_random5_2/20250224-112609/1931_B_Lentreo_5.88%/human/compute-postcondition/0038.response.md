Output State: **`nums` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element from `nums`, `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `curr` by adding the difference between the current element `i` and the last element `last` to the current value of `curr`. The initial conditions of `nums` and `i` remain unchanged, and `curr` is updated based on the new value of `i`.
