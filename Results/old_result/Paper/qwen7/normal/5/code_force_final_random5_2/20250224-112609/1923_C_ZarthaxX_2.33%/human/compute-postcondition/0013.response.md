Output State: `ones[n + 1]` is the count of 1s in the `nums` list, `sum[n + 1]` is the sum of the elements in the `nums` list minus `n`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will range from 1 to `n + 1`. The variable `ones[i]` accumulates the count of 1s encountered in the `nums` list up to index `i-1`, and `sum[i]` accumulates the sum of the elements in `nums` up to index `i-1` but subtracts `i-1` from it. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `ones[n + 1]` will be the total count of 1s in the `nums` list, and `sum[n + 1]` will be the sum of the elements in `nums` minus the length of the list (`n`).
