Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and `(n - m)` is an even number, then no change is made to `t`. If `n` is less than `m` or `(n - m)` is not an even number, then no change is made to `t`.
