Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`, `cnt` is `cnt + (n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) + ((i + 1) > 1) + x // y + (i > 1)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cnt` by adding `x // y + (i > 1)` to its current value. Here, `x` is defined as `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` is defined as `i * i`. The condition `(i > 1)` evaluates to 1 if `i` is greater than 1 and 0 otherwise. Since the exact values of `n`, `i`, and `cnt` are not specified, the updated value of `cnt` is expressed as the sum of its original value and the new additions based on the given expressions.
