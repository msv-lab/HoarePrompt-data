Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)' ; `y` is `i * i`; `cnt` is `cnt + (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `cnt` by adding the value of `x // y + (i > 1)` to its current value. Here, `x` is defined as `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` is defined as `i * i`. The term `(i > 1)` evaluates to 1 if `i` is greater than 1, otherwise it evaluates to 0. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `n`, `i`, and `cnt`, the updated value of `cnt` is expressed in terms of these variables. The conditions and values of `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
