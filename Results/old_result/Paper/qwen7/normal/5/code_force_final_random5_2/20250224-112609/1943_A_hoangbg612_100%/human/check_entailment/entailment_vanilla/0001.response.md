Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and computes the MEX of the array `c` optimally.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Sorting**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `S` of the array `N` and then reads the array `N` itself.
   - It sorts the array `N`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - A variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`, which will be used to track the current maximum value in the sequence.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in the sorted array `N`.

3. **Processing the Sorted Array**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the dictionary `M` to keep track of the counts.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

4. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - If the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` where the value is 1.
   - If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second key in the list `cnt`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Game Logic**:
   - Alice can only pick elements from `a` and append them to `c`, while Bob can only delete elements from `a`.
   - The goal is to maximize the MEX of `c` for Alice and minimize it for Bob.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program attempts to simulate the optimal strategy by sorting the array and processing it in a way that tries to maintain the smallest possible gaps between consecutive numbers in `c`.
   - However, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the turns of Alice and Bob and their respective strategies.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case `4 0 0 1 1`.
     - Alice picks `1`, `a = [0, 0], c = [1]`.
     - Bob picks `0`, `a = [0], c = [1]`.
     - Alice picks `0`, `a = [], c = [1, 0]`.
     - The MEX of `[1, 0]` should be `2`, but the program incorrectly calculates it as `1`.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the game logic and the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
