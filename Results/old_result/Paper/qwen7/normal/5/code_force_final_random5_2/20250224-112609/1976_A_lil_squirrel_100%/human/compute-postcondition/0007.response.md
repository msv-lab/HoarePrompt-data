Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the first character of `password`, `ch` is not a digit, and `letters` is a list containing the character `ch`.**

Explanation: The code appends the first character of the string `password` to the list `letters`. Since `ch` is the first character of `password` and is not a digit, it is added to the list `letters`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
