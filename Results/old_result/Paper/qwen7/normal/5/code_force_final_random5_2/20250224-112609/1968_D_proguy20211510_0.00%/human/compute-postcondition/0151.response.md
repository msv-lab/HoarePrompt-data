Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value of `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value of `ptsb`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `ptsb` contains the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` contains the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`, `n` is the first part of the input split by space, `k` is the second part of the input split by space, `pb` is the third part of the input split by space, `ps` is the fourth part of the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string by spaces and assigns the parts to `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. The values of `maxs`, `maxb`, `i`, `rem`, `ptsb`, and `ptss` remain unchanged from their initial states.
