Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze how it processes the input and generates the output according to the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Calculation Process**:
   - It initializes `s` to 0 and `m` to 1.
   - It enters a loop where `n` is repeatedly halved (`n //= 2`), and `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - The cumulative sum `s` is updated by adding `x` to it.
   - If `k` falls within the current range `[s, s + x]`, the loop breaks.
   - After exiting the loop, the program calculates the result using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

3. **Formula Explanation**:
   - The formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` aims to find the k-th card based on the pattern described in the problem. Here, `m` represents the multiplier (1, 2, 4, 8, ...), and `k - s` gives the position within the current group of cards.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic of halving `n` and updating `s` ensures that the program correctly identifies the group of cards that the k-th card belongs to.
   - The formula used to compute the k-th card in the identified group is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic and formula to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav.

Correctness: **True**
