Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly address the problem statement. Here’s why:

1. **Handling `k` Values**: The current implementation only handles cases where `k >= 2`. However, the problem specifies that `1 <= k <= n`, so the code needs to handle cases where `k = 1` and `k = 1` is the only sorted cyclic shift.

2. **Case When `k = 1`**: For `k = 1`, the array should have exactly one sorted cyclic shift. The provided solution incorrectly prints `-1` for these cases. Instead, it should generate an array where exactly one cyclic shift is sorted.

3. **General Case**: The solution also fails to handle the general case where `1 < k < n` correctly. It only checks for `n == k` and prints a sequence of `k` repeated values, which does not guarantee that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to ensure that the array has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. One way to achieve this is by creating an array with a specific pattern. Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k == n:
            # If k == n, we can simply repeat the value n times.
            print(*[1 for _ in range(n)])
        elif k == 1:
            # If k == 1, we need to create an array where only one cyclic shift is sorted.
            print(*range(1, n))
        else:
            # For other cases, we need to construct an array with exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.
            arr = [0] * n
            arr[0] = 1
            for i in range(1, k):
                arr[i] = n - i
            for i in range(k, n):
                arr[i] = i - k + 1
            print(*arr)
```

This solution ensures that the array meets the criteria for having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
