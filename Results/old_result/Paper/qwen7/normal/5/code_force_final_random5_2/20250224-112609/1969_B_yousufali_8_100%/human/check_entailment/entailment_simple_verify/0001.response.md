### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. A cyclic shift operation on a substring of length `r-l+1` has a cost of `r-l+1`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1()`**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It iterates through the string and counts the number of consecutive '1's (`n`).
   - When it encounters a '0' after at least one '1' has been encountered (`n != 0`), it adds `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`). This suggests that it is counting the cost of shifting all '1's to the end of the string.
   - Finally, it prints the accumulated cost.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the string using cyclic shifts. It assumes that moving all '1's to the end of the string is the optimal solution, which is not always true.
   - For example, consider the string "101011". The correct solution involves multiple shifts to move '1's to their correct positions, but the current logic would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5 instead of 9.
   - The annotated code provides detailed explanations that confirm the logic is flawed. Specifically, it states that `ans` is the sum of the lengths of all blocks of '0's plus one for each block, which is not the correct approach.

4. **Analyzing `func_2()`**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - This part of the code is correct and handles multiple test cases as required.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` is flawed because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the string using cyclic shifts.
   - Therefore, the overall program will produce incorrect results for most test cases.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic in `func_1()` is flawed and does not provide the correct minimum cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
