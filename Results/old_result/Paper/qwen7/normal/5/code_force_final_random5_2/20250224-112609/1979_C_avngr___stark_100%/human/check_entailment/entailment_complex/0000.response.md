Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This requires finding a distribution that satisfies the condition for each test case.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k_i`).
   - It calls `func_2(k)` to get a value `m`.
   - It then calculates `c` as a list of `m // k[i]` for each outcome.
   - If the sum of `c` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values in `c`.

3. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - Given the constraints (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 20), the gcd will be at most 20, and the result will be an integer between 1 and 20.

4. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - `func_2(numbers)` applies `func_1` successively to the elements of `numbers`.
   - Since `func_1` returns a value between 1 and 20, and `numbers` contains integers between 2 and 20, the result of `func_2` will also be between 1 and 20.

5. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in the main loop correctly checks if the sum of the bets is less than the value returned by `func_2`.
   - If the sum is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints `-1`, which is correct because the condition cannot be satisfied.
   - If the sum is less than `m`, it prints the calculated bets, which should satisfy the condition.

Given the above analysis, the code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
