Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are assigned as per the input, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` is not equal to `x4` or `x3` is not equal to `x2`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`.
