Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()); `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()); `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in place, meaning the elements within `a` are rearranged into a non-decreasing order. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `m`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
