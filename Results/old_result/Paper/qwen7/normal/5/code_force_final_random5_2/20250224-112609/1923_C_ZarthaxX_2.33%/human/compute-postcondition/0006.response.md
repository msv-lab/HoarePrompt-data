Output State: **`ones[i]` is updated to `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`, `sum[i]` is updated to `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`**.

This means that the value of `ones[i]` is now the value of `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise it remains the same as `ones[i - 1]`. Similarly, the value of `sum[i]` is now the value of `sum[i - 1]` plus `nums[i - 1]` minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
