Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions for being strong. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each password according to the rules, and outputs whether each password is strong or not. The `func_1` function checks if the password has no digit after a letter, and if all digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. The overall structure and logic of the program align with the problem description and the example provided.
