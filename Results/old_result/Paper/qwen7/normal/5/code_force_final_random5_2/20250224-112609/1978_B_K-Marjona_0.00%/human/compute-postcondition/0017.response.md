Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, and `k` is the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. It also calculates `k` as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
