Output State: **`m` is `n-2`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l1`, `l2`, `l22`, `l3`, `val`, and `t` retain their states from the last iteration of the loop.**

This means that after the loop has executed `n-2` times (since the loop continues until `m` is no longer greater than 2), the variable `m` is set to `n-2`. The variables `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l1`, `l2`, `l22`, `l3`, `val`, and `t` remain in the state they were in after the last iteration of the loop, as no new assignments are made within the loop body.
