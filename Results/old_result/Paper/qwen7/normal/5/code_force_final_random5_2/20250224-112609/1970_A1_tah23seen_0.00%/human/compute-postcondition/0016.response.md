Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(s))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is that `s` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`. This means that after each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `s` is a string.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 2`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `s` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` is now `i + 2`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i + 2`**
