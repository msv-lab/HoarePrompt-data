Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `w[j]` is incremented by 1 in `q`**.

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Since `j` is 0, it means `w[0]` is being accessed and its corresponding value in dictionary `q` is incremented. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.
