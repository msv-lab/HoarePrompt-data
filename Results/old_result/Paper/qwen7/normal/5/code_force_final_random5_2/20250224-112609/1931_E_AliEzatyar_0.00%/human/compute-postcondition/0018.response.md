Output State: The value of `counter` will be equal to the number of consecutive '0's from the end of the list `num`. If there are no '0's at all, `counter` will be 0.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `counter` will hold the count of consecutive '0's starting from the last element of the list `num` and moving backwards until a non-'0' element is encountered or the entire list is traversed.
