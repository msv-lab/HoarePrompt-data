Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state.
