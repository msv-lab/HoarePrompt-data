Output State: **`success` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `time_available` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `bullets_needed` is `monsters[i][1]`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + monsters[n][1] + monsters[i][1]`**

Explanation: The line `bullets_needed = health` updates the value of `bullets_needed` to be equal to `health`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
