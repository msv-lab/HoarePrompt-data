Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(n\). For each \(x\), it finds the largest divisor that is less than or equal to \(k = x // n\). If no such divisor exists, it considers the smallest prime factor of \(x\). The function outputs the maximum of these values found across all test cases.**
