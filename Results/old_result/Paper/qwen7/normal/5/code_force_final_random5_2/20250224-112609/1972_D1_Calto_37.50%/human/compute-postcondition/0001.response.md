Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, m):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined within the loop head.
   - `m` is defined as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, m)` will execute as long as `m > 1`.
   - If `m` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is not defined in the loop head, its initial value does not affect the loop's execution.
   - We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `m` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` must be greater than 1**
