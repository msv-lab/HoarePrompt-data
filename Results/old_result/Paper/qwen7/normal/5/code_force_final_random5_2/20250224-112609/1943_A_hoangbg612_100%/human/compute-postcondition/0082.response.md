Output State: **`N` is not empty, `cur` is the second element of `N`, `M[cur]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Initially, `cur` was set to the first element of `N`. After executing `cur += 1`, `cur` now points to the second element of `N`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
