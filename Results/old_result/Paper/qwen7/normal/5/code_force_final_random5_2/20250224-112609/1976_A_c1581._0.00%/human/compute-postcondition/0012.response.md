Output State: **`char` is the next character in the `password` string, `password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, if the first character of `password` was a digit, `digits` is a list containing that digit, otherwise `letters` is a list with one additional element being that letter; `letters` now contains one additional element which is `char`.**

Explanation: The code appends the `char` to the `letters` list. The initial conditions regarding the `password`, `digits`, and `letters` lists remain unchanged except that `letters` now includes the new `char`.
