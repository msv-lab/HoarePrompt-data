Output State: **`_` is the current value of the loop counter plus 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `n`. The variable `_` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `_` is still the current value of the loop counter plus 1, and `n` is now an integer input from the user.
