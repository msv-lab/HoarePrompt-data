Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `ans` + `pre[5][0] * suf[5][0] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`. If `prefix[1]` shifted right by `j` and bitwise AND with 1 is true, then `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1 for `j`=5. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1 for `j`=0.
