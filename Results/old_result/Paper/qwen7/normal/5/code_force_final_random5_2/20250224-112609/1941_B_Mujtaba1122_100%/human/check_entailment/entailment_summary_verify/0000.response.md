### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summaries to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise. This function is correct and works as expected.

#### Function `func_2`:
The function `func_2` processes the list by repeatedly modifying the values based on the specified conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what `func_2` does:

1. **Iterate through the list**: The function iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2` (since we need to check both `i-1` and `i+1`).
2. **Check conditions and modify values**: For each index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`), the function checks if `list[i] > 1` and `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`. If these conditions are met, it performs the specified operations:
   - `list[i+1] -= list[i-1]`
   - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
   - `list[i-1] -= list[i-1]`
3. **Check intermediate results**: After processing, the function calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The function summary states that after processing, the list will have all elements either 0 or negative, and the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` will all be exactly 0. This aligns with the problem description and the operations defined.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- **Handling of operations**: The function correctly applies the operations only when the conditions are met, ensuring that the operations are valid.
- **Edge cases**: The function handles the edge cases where the list might not be reducible to all zeros. If any element remains non-zero after processing, the function correctly identifies this and prints 'NO'.
- **Final check**: The function uses `func_1` to verify if all elements are zero, which is a correct approach.

Given the analysis, the function `func_2` correctly implements the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. The original assessment was overly critical and did not fully consider the correctness of the function's implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the function summaries.
