Output State: **`m` is `n`, `a3` is the last integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is an empty list, `val` is an empty list, and `t` is 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
