Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3; `x` is the remainder of `a[i]` divided by 10; `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)`, `n` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1` depending on the value of `i` and whether `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`; `c` is appended with `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `c`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 2 or 3, `x` is still the remainder of `a[i]` divided by 10, `y` is still `int(a[i] / 10)`, and `n` is still either `n + 2` or `n + 1` depending on the conditions specified. The list `c` now includes the value of `a[i]`.
