Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`ntest`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array elements (`a`).

2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is crucial because the maximum beauty is achieved when the largest values are paired with the smallest values from opposite ends of the sorted array.

3. **Calculating Beauty**: The program iterates through the first half of the sorted array and calculates the sum of differences between each element from the start and the corresponding element from the end of the array. This ensures that the largest values are subtracted from the smallest values, maximizing the sum.

4. **Output**: The result is printed for each test case, which is the correct output format.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is accurate and will produce the correct results for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
