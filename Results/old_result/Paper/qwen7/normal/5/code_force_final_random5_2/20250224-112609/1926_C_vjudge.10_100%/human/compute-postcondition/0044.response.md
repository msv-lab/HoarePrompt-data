The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 200,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is 199,999**
