Output State: The `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the list `nums` as keys, with their respective counts as values after all iterations of the loop. The `res` variable will be updated to include the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, and the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`. The `nums` list will be empty after all iterations of the loop have completed.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will hold the frequency count of each number in the original `nums` list. The `res` variable will be calculated based on combinations of these counts according to the given formulas, and the `nums` list will be exhausted (i.e., empty).
