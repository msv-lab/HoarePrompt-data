Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and `nums` now contains an additional element which is `k + 1`, and `nums` is updated to include `k + (k - 2^{23}) + 1`.**

In natural language: `idx` remains 23, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains at least 16777216, `nums` originally contained integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and now `nums` includes an additional element `k + 1`. After appending, `nums` now also contains `k + (k - 2^{23}) + 1`.
