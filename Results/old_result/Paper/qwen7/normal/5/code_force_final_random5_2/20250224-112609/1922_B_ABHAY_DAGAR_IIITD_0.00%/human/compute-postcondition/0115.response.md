Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `x` as it iterates over `num_list`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `x` and `num_list`**: 
   - `x` is the variable being iterated over.
   - `num_list` is the list that `x` is iterating through.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: 
   - For the loop to execute, `num_list` must contain at least one element. If `num_list` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `num_list` is initially empty (`num_list` remains an empty list), the loop will not execute unless `num_list` contains at least one element.
   - The initial values of other variables (`num_of_lens`, `res`, `total_count`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given information.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num_list` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final State:**
State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all calculated values from the loop, `num_of_lens` is the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_list` must contain at least one element, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is an input integer.**
