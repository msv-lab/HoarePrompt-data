You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b, where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, and k is the minimum value between n and b - a. After all iterations of the loop, if b > a, then k remains unchanged from its initial value. If b ≤ a, then k remains unchanged from its initial value as well. The final output will be calculated based on the values of n, a, b, and k for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: the number of buns (n), the usual price of a bun (a), and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). It calculates the total cost of buying n buns under the given pricing conditions and prints the result for each test case. If the modified price (b) is less than or equal to the usual price (a), it calculates the total cost based on the usual price. Otherwise, it calculates the total cost considering both the usual and modified prices for the respective buns.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the value of `k` is incorrect. The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`, which does not always yield the optimal result.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
- Expected Output: `35` (optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the modified price)

However, the program calculates:
- `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
- The profit calculation becomes `(9 + (9 - 4 + 1)) // 2 * 4 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 15 * 4 + 5 = 65`

This is incorrect because the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the modified price, yielding a profit of `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
