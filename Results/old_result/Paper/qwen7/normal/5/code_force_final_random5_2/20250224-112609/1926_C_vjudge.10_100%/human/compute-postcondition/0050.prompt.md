You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be 200001, `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of the digits of `i-1`, and `values[200001]` will be the cumulative sum of `sum_value_digits` for all integers from 1 to 200000.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, and `value` will be an input integer that has never been used within the loop during its execution. The variable `sum_value_digits` will hold the sum of the digits of `200000 - 1`, which is 18 (since 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 + ... + 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 = 18), and `values[200001]` will be the cumulative sum of `sum_value_digits` for all integers from 1 to 200000, which is 18 * 200000 / 2 = 1,800,000.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
