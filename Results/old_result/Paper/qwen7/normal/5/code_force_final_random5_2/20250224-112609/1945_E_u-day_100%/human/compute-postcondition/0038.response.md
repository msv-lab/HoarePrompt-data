Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2`, `mid`, and `mid`.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Since `mid` was already in the set, adding it again does not change the set's contents. Therefore, the set `st` now contains `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid` twice, which simplifies to just the two distinct values. All other variables remain unchanged.
