Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num_tests \leq 100\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()); `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()).**

Explanation: The code reads a new list of integers `c` from the input, which is split by spaces and then converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list `c` is then assigned to the variable `c`. All other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `m`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
