Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` must be at least 1, and `leftZero` is 1, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Initially, `leftZero` is assumed to be 0 (since no specific value is given, we take the default). After executing the code, `leftZero` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
