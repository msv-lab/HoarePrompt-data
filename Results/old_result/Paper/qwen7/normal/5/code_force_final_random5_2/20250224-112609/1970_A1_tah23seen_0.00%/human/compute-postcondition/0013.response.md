Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`, and `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d[i + 1]` to `d[i] - 1`. Initially, `d[i + 1]` was either `d[i] + 1` or `d[i] - 1`. After the code executes, `d[i + 1]` is now specifically `d[i] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
