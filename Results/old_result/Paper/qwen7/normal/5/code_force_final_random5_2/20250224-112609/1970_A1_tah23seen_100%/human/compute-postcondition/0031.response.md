Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(i, j)` in the for loop. This means the variables `i` and `j` are the ones that will change during each iteration.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more tuples in the list `d`. Since `d` is a sorted list of tuples, the loop will continue until all tuples have been processed.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `d` is a sorted list of tuples from the original dictionary `d` based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order, with the last element of the tuple negated.
   - `i` is the first element of the next tuple in `d`.
   - `j` is the second element of the next tuple in `d`.
   - `ans` is `ans` plus the value of `s[i]`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - After processing the current tuple `(i, j)`, the next tuple in `d` will be accessed. Therefore, `i` will become the first element of the next tuple, and `j` will become the second element of the next tuple.
   - Since `d` is sorted, the next tuple will have the smallest second element among the remaining tuples in `d`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `d` remains the same because it is an external list that does not change within the loop.
   - `i` becomes the first element of the next tuple in `d`.
   - `j` becomes the second element of the next tuple in `d`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`d` is a sorted list of tuples from the original dictionary `d` based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order, with the last element of the tuple negated, and must contain at least one tuple; `i` is the first element of the next tuple in `d`, `j` is the second element of the next tuple in `d`**.
