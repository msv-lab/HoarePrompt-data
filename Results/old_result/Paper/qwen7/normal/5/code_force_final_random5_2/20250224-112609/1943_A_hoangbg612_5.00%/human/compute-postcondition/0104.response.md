Postcondition: `cur` is `-1` or the current value of `num`, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `num` is the next element in `N`, and `M[cur]` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`. If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. If `num <= cur`, then `cur` remains unchanged and `M[cur]` is set to 2.
