Reasoning:

The annotated program does not match the problem statement and the expected behavior. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program should read `t` (the number of test cases) and then for each test case, it should read `n` and `m`. However, the provided code reads `t` but does not process it correctly. It calls `func_1()` `t` times without using the value of `t`.

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: 
   - The function `func_1` correctly processes the values of `n` and `m` for a single test case.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.
   - However, the state after processing each test case is not maintained across different test cases because the function is called `t` times independently.

To fix this, the main loop should iterate `t` times, reading `n` and `m` for each iteration and calling `func_1` with these values. 

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
for _ in range(t):  # Iterate for each test case
    n, m = map(int, input().split())  # Read n and m for the current test case
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
