Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are reassigned, their previous values remain unchanged.
