Reasoning:
1. The provided function only checks for a specific pattern (`l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`) within each test case and prints `2` if this pattern is found. If the pattern is not found, it prints `3`.
2. This approach is incomplete and incorrect for several reasons:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party. The function does not consider all possible pairs of friends that could be invited to satisfy this condition.
   - The function assumes that if the pattern `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` exists, exactly 2 friends will come. However, the problem allows for more complex scenarios where multiple pairs might need to be considered.
   - The function does not handle cases where no such pair exists, which should result in a different output according to the problem statement.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
