Output State: **`index` is 1, `T` is an integer from the list `data`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(data[index])` takes the string at the current index of the list `data` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `T`. Since `index` was initially 0, after executing the code, `index` is incremented to 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` also remains unchanged.
