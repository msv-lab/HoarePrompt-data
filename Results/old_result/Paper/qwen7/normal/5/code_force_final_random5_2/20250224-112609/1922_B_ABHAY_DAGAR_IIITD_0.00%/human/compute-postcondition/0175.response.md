Functionality: **The function processes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer \( n \) (representing the number of sticks) followed by \( n \) integers (exponents). For each tuple, it calculates a sum based on the frequency of each exponent and stores the result in a list. Finally, it prints each result from the list.**
