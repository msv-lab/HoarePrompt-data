Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process**: The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with all distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order. Then, each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**: The provided program aims to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`. To do this, it needs to reverse the mapping used during encoding. Specifically, it should create a mapping from each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in the original `r`.

3. **Analysis of `func_1` Function**:
   - The function correctly creates a `char_map` that maps each unique character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in the original `r`. This is done by sorting the unique characters in `b` and mapping them to characters from `'a'` to `'z'` in reverse order.
   - The mapping logic ensures that the last character in the sorted unique list of `b` maps to `'a'`, the second last maps to `'b'`, and so on.
   - After creating the `char_map`, the function constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding value in `char_map`.

4. **Edge Cases and Guarantees**:
   - The function handles all characters in `b` correctly by ensuring that each unique character is mapped to a unique character in the alphabet.
   - The guarantees provided in the problem statement ensure that the input `b` is a valid encoded string, meaning it can always be decoded back to a valid string `s`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly decodes the string `b` back to the original string `s` as per the given encoding algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
