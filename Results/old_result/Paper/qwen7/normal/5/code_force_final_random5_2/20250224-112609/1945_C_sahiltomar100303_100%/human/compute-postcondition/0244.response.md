Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - 2` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than `(mid - 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is increased by 1, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2`, and at least one of `leftZero < (mid - 1 + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - mid + 1 + 1) // 2` must hold true.**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `rightZero` being increased by 1 while maintaining the other conditions and constraints specified in the initial state.
