Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N:`. The variables involved here are `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `num` is a variable that will take on values from the list `N` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `N`. Once `N` is exhausted (i.e., becomes empty), the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `num` is a variable that changes with each iteration, we don't need to specify its initial value. We just need to ensure that `N` is not empty for the loop to start.
   - `N` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `N`. Specifically, `N` must be a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order**
