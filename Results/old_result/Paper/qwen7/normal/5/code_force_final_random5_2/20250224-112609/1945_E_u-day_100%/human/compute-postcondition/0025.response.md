Postcondition: `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the value `(0 + n) // 2`. Additionally, `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.
