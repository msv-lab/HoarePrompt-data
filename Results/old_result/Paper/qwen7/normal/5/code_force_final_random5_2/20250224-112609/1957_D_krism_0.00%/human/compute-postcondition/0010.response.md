Output State: `prefix` is a list containing `[0, v1 ^ 0, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ (v2 ^ v3), ..., vn-1 ^ (vn-2 ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1 ^ 0)...) ]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, where `v1, v2, ..., vn` are the elements of `arr`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `prefix` list will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` starting from 0, where each subsequent element in `prefix` is the result of XORing the current element in `arr` with the previous element in `prefix`. The `arr` list remains unchanged, and `t` and `n` retain their initial values.
