Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, and both `founds` and `foundb` are `True`**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `b` the value of `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `(i + 1)` is 1. Therefore, the value appended to `b` is `(k - 1) * maxa`. The other variables remain unchanged.
