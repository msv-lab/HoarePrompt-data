Postcondition: `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`, and if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 3; otherwise, `i` remains 2 and `j` remains 2.
