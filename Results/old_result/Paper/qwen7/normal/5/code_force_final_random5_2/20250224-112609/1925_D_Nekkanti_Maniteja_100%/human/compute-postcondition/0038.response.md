Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `m` is `k`, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is `a` plus `f`, `u` is updated to an integer from input, `v` is updated to an integer from input, `f` is updated to an integer from input**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The initial values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged. The variable `a` is updated to `a + f`. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated to the integers entered by the user.
