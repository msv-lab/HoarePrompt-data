Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 3 * n + 2`, `n` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index - 1:index + n + 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `t` is `t - 2`, `arr` is updated to be `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`**

Explanation: The code updates the list `arr` by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers using `map(int, ...)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
