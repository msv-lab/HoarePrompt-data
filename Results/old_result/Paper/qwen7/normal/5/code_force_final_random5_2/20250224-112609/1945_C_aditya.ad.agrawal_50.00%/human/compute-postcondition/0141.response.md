Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `pos` is increased by 1 to o_l + 1; `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `o_l += 1` increments the value of `o_l` by 1. Since `pos` was previously increased by 1, it is now equivalent to `o_l + 1`. The other conditions remain unchanged: `arr` must have at least one element, and `i` is not equal to 0.
