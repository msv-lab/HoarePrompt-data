Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to 0 (since `range(t)` generates values from 0 to `t-1`).

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < t`. Therefore, `t` must be a positive integer.

4. **Initial Values of `a` and `b`**: The initial values of `a` and `b` do not affect the loop's execution directly. They are not used in the loop head or the condition for the loop to continue.

5. **Initial Value of `t`**: Since the loop depends on `t`, `t` must be a positive integer. Given that `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

Based on these steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be initialized to 0.
- `t` must be a positive integer (since `t` is an input integer, we assume it is valid and within the given constraints).

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `i` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer**
