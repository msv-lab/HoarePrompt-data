Output State: **`right` equals `n + 1`, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `left` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `s` is an input string, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `leftZero = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftZero`. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `right`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `left`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `s`, `n`, and `mid` remain unchanged.
