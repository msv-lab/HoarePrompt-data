Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either a lowercase character where it does not match `c[i]` causing a break, or it is not a lowercase character where the function checks if the character at the same index in `c` (when converted to lowercase) matches the character in `template`, causing a break if they match or remaining unchanged if they do not.
