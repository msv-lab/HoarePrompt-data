Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.
   - It first extracts the unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - Then it creates a dictionary (`char_map`) that maps each unique character to its corresponding character in the reverse order of the sorted unique characters.
   - Finally, it decodes the encoded string by replacing each character according to the mappings in `char_map`.

2. **Input Handling**: The main part of the program reads input correctly and processes each test case separately.
   - It reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into parts.
   - It iterates over each test case, extracts the necessary information, and calls `func_1` to get the decoded string.
   - The decoded strings are collected in a list and printed out.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases as specified in the problem description:
   - It can handle multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It ensures that the length constraints are respected (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5).

4. **Correctness**: Given the logic implemented in both the main program and the function, and considering the problem constraints, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
