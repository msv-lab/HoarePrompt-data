Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and m are integers obtained from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 100.
