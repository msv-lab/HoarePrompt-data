### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy \( n \) yogurts.
- For every two yogurts, you can pay \( b \) burles instead of \( 2a \) burles.
- The program should process multiple test cases, each defined by \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
- It calculates either \( a \times b \) or \( \text{round}(a \times c/2) \) based on the comparison between \( a \times b \) and \( a \times c/2 \), where \( c \) is another integer input.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Promotion Cost**:
   - The program calculates `d = c / 2` and uses this to compare with `a * b`.
   - This calculation is incorrect because `c` should represent the price for two yogurts, not an intermediate value.
   - The correct approach is to directly use `b` for the promotion price and compare it with the regular price `a`.

2. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program should determine how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and then handle the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - Calculate the number of full pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price: `pairs = n // 2`.
     - Calculate the remaining single yogurts: `remaining = n % 2`.
     - Total cost = `pairs * b + remaining * a`.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `3 5 11`:
     - Correct approach: Buy one yogurt at 5 burles and the other two at 11 burles each.
     - Total cost = `5 + 11 + 11 = 27`.
     - The program incorrectly prints `15`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
