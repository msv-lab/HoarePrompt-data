Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is halved from its current value and is now an integer obtained by dividing the original `n` by 2, `k` is the input integer, `s` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration, `m` is 8, and `x` for the next iteration is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.

This means that `n` has been updated to its half value, while `t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and the formula for calculating `x` for the next iteration remain unchanged from their initial states.
