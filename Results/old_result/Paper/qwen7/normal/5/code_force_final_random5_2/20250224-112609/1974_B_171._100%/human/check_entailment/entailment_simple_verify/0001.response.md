### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes the index to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it correctly reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then processes the encoded string `b` to decode it using the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an encoded string `b` as input.
   - It first finds all unique characters in `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `unique_chars`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character.
   - Finally, it decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its mapped value from `char_map`.

4. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The logic to create the `char_map` is correct. It maps each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.
   - The decoding process using the `char_map` also appears to be correct. However, there is a critical flaw in the decoding logic.

   Specifically, the issue lies in the way the `char_map` is constructed. The current implementation assumes that the `char_map` should map each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters. However, this approach does not account for the fact that the original string `s` might have repeated characters, and these characters need to be handled correctly during decoding.

   For example, consider the encoded string `"serofedsoc"`. The unique characters are `"cdefors"`, and the symmetric mapping would be:
   - `c -> c`
   - `d -> d`
   - `e -> e`
   - `f -> f`
   - `o -> o`
   - `r -> r`
   - `s -> s`

   However, the original string `"codeforces"` contains multiple occurrences of `'o'`, `'c'`, and `'s'`. The current implementation would incorrectly handle these repeated characters, leading to an incorrect decoded string.

5. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are stored in the `results` list and printed out one by one. Given the flaw in the decoding logic, the output will not be correct for strings with repeated characters.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment concluded that the program is correct, but this conclusion is inaccurate due to the flaw in the decoding logic when handling repeated characters.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
