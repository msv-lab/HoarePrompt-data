Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `curr` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `last` is the last element of the list `nums`.
Code of the loop:
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `curr` is `i - last`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string that must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of the list `nums`, `i` is the first element of `nums`, and the current value of `i` is not 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `curr` is `2 * (i - last)`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of the list `nums`, `i` is the second element of the list `nums` (if `nums` still has elements), `nums` is the list without its first element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `curr` is `3 * (i - last)`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `last` is the second-to-last element of the updated `nums`, `i` is the third element of the updated `nums`, `nums` is the list without its first two elements, and this holds true if `i` is not equal to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
