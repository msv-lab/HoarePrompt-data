Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99989999, `ans` is a list containing either 99999999 or -100000000, and `t` is 1. If `x` is divisible by 2, `x` is halved, `max` is decremented by 1, and `ans` contains 99999999. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged, `min` is decremented by 1, and `ans` contains -100000000.
