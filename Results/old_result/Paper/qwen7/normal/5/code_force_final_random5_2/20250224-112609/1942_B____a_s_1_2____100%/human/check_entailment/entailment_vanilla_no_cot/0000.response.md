Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains a logical error. Specifically, the approach to calculating `mex` and assigning values to `p` is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`:** The code initializes `mex` to `n` and then tries to update it within the loop. However, this approach doesn't correctly capture the `mex` value for the current position in the permutation. The `mex` should be determined based on the values already assigned to `p`.

2. **Reversing the Loop:** The loop runs in reverse order (`range(n - 1, -1, -1)`), which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results because the `mex` calculation depends on the values already placed in `p`.

3. **Updating `mex` Incorrectly:** The `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value being assigned to `p[i]`. This logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly reflect the `mex` value for the current position.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        
        # Initialize used set with values from a
        for i in range(n):
            used.add(a[i])
        
        # Fill the permutation p
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex
            used.add(p[i])
        
        print(*p)
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- We use a set `used` to keep track of the values that have been used.
- We correctly calculate the `mex` for each position in the permutation.
- We ensure that each value in `p` is unique and follows the given constraints.
