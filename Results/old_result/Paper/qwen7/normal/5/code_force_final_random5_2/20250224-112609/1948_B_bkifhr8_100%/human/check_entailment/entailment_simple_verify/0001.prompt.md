You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with the following characteristics:
    #
    #- `i` is 0, as the loop decremented `i` from `m - 1` to 0.
    #- `m` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
    #- `arr` is updated such that for every pair of consecutive elements where the second element is less than the first, the first element has been updated to match the smallest value in the sequence formed by concatenating and sorting the digits of the two elements.
    #- `ans` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the loop's condition was met throughout all iterations. If `ans` is `True`, it means that for every pair of consecutive elements where the second element is less than the first, the first element has been successfully updated to match the smallest value in the sequence formed by concatenating and sorting the digits of the two elements. If `ans` is `False`, it means that at some point during the loop's execution, the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` was found to be true, and `ans` was set to `False`, breaking the loop.
    #
    #The final state of `arr` and `ans` will reflect the outcome of the loop's execution based on the input provided.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `m` and the array itself.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted initially.
   
3. **Checking Array Order:**
   - It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (`m - 1` to `0`).
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`.

4. **Digit Splitting and Sorting Check:**
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, it splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted.
   - If the list of digits is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, otherwise it prints "YES".

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Digit Splitting and Sorting Check:**
   - The logic for checking if the digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]` can be sorted is flawed.
   - The program only checks if the combined list of digits is sorted but does not ensure that the resulting array can be sorted after splitting and reinserting the digits.

2. **Assumption of Splitting and Reinsertion:**
   - The program assumes that splitting and reinserting the digits will always result in a sorted array, which is not necessarily true. For example, consider the array `[12, 34, 56]`. Splitting `12` and `34` and reinserting them might not result in a sorted array.

3. **No Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array cannot be sorted even after splitting and reinserting digits.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
