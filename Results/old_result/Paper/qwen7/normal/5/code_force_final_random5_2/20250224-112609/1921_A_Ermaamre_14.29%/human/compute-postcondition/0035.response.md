Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space, and `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`. Additionally, `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`; `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `res`. Since `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `res` will be `y1 - y2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
