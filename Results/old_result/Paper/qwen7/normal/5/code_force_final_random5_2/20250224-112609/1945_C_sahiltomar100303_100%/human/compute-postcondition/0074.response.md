Postcondition: `s` is a string, `left` is an integer, and `rightZero` and `rightOne` are updated based on the character at position `left - 1`. If the character is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1. If the character is not '0', then `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.
