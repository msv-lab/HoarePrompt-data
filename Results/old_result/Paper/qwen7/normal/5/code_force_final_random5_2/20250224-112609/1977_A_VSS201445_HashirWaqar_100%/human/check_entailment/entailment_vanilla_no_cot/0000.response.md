Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `n` (the total number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes).
2. **Parity Check**: It then checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This ensures that the number of additions and removals can balance out to achieve exactly `m` cubes.

- If both conditions are met, it prints "YES".
- Otherwise, it prints "NO".

This logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
