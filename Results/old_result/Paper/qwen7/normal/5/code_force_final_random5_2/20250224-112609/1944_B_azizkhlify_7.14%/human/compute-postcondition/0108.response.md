Output State: **`r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `ur` is equal to `ur` + 4, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` remains the same.**

Explanation: The line `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since `ur` was initially equal to `ur` + 2, after this operation, `ur` becomes `ur` + 4. All other variables (`r[a[i] - 1]`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
