You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range [0, 9]. For each test case, it prints one of three strings: "STAIR" if \(a < b < c\), "PEAK" if \(b\) is the maximum value among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), and "NONE" otherwise. After processing all test cases, it outputs nothing and ends.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met. This part is correct.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a == b == c` and prints 'NONE' if this condition is met. However, this check should be done after checking the stair condition, as a sequence that is both equal can't be a stair or a peak.
5. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `max(a, b, c) == b`. This is a correct way to check for the peak condition, but it needs to be placed after the stair condition check.
6. **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'NONE'. This is correct.

However, there is an issue with the order of the checks. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles sequences where all three numbers are equal (`a == b == c`). When `a == b == c`, the program should print 'NONE', but it incorrectly prints 'PEAK' because the peak condition check is evaluated before the equality check.

### Corrected Version:
To fix this, we need to ensure that the equality check is done last. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in the order of conditions. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
