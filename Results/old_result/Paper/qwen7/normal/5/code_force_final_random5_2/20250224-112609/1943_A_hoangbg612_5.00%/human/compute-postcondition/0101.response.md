Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The values of `_`, `S`, `N`, and the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement remain unchanged from the initial state.
