Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the integer input by the user, `m` is the integer input by the user in the previous iteration. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, then no change is made to `t`. Otherwise, no change is made to `t`.
