Output State: `coord` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (x, y) from the input, the second tuple is also (x, y), and the third tuple is (x, y); `i` is 3; `x` is updated to the first integer from the input split; `y` is updated to the second integer from the input split.

In this final state after all iterations of the loop, `coord` will contain three tuples as specified in the third iteration's output state, because the loop continues to append the same (x, y) pair three times. The variable `i` will be 3 since the loop runs in a range from 0 to 3 (inclusive). The values of `x` and `y` will be the integers from the input split in the third iteration, as they are updated each time through the loop.
