Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `2 * n`, `k` is an input integer, `ul` is 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `l` is a list of `n` zeros where each element at index `a[i] - 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1` has been incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `l` will contain the count of how many times each index (from 0 to `n-1`) appears in the list `a`. Each element in `l` corresponds to an index in `a`, and the value at each index in `l` represents the frequency of that index in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is within the range [n, 2 * n - 1], `k` is an input integer, `ul` is 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `l` is a list of `n` zeros where each element at index `a[i] - 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1` has been incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros where the element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is within the range `[n, 2 * n - 2]`, `k` is an input integer, `ul` is 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `l` is a list of `n` zeros where each element at index `a[i] - 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1` has been incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros where the element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 (one more time), `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is within the range `(n, 2 * n - 1]`, `k` is an input integer, `ul` is 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `l` is a list of `n` zeros where each element at index `a[i] - 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1` has been incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros where the element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 2, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
