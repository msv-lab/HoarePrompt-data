Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the second element of `arr`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `num` is the second element of `arr`, the next element in `arr` will be accessed in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `num` will be set to the third element of `arr` in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `arr` remains the same list of integers, but now `num` is the third element of `arr`.
   - `frequency_table` remains unchanged unless the new `num` (which is the third element of `arr`) meets the condition to increment its count.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers starting from the third element, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `frequency_table` is a dictionary**.
