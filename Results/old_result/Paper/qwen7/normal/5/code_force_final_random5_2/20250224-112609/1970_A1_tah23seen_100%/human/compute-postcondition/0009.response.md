Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0, and `d[1]` is -1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1` updates the value of `d[i + 1]` (which is `d[1]` since `i` is 0) to be the value of `d[i]` (which is initially 0) minus 1. Therefore, `d[1]` becomes -1. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
