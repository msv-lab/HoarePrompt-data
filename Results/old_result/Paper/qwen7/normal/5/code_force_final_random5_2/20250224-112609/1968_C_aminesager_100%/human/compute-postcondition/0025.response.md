Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n-2`
- `a` is updated such that its last element is now equal to `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2`.
2. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `n-1`.

### Adjusting the State
- The variable `i` needs to be adjusted to `n-1`.
- The variable `a` does not change based on the loop head alone; it is updated inside the loop body. Since we are only asked to adjust the state based on the loop head, we do not need to modify `a`.

### Updated State
State: **`i` is `n-1`**

So, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`i` is `n-1`**
