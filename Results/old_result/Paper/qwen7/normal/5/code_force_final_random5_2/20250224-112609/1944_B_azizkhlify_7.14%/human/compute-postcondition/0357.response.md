Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`.
   - The variable `i` is being updated in each iteration of the loop.
   - The variable `n` is a constant defined before the loop.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `res` must contain elements.
   - `ul` is equal to `ur`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming no other changes to `i` within the loop body).
   - Therefore, `i` will become `n + 1`.
   - The condition `i < 2 * n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Check the loop continuation condition**:
   - If `n` is 1, then `2 * n` is 2. So, `i` needs to be less than 2.
   - If `n` is 2, then `2 * n` is 4. So, `i` needs to be less than 4.
   - Generally, `i` needs to be less than `2 * n` for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `res` must contain elements.
- `ul` is equal to `ur`.
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `res` must contain elements, `ul` is equal to `ur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
