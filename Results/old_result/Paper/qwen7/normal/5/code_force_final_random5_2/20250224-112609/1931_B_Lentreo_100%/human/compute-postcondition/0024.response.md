Postcondition: `total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is `nums[1] - mean + nums[2] - mean + nums[4] - mean`, `i` is 4, if `curr` is less than 0, the function returns 'NO', otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables.
