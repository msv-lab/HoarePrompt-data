Postcondition: `last_digit_index` is either 1 if the first character of `password` is a digit, or -1 if it is not. `i` is 2 if the first character is a digit, and 1 if it is not. `char` is the second character of `password` if the first character is not a digit, and the first character itself if it is a digit.
