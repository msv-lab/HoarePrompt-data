Output State: **`match_c` is True, `i` is 3, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `template` is an empty list**.

The code initializes an empty list named `template`. This does not affect the values of `match_c`, `i`, `a`, or `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
