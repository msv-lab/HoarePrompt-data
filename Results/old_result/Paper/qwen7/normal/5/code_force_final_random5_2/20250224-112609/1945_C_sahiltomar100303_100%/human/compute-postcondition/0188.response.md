Output State: **`i` is 1 if it was 0, or 0 if it was 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 5**.

Explanation: The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Given that `leftZero` was initially 4 (based on the initial state), after executing the code, `leftZero` becomes 5. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
