### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`).
   - The array length should be at most 200.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence based on the input number.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.
   - The key logic in `func_1` involves binary representation and manipulation to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Binary Representation Insight:**
   - The function uses binary representation to determine the sequence. Specifically, it uses the formula `(1 << size + 1) - 1` to check the number of possible increasing subsequences.
   - The function iteratively builds the sequence and adjusts values to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The function correctly handles the base case when `number == 0`.
   - It uses a loop to build the sequence and recursively adjust values to match the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The assertions in the code help ensure the sequence is built correctly.

5. **Output Handling:**
   - The main loop reads the test cases and calls `func_1` to generate the sequence.
   - The sequence is printed with the appropriate length and values.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For small values of `X`, the function should produce valid sequences.
   - For larger values, the function should still produce valid sequences as long as the binary representation logic holds.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided implementation seems to correctly generate the required sequence for the given problem constraints. The function `func_1` handles the generation of the sequence based on the binary representation and ensures the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
