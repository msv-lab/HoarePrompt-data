Output State: **`h1` is '01', `m1` is equal to the string `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is equal to '01'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'01'` to the variable `h1`. The values of `m1`, `time`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `m1` is still equal to the string `m`, `time` is still an empty string, and `h` is still equal to `'01'`.
