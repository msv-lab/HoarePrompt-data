Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of n characters consisting only of '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is always '.', indicating that the path starts with an empty cell.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn == 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input, `ret` is the total count of '@' characters in the list `s`, `thorn` is the total count of '*' characters in the list `s` that did not cause an immediate break, and the program breaks out of the loop if two consecutive '*' characters are found.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `ret` is the total count of '@' characters encountered in the list `s`, `thorn` is the cumulative count of '*' characters encountered without encountering another '*', and `s` is the list of characters after processing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All characters in the list `s` have been processed, `ret` is the total count of '@' characters in `s`, and `thorn` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
