Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list starting with 1000 followed by the cumulative sum of `T` up to `n-2`, `result` is "1000", `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `line` is the user-inputted string converted to a list of integers.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1`. The list `a` will start with 1000 and each subsequent element will be the cumulative sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `T` (i.e., `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]` for each iteration). The variable `result` remains unchanged as "1000". The variable `t` decreases by 1 for each iteration, and `n` must initially be greater than 1. The variable `line` remains as the user-inputted string converted to a list of integers.
