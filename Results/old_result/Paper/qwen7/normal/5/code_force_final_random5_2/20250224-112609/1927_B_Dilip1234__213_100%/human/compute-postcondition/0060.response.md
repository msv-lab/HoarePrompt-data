Output State: **`i` is 26, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 26, `s` is equal to 'abz', `char_count[3]` is 1.**

The code increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, `char_count[3]` is incremented by 1, making its value 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
