Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 1, `o_r` is -1, `z_r` is 1, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - (ans + 1))`, `o_l` is equal to its original value plus 1, and the condition `(o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - (ans + 1))))` is true.**

Explanation: The value of `o_r` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The condition mentioned in the initial state remains valid as no changes were made to the variables involved in the condition.
