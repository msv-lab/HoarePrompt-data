Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The only variable mentioned in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` is 2
   - `b[1]` is 2

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `x` and `b[1]` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `x` remains 2
- `b[1]` remains 2

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `x` is 2, `b[1]` is 2**
