Output State: **`M` is a list of integers, `i` is within the bounds of `M`, `cur` is equal to `i`**

Explanation: The code `cur = i` assigns the value of `i` to `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `cur` now holds the same value as `i`, while `M` and the condition of `i` being within the bounds of `M` remain unaffected.
