Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Defining the Function:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from input.
   - It defines a function `func_1(s)` to perform the balanced shuffle operation.

2. **Creating the Balance Dictionary:**
   - The function calculates the balance at each position in the string.
   - A dictionary `d` is used to store the balance at each index.
   - The balance is incremented by 1 for an opening parenthesis `(` and decremented by 1 for a closing parenthesis `)`.
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`.

3. **Sorting the Balance Dictionary:**
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the balance values and positions.
   - The sorting is done using a lambda function that sorts by balance value (ascending) and position (descending) in case of ties.

4. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The sorted dictionary items are iterated over to construct the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the original string `s` at the sorted positions.

### Correctness Check

1. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The balance calculation is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Sorting Logic:**
   - The sorting logic is correct. It ensures that the sequence is sorted based on the balance and position as required.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - The result string is constructed by appending characters from the original string at the sorted positions, which is correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where the input string might start with an opening parenthesis or end with a closing parenthesis correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
