Output State: `i` is 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999899, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing [99999899, -99999998, 99999899], `t` is 2.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will become 1 (since the loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to 1). The value of `i` remains 1 because it was initialized to 0 and never changed inside the loop. The `max` variable decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 99999899, and the `min` variable increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches -99999998. The `ans` list accumulates the values of `max` and `min` based on the conditions in the loop, resulting in the list [99999899, -99999998, 99999899]. The variable `t` keeps track of the number of iterations and ends up being 2.
