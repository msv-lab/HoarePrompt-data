Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` equals `n`
- `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop
- `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop
- `left` is 0
- `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0
- The current value of `left` remains 0
- `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`

The `print(left)` statement will print the value of the variable `left`.

Since it is explicitly stated that `left` is 0, the output will be:

Output: **0**
