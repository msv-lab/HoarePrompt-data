Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using whitespace as the delimiter.**

In this scenario, the value of `t` is updated to be the first element of the `data` list converted to an integer. The values of `n`, `s`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial states.
