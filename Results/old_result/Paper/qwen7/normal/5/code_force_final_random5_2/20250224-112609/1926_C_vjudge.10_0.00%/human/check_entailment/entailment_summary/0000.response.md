Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
2. The program initializes `soma` to 0 and then iterates `N` times, reading an integer `n` in each iteration. It then calls `func_1(i)` for each `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, adding the result to `soma`.
3. However, the problem requires summing the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`, inclusive. The current implementation instead sums the digits of numbers from 0 to `n-1` for each test case, which is incorrect.
4. Additionally, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of digits of a number, but it is being called incorrectly in the loop.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the required logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
