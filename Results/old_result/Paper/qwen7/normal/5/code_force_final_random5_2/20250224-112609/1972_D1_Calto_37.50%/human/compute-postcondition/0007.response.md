Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`, `cnt` is `cnt + (n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) + ((i + 1) > 1)**.

Explanation: The code `y = i * i` assigns the value of `i * i` to `y`. All other variables (`m`, `x`, `n`, `i`, `cnt`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 1 is still valid. The value of `x` remains as `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is now updated to `i * i`, and `cnt` remains as `cnt + (n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) + ((i + 1) > 1)`.
