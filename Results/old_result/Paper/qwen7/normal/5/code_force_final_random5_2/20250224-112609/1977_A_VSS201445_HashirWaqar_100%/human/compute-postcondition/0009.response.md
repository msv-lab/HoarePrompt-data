Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, and `n` and `m` are converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them to integers. It then assigns these integer values to `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code.
