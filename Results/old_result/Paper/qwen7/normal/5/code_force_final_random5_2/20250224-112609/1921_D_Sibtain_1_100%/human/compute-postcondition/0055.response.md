Postcondition: **`k` is equal to the length of the sorted list `a`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` and `j` have been appropriately incremented, and the loop has completed all iterations. Additionally, `c` is a list of integers obtained from input sorted in reverse order, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and the set of `a` and `c` are singletons with the same element, so `ans`, `i`, `j`, `c`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since there is no modification of the variables `ans`, `i`, `j`, `c`, `n`, and `m` in either part of the if-else statement. The only difference is the condition under which the if part is executed, but the postcondition does not change as a result.
