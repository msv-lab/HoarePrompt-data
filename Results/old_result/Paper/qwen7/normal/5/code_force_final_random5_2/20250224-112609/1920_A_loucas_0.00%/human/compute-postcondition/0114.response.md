Output State: **`innerLoop` is greater than 2, `i` is either within the range `[max(big), min(less)) + 1)` and not in `no`, or `i` is equal to `num` and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, `less` contains at least 3 integers, `no` contains at least 3 integers, `big` contains at least 1 integer, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1` which is 2, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is the fourth input integer, and `num` is the value of `i` when it was last assigned in the loop.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `innerLoop` will be greater than 2 since the loop has executed at least 3 times. The variable `i` will be either within the range `[max(big), min(less)) + 1)` and not in `no`, or it will be equal to `num` and we would have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The list `less` will contain at least 3 integers, `no` will contain at least 3 integers, and `big` will contain at least 1 integer. The variable `iterable2` will be set to `innerLoop - 1`, which is 2. The values of `x` and `a` will remain as the third and fourth input integers, respectively. The variable `num` will hold the value of `i` when it was last assigned in the loop.
