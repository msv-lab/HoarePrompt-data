Output State: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, where each element is accessed using `val_a[0]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `sub_summ` will contain the sum of the first element (`val_a[0]`) from each sublist in `sec_arr`. The condition for the loop to execute all iterations is that `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are iterations, which in this case is the total number of sublists in `sec_arr`.
