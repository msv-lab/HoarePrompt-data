Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `input()` and converts it to an integer.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: It then iterates over each test case using a loop that runs `kreker` times.
3. **Function Call**: Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1()`. However, the function `func_1()` does not take any arguments, but the input inside `func_1()` expects two integers `n` and `m`. This mismatch could cause an error.
4. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input and checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints 'Yes', otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Analysis:
- The main issue is that the function `func_1()` is called without passing any arguments, but it tries to read input which will cause an error because there is no input provided to the function.
- To fix this, the function should be called with the necessary arguments, or the function should be modified to accept and use these arguments directly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, m)

def func_1(n, m):
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the mismatch between the function call and its definition. After correcting the function call, the program will work as expected.

**Correctness: False**
