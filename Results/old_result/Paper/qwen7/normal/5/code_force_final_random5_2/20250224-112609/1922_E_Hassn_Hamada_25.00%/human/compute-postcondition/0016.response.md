Output State: **`number` must be at least 255, `i` is 3, `size` is 8**

The code `sequence.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `sequence`. However, since `sequence` was not defined in the initial state, it remains undefined. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `number` and `size` remain unchanged.
