Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by comparing \( n \) and \( m \) directly. However, there's an issue with how the function `func_1` is called within the loop. The function `func_1` is defined to read and process a single test case, but it is called without passing any arguments in the loop. This means that `func_1` will try to read from `input()` repeatedly without any new input being provided, leading to undefined behavior or potential errors.

To fix this, the function call inside the loop should pass the values of \( n \) and \( m \) as arguments. Alternatively, the function could be modified to accept these values directly instead of reading them from `input()`.

However, based on the provided execution summary, which states that the function processes a test case and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison between \( n \) and \( m \), the logic inside the function itself is correct. The issue lies in how the function is called in the loop, not in the function's implementation.

Given the execution summary and the logic inside `func_1`, the function itself is correct for processing each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program depends on fixing the function call in the loop.

Correctness: **False**
