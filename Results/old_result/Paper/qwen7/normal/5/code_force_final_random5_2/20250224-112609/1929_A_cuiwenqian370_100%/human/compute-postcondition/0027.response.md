Output State: `t` must be exactly 0, `index` is equal to the total length of all `n` values plus the initial `index` value, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations since `t` is 0. The `index` variable points to the position right after the last processed element in the `data` list. The `results` list contains the outputs of `func_1(array)` for each of the `t` iterations that were initially specified.
