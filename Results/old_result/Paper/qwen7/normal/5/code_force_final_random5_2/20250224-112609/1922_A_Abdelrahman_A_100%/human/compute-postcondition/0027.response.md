Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in c:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `c`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the string `c`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `c` is a non-empty string.
   - `no` is False.
   - `counter` is increased by 1 (this information is not directly relevant to the loop head).

4. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must still contain at least one character. If `c` becomes an empty string, the loop will terminate.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since `c` must still be a non-empty string for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `c` is not empty. Additionally, since `x` is the current character being processed in the loop, it will be the first character of the remaining string `c`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `c` must be a non-empty string (since it was non-empty at the end of the previous iteration and we need it to still be non-empty for the loop to continue).
- `x` will be the first character of the remaining string `c`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the first character of `c`**
