Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The `range(int(input()))` function will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `int(input())`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` will be 0.

3. **Determine the Value of `int(input())`**: The value of `int(input())` is the number of test cases, denoted as `t`. According to the problem statement, `1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and that the input value (which determines the number of iterations) is within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4**.
