Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx2` is `i`.**

This means that `idx2` is now assigned the value of `i`, which is `n - 1`. All other variables retain their initial or unchanged states.
