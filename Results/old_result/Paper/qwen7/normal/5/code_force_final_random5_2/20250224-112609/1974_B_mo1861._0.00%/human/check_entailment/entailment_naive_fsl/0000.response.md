Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the string. Specifically, the issue lies in the `char_map` creation process. The mapping should pair each character in the sorted unique set of characters with its symmetric counterpart, but the current implementation incorrectly maps characters.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`. The unique characters in sorted order are `cdefors`, and their symmetric counterparts should be `crdesof`. However, the current implementation creates the `char_map` as follows:

- `c` -> `s`
- `d` -> `r`
- `e` -> `e`
- `f` -> `d`
- `o` -> `c`
- `r` -> `f`
- `s` -> `o`

This results in the incorrect decoded string `"sreorfsoc"`, which is different from the expected `"codeforces"`.

To fix this, the `char_map` should map each character to its symmetric counterpart correctly. Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    for i in range(len(unique_chars)):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[-(i + 1)]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all test cases.
