Output State: `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens` contains the frequency of each integer in `num_list`, `res` is the sum of `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 for all `cnt` where `cnt` >= 3, plus the sum of `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count` for all `cnt` where `cnt` >= 2, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `total_count` will be the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`. The variable `res` will accumulate the calculated values based on the conditions inside the loop for each count in `num_of_lens`. Specifically, it will add `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 to `res` for every `cnt` that is 3 or more, and it will also add `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count` to `res` for every `cnt` that is 2 or more. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
