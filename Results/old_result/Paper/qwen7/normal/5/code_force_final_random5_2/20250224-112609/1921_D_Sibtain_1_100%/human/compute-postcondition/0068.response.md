Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable `k` is being iterated over the range of `len(a)`. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `k`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `k`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `k` is within the range of `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since `k` starts from `len(a) - 1` and the loop decrements `k` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `k` will be `len(a) - 2`.

5. **Other variables**: The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `j`, `t1`, and `t2`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop itself. They remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`k` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 2.**
