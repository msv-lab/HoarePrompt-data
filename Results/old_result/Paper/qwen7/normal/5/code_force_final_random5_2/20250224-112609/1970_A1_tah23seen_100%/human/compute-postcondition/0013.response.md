Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `d[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether the first character of `s` is "(", `d[2]` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the value of `d[2]` (since `i` is 1) to be `d[1] + 1`. Given that `d[1]` is either 1 or -1, `d[2]` will be 2 or 0 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
