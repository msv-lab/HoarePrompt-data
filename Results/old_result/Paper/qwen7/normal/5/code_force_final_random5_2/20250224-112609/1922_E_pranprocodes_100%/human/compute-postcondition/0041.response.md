Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999899, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing [99999999, 99999899, -99999998], `t` is 2.**

Explanation: The `ans.reverse()` method reverses the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains the values `[99999899, 99999999, -99999998]`. After reversing, `ans` becomes `[99999999, 99999899, -99999998]`. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
