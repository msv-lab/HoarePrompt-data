Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):`
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `x`, and the range calculation.

2. **Understand the Range Calculation:**
   - The range starts from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`.
     - If `x` is even (`x % 2 == 0`), the range starts from `2`.
     - If `x` is odd, the range starts from `1`.
   - The range ends at `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - The step size is `2`.

3. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer such that the remainder of `x` divided by `i` is 0, and `l` is a list containing at least one element `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.
   - The loop condition checks if `i` is within the specified range and if `x` is divisible by `i`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be within the range and `x` must be divisible by `i`.
   - The current `i` is such that `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - The next `i` should be the next odd number within the range.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - We need to ensure that `i + 2` is still within the range and `x` is divisible by `i + 2`.

6. **Determine the New State:**
   - `x` remains the same as it is not changed inside the loop.
   - `i` becomes `i + 2`.
   - `l` and `ans` remain unchanged as per the postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer such that the remainder of `x` divided by `i` is 0 and `i` is `i + 2`, and `l` is a list containing at least one element `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.**
