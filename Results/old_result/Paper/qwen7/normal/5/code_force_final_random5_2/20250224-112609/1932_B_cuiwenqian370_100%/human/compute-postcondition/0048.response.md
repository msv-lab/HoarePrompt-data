Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the given state before the loop, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is also mentioned as a variable in the loop head.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n > 1` because the range function generates values from 1 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially equal to `n`, and the loop requires `i` to start from 1, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1.
   - We also need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 so that the loop can execute.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `last_year`, `next_year`, `a`, `results`, and `index` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
