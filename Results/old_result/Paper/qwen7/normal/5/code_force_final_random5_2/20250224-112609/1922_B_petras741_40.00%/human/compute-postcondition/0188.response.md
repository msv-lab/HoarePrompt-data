Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the condition `range(1, eta_ln)`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j < eta_ln`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `rho` is updated to `rho + q[eta[j]]`.
   - If `j` is greater than 1000, the function breaks out of the loop.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < eta_ln`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `eta_ln`.
   - The value of `res`, `rho`, and the list `eta` remain unchanged until the next iteration starts.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than `eta_ln`.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `j` is `j + 1`, `rho` is equal to `rho + q[eta[j]]`, and `j` must be less than `eta_ln`**.
