You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `match_c` will be either True or False, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `n` will be greater than 0. Additionally, either both `match_a_b` and `match_c` will be True, or `match_a_b` will be False.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the loop has processed all given inputs (`t` times), and for each iteration, it has checked if `template` matches `a` and `b` under certain conditions and compared `template` with `c`. The final values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` depend on these comparisons across all iterations. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False for any iteration, `match_c` will remain False. Otherwise, `match_c` will be True if there is no such condition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it constructs a template string based on the comparison of a and b. It then checks if the template matches a and b under specific conditions and compares the template with c. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the template matches a and b but not c, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**: The function constructs a template based on the characters of `a` and `b`. If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the character from `a` directly to the template. If they are different, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template. This ensures that both `a` and `b` will match the template if the conditions are met.

2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - For `a` and `b` to match the template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must match.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must not match the lowercase version of the template character.
   - For `c` to not match the template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in `c` must not match.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in `c` must match the lowercase version of the template character.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The function checks if `a` and `b` match the constructed template by iterating through each character and ensuring the conditions are met.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template under the same conditions.

4. **Output**:
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The logic for constructing the template and checking the matching conditions seems correct based on the problem statement.
- The implementation handles the conditions for both `a`, `b`, and `c` correctly.
- The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the function.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
