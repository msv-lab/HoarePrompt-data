Output State: **`h1` is '10', `m1` is equal to the string `m`, `time` is an empty string**.

The code assigns the string `'10'` to the variable `h1`. This changes the value of `h1` from an empty string to `'10'`. The values of `m1` and `time` remain unchanged as they were initially set to the string `m` and an empty string respectively.
