Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is an integer + 1 (or 0 if `j` was 30), `pre` is the same array with `pre[j][1]` incremented by 1, and `suf` is the same array except `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements the second element (`[1]`) of the `suf` array at index `j` by 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
