Output State: **`cur` is increased by 1, all other values in `M` remain the same, the list `N` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `T` is decreased by the total number of iterations the loop executed, and the sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`.**

This means that the variable `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables (`M`, `N`, `T`, and `S`) retain their previous states as described in the initial conditions.
