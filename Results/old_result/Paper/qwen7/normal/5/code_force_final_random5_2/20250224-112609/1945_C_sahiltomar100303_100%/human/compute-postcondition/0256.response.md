Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is `mid`, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is decreased by 1, and `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`.**

The code `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. Since `trightZero` was previously equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, after decrementing, its new value is one less than before. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
