Postcondition: **`cur` is an integer, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least two fewer elements, and `M` is a dictionary. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
