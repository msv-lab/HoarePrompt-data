Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is an integer decreased by 1, `rightZero` and `rightOne` are updated based on the character at position `left`. If the character at position `left` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1. If the character at position `left` is not '0', then `leftOne` (which was previously `leftOne - 1`) and `rightOne` are increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `left` has been decreased by 1, and the values of `rightZero` and `rightOne` have been updated based on the character at the new position of `left`.
