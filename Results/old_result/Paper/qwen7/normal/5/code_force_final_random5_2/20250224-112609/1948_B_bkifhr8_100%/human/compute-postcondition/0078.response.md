Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is still set to False, and `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by splitting the input string (which is expected to contain space-separated integers) and converting each element to an integer. The original values of `i`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The new list `arr` contains the integers that were input by the user.
