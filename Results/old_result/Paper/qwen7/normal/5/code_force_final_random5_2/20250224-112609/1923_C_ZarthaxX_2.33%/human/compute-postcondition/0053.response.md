Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `c` of n positive integers and handles q queries. For each query, it checks a range from index l_i to r_i within the list `c` and returns the sum of elements within that range.**

This means the function is designed to take a predefined list `c` and a number of queries `q`. Each query specifies a range within the list, and the function calculates and returns the sum of the elements within that specified range.
