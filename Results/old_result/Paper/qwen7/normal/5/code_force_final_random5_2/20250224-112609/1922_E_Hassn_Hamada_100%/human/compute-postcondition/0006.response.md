Output State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`**

Explanation: The code assigns `i + 1` to `size` and `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)` to `value`. Since `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `size` will be `i + 1` and `value` will be calculated based on the expression `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`. The initial values of `size_overlap` and the condition on `i` remain unchanged.
