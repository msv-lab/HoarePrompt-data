Output State: **`s[i]` is not equal to '(', `i` is an index within the string `s`, `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`**

The code updates the value of `d[i + 1]` to be `d[i] - 1`. Since `s[i]` is not equal to '(' and `i` is an index within the string `s`, these conditions remain unchanged. The only change is that `d[i + 1]` is now `d[i] - 1`.
