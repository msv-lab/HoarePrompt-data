Output State: **`b` must contain at least one character, `i` is 2, `s` is updated by adding the character corresponding to the next character in `b` from the `char_map`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s += char_map[c]` updates the string `s` by appending the character from `char_map` that corresponds to the character `c`. Here, `c` is the next character in the string `b`. The initial state of `b` must contain at least one character, `i` remains unchanged at 2, and `s` is updated by adding the character from `char_map` corresponding to the next character in `b`. The other variables remain in their initial states.
