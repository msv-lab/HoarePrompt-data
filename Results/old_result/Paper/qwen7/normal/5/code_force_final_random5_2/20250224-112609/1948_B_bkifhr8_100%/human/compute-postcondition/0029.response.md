Output State: **`ans` remains `False`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is `m - 3`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be equal to the integer value of the last element of `arr` (before index adjustment) concatenated with the element at index `i` in `arr`, `nums` is a list containing the integer value of the last element of `arr` (before index adjustment) concatenated with the element at index `i` in `arr`, and `nums` is now a list of integers created by converting the last element of `arr` (before index adjustment) to an integer and appending the element at index `i` in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
