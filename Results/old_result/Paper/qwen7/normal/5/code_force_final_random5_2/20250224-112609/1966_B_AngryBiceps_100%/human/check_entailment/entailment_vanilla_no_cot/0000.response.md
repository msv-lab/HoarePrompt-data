Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Here are the main problems:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for "NO" Output**: The conditions used to determine when to print "NO" are not sufficient. Specifically, the logic checks if the first and last rows are different but does not account for other configurations where making all squares the same color might still be possible.

2. **Insufficient Handling of Grid Operations**: The solution does not simulate the operations described in the problem statement. It only checks some superficial conditions without actually performing the required operations to see if they can lead to a uniform grid.

3. **Incomplete Check for Uniformity**: The conditions for printing "YES" are too broad. The solution should check if there exists a way to make all cells the same color through the allowed operations, rather than just checking for trivial conditions.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, one needs to consider the following:

- **Check Rows and Columns**: Ensure that all rows and columns can be made uniform.
- **Simulate Operations**: Simulate the operations to see if it's possible to make the entire grid a single color.

Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach to solving the problem:

```python
def can_make_uniform():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        all_rows_same = all(row == grid[0] for row in grid)
        
        # Check if all columns are the same
        all_columns_same = True
        for col in range(m):
            if any(grid[row][col] != grid[0][col] for row in range(n)):
                all_columns_same = False
                break
        
        # If either all rows or all columns are the same, it's possible to make the grid uniform
        if all_rows_same or all_columns_same:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Call the function
can_make_uniform()
```

This approach checks if all rows or all columns are the same initially. If so, it's possible to make the entire grid uniform using the allowed operations. Otherwise, it prints "NO".
