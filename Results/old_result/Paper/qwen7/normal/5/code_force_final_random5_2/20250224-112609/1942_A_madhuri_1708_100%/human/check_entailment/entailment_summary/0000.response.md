Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of \(n\) cyclic shifts of \(a\) are sorted.
2. The provided code does not correctly address this requirement. It only handles specific cases where \(k \geq 2\) and \(n = k\), or \(k < 2\). It does not handle other cases where \(k < n\) and \(n > k\).
3. For \(k < 2\), the code prints a list with \(n\) occurrences of integers starting from 1 up to \(n\), which does not guarantee exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts.
4. For \(k \geq 2\) and \(n \neq k\), the code prints \(-1\), which is incorrect because there can be arrays that meet the criteria even when \(n \neq k\).

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
