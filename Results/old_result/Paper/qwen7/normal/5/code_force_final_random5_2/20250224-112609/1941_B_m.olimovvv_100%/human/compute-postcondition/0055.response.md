Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is incremented by 1, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the value of the original `b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of the original `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is set to 0.**

This means that the value of `b[i + 1]` is now the original value of `b[i + 1]` minus twice the original value of `b[i]`. Similarly, the value of `b[i + 2]` is now the original value of `b[i + 2]` minus the original value of `b[i]`. The value of `b[i]` is now 0. The values of `a` and `i` remain as per their postconditions, and the loop or if statement condition regarding `b[i]` being less than 0 is checked again.
