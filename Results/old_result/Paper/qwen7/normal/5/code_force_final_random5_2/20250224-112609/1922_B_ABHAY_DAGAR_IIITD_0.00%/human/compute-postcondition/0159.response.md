Postcondition: `total_count` is `cnt` + 2, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, `res` is now `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * (`cnt` + 1) + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count`, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.

This postcondition reflects that if the condition `cnt >= 2` is true, then `res` is updated to include an additional term involving `total_count`. If the condition is false, the original value of `res` is retained as per the else part, which in this case is essentially the same as the if part since the else part is not specified and thus does not change the state.
