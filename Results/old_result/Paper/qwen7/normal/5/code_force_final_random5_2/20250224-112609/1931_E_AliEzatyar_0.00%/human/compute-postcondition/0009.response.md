Output State: **`counter` is 2, `num` has at least one element, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, and `num[i]` is not '0'**

Explanation: Initially, `counter` is 1 if the element at position `len(num) - 2` is '0', otherwise, `counter` remains 0. After executing `counter += 1`, `counter` is incremented by 1. Since the initial condition states that `counter` is 1 if the element at position `len(num) - 2` is '0', and `num[i]` is not '0', `counter` cannot be 1 initially. Therefore, it must be 0. After incrementing, `counter` becomes 1. However, the code increments `counter` from 0 to 1, making it 1. But since the initial state already had `counter` as 1 under the condition that `num[i]` is not '0', it gets incremented to 2. The other variables (`num`, `i`, and `num[i]`) remain unchanged.
