Output State: `i` is 4, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `coord` is a list containing three tuples. The first tuple is (4, an integer from input), the second tuple is (an integer from input, an integer from input), and the third tuple is (another integer from input, another integer from input).

This means after the loop completes all its iterations (4 times), the variable `i` will be 4. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the last input integers provided by the user during the third iteration of the loop. The list `coord` will contain three tuples, each representing a pair of integers `(x, y)` entered by the user in each iteration of the loop.
