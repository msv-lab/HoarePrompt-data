Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` (where `x` is an element from `nums`) and its value is the count of occurrences of `x` in `nums`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

### Loop Head:
```
for x in nums:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over each element in `nums`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `nums` to iterate over.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens` remains unchanged because it is not directly modified within the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not directly modified within the loop.
   - `nums` loses one element since `x` is processed in the loop body.
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not directly modified within the loop.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since `x` is processed in the loop body but not defined or modified outside the loop, we do not need to adjust `x` itself.
- We need to ensure that `nums` has at least one more element to proceed to the next iteration.

### Updated State:
- `num_of_lens` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `nums` must have at least one more element to proceed to the next iteration.
- `t` remains the same.

### Final Answer:
State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` (where `x` is an element from `nums`) and its value is the count of occurrences of `x` in `nums`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string that must have at least one more element; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
