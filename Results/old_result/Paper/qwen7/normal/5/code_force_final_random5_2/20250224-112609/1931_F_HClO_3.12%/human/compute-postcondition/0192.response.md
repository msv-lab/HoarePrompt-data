Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `idx2` is 0**.

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `i` (which is 0) to `idx2`. Since no other variables are affected, the conditions involving `i`, `n`, `p1`, `p2`, `l1`, and `l2` remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx2` is now 0.
