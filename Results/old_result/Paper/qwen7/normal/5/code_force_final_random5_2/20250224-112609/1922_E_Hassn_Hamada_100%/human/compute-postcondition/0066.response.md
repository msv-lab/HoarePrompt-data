Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `size` (since `size - overlap` determines the range).

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i < size - overlap`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `size` is 25
   - `overlap` is 3
   - `i` is 4
   - `sequence` contains [6, 7]

4. **Calculate the range for the loop**: The loop runs from `i` to `size - overlap`, which is `range(25 - 3) = range(22)`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `size - overlap`, which is 22. Currently, `i` is 4, so it is already within this range.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 5.
   - `size` and `overlap` remain unchanged.
   - `sequence` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`size` is 25, `overlap` is 3, `i` is 5, `sequence` contains [6, 7]**
