Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each test case individually. This is appropriate given the problem constraints.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The calculation of the prefix XOR array (`prefix`) is correct. It correctly computes the cumulative XOR values, which is essential for solving the problem.

3. **Initialization of `pre` and `suf`**: The initialization of the `pre` and `suf` matrices is done correctly, setting them up to count the occurrences of 0s and 1s for each bit position.

4. **Counting Bit Occurrences**: The nested loops for counting the occurrences of 0s and 1s for each bit position in the `prefix` array are correct. However, the logic inside these loops is flawed. Specifically, the `pre` and `suf` matrices are updated incorrectly, leading to incorrect counts.

5. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation of the answer (`ans`) is based on the incorrect counts stored in the `pre` and `suf` matrices. Since the counts are incorrect, the final answer will also be incorrect.

Given the issues in the `pre` and `suf` updates, the program will not produce the correct results.

Correctness: **False**
