Output State: **`left` is greater than 0; `leftZero` must be less than \((left + 1) // 2\); `rightOne` must be less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\); `leftOne` is decreased by 1; `s[left - 1]` is not equal to '0'**.

The value of `leftOne` is decreased by 1, but the exact new value of `leftOne` cannot be determined without knowing its original value. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
