Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, and `num` is the second element of `numbers`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `result` by calling the function `func_1` with `result` and `num` as arguments. The exact value of `result` after the function call depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but it is now stored in `result`. The `numbers` list remains unchanged, and `num` retains its original value as the second element of the list.
