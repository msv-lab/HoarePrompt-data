Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums` representing the amounts of water in each container. It calculates the mean amount of water per container and checks if the cumulative deviation from the mean remains non-negative throughout the iteration. If the cumulative deviation ever becomes negative or the total sum of `nums` is not divisible by its length, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES', indicating that the cumulative deviation from the mean balances out to zero.**
