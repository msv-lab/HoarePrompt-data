Output State: **`res` is the sum of all calculated values from the loop, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
