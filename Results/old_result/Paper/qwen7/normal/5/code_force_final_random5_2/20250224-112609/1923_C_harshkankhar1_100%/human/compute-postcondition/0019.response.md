Output State: **`x` is an integer from the first input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, and the program prints 'NO' if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y, otherwise it prints 'YES'.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them into `x` and `y`. The values of `a` and `b` are not defined or modified by this code, and the condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' is yet to be evaluated. Therefore, the initial conditions regarding the comparison between `a[y] - a[x - 1]` and `b[y] - b[x - 1]` remain unchanged.
