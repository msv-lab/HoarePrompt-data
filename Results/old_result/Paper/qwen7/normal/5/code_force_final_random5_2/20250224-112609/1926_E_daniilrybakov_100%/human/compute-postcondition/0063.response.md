Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` becomes 0, `k` is the input integer, `s` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), and `x` is the last value of `x` calculated before the loop exits.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. Each iteration halves `n`, doubles `m`, and adds `x` to `s`. The variable `x` is recalculated as \((n + 1) // 2\) at the start of each iteration. Once `n` reaches 0, the loop terminates. At this point, `n` will be 0, `m` will be \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), `s` will be the cumulative sum of all `x` values, and `x` will be the last value used in the loop, which corresponds to when `n` was 1.
