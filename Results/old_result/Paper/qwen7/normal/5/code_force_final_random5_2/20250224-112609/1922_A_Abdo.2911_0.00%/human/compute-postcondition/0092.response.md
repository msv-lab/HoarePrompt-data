Output State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False, `i` is `n`**

Explanation: The code sets `match_c` to `False`. This overrides the previous condition where `match_c` was determined based on the characters at index `n` in `c` and `template`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state, as they were not affected by the code. Therefore, `i` is still equal to `n`.
