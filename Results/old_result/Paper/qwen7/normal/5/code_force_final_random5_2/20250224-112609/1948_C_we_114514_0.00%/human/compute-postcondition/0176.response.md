Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are boolean values. If `j == n - 1` and `row1[j] == '>',` then `reachable_first_row` remains as True and `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is `n`. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` becomes False and `reachable_second_row` becomes True, and if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>',` the condition holds true.
