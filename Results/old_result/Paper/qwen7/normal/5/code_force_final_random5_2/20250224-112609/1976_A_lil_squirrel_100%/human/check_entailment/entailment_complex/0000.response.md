Reasoning:
1. The program correctly separates the characters in the password into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
2. It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
3. It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
4. It iterates through the password to ensure there is no digit immediately following a letter. If such a sequence is found, it returns 'NO'.
5. If none of the above conditions fail, it returns 'YES', indicating the password is strong according to the given criteria.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` matches the requirements perfectly. The function correctly identifies whether a password meets all the specified conditions for being strong.

Correctness: **True**
