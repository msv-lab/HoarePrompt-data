Output State: **`i` is 3, `last_year` is 4, `next_year` is 4, `a[1]` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The code `last_year = next_year` assigns the value of `next_year` (which is 4) to `last_year`. The values of `i` and `a[1]` remain unchanged, and `next_year` also remains 4 since it was not reassigned.
