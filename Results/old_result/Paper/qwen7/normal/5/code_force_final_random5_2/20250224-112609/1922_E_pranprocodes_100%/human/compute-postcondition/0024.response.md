Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be equal to 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing -99999999.**

Explanation: The code `min += 1` increments the value of `min` by 1. Initially, `min` is -99999999, so after executing the code, `min` becomes -99999998. The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
