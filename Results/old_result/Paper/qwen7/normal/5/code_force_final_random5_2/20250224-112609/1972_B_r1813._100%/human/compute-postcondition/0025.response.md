Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer minus 1.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[4]`.
   - `s` is now the string `data[5]`.
   - `index` is 7.
   - `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the string `s`.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is defined as the first element of `data` converted to an integer minus 1, if `t` is greater than 0, the loop can continue.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: To ensure the loop can execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (since it was `first_element_of_data - 1`).
- `n` remains the same, as it is not part of the loop head.
- `s` remains the same, as it is not part of the loop head.
- `index` remains the same, as it is not part of the loop head.
- `count_u` remains the same, as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `s` is now the string `data[5]`, `index` is 7, `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the string `s`**.
