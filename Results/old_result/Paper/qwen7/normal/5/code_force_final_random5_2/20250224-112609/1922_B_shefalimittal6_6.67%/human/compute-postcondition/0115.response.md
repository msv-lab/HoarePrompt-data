Output State: **`res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` increments `res` by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Since the initial condition states that `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and remains unchanged if `cnt` is less than 2, the value of `cnt` must be greater than or equal to 2 for this operation to occur. The value of `total_sum` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet.
