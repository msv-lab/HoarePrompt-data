Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is `mid`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is either equal to `trightZero - 1` or remains the same, and `trightOne` is either equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2 - 1` or remains the same.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If the condition `s[right] == '0'` is true, `leftZero` becomes 1 and `trightZero` decreases by 1. If the condition is false, `leftZero` remains unchanged (either 0 or 1 depending on the initial value) and `trightOne` decreases by 1 while `trightZero` remains the same.
