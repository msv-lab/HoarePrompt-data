Output State: `left` will be 0; `rightZero` will be the total number of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`; `rightOne` will be the total number of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`; `leftZero` will be 0; `leftOne` will be 0; `leftMove` will be 0; `left` will be 0; `right` will be `n - 1`; `trightZero` will be unchanged; `trightOne` will be unchanged; `t` will be unchanged; `n` will be unchanged.

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `left` while the condition `left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)` holds true. This means that as long as there are more '0's or '1's on the left side compared to the right side (considering the balance of counts), the loop will continue to run. Once `left` reaches 0, the condition fails because `left` is no longer greater than 0. At this point, `leftZero` and `leftOne` will both be 0 since `left` has reached the start of the string, and `rightZero` and `rightOne` will hold the counts of '0's and '1's from `mid` to the end of the string `s`.
