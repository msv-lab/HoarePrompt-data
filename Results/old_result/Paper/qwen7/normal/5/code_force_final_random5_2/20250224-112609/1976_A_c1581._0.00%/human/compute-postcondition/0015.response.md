Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `char` and `password`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the `password` string.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `char`: This variable holds the current character from the `password` string. After processing one character, it moves to the next character.
   - `password`: The `password` string remains the same throughout the loop as it is not modified within the loop. However, the position of `char` within `password` changes with each iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `password` is a string and does not change, we don't need to adjust its state.
   - `char` will be the next character in the `password` string after the current one.

5. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - If the first character of `password` was a digit, `digits` is a list containing that digit plus the appended `char`.
   - Otherwise, `letters` is a list with one additional element being that letter plus the appended `char`.

Since the loop has just started, we assume the first character of `password` could be either a digit or a letter. Therefore, we need to consider both cases:

- If the first character was a digit, `digits` will contain that digit plus the new `char`.
- If the first character was a letter, `letters` will contain that letter plus the new `char`.

However, since we are starting a new iteration, we cannot know which case applies yet. We simply move to the next character in `password`.

**Final State**:
State: **`char` is the next character in the `password` string, `password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.**
