Output State: **`total_count` is 0, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, `res` is `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value. Since `total_count` is 0 initially, the term `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` evaluates to 0, so `res` remains unchanged. All other variables remain in their initial states.
