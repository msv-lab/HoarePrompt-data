Postcondition: `cnt` is now either an empty list or contains the value `k`, `cur` is the highest value present in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` appears in `N`, all other values in `M` will be zero or represent counts of numbers less than `cur` in `N`, the list `N` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `T` is decreased by the total number of iterations the loop executed, and `M` must contain at least one key. If `M[k]` equals 1, then `cnt` contains `k`; otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.
