Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)`.
   - This means the loop depends on three conditions involving the list at indices `i`, `i-1`, and `i+1`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `list` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the length of the list, and `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
   - `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 2.

3. **Check each condition**:
   - `list[i] > 1`: Since `i` is 1, this condition checks if `list[1] > 1`.
   - `list[i - 1] > 0`: Since `i` is 1, this condition checks if `list[0] > 0`.
   - `list[i + 1] > 0`: Since `i` is 1, this condition checks if `list[2] > 0`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, all three conditions must be true.
   - `list[1]` must be greater than 1.
   - `list[0]` must be greater than 0.
   - `list[2]` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the values of `list[0]`, `list[1]`, and `list[2]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`list` is a list of integers where `list[0]` is greater than 0, `list[1]` is greater than 1, and `list[2]` is greater than 0, and the length of the list `n` is such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5**
