### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The beauty can be maximized by rearranging the elements of the array.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The function correctly computes the beauty of the array but does not account for rearrangement to maximize the beauty. Instead, it computes the beauty of the sorted array, which is not necessarily the maximum possible beauty.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

4. **Rearrangement for Maximum Beauty**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should place the largest element at one end and the smallest at the other, alternating between the largest and smallest elements.
   - For example, if the array is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, the maximum beauty is achieved by rearranging it to `[7, 1, 5, 3]` or `[3, 5, 1, 7]`.

5. **Implementation Check**:
   - The current implementation does not perform any rearrangement; it simply sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
   - Sorting the array does not guarantee the maximum beauty because the optimal arrangement involves placing the largest and smallest elements strategically.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not rearrange the array to achieve the maximum beauty. Instead, it calculates the beauty of the sorted array, which is not always the maximum possible beauty.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
