### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that, when painted white, will turn all black cells in the strip to white. This means we need to identify the farthest left and right black cells and calculate the distance between them plus one (since the segment includes both endpoints).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - `inpstr = input()` reads a string from the standard input.
   - `ind1` and `ind2` are initialized to 0.
   - The first `for` loop iterates through the string to find the index of the first black cell ('B') and stores it in `ind1`.
   - The second `for` loop iterates from the end of the string to find the index of the last black cell ('B') and stores it in `ind2`.
   - The length of the strip minus `ind2 - 1` minus `ind1` is printed, which does not correctly compute the required segment length.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We should find the first black cell (`ind1`) and the last black cell (`ind2`).
   - The required segment length is `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.

4. **Error in Given Code**:
   - The calculation `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` is incorrect because it does not account for the positions of the black cells relative to each other.
   - The correct calculation should be `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
