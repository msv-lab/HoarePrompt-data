You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())

    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is 1 or 2 based on the value of `a[i]`, `b[1]` is 2, `b[2]` is 3, ..., `b[n]` is either 3 or 4, depending on the value of `a[i]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a[i]` is greater than 1 for all `i` from 1 to `n`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `x` will be either 1 or 2, depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not. The list `b` will have been updated such that each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) will be 3 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, or 4 if `a[i]` is not greater than 1. The conditions that `n` must be at least 3 and that `a[i]` must be greater than 1 for all `i` from 1 to `n` must still hold.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `x` and `y` will be determined by the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variables `x` and `y` will hold the values from the last input provided to the loop. For each input pair `(x, y)`, the program will print 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or if `x == y`, otherwise it will print 'YES'. The final output state will reflect the results of all these comparisons.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` and `y` will be set to the values of the last input pair provided to the loop. The program will have printed 'NO' or 'YES' for each input pair based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] >= b[y] - b[x - 1]` and `x != y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( q \), followed by a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. It then handles \( q \) queries, each consisting of two integers \( x \) and \( y \). Based on the values in the list \( a \), the function compares the sums of subarrays defined by the queries and prints 'YES' if the sum of the subarray from index \( x \) to \( y \) in list \( a \) is greater than or equal to the corresponding sum in list \( b \), and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value but prints the results of the queries.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the array `c` of length `n`.
   - It then reads `q` queries, each consisting of `l_i` and `r_i`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is called for each test case.
   - It initializes `a` with a zero-padded version of the input array `c` (to handle edge cases).
   - It computes a new array `b` where `b[i]` represents the cumulative sum of a modified sequence starting from `1` if `a[i] > 1` else `2`.
   - It then computes the prefix sums of `a` and stores them in `a`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of elements in the subarray `c[l_i]` to `c[r_i]` using the prefix sums stored in `a`.
   - It also checks if the subarray is good by comparing the sum of the subarray with the corresponding value in `b`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than the corresponding value in `b` or if the subarray has only one element, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization and Prefix Sums:**
   - The initialization of `b` ensures that `b[i]` is the sum of the smallest possible values that can form the subarray `a[1:i]` while satisfying the condition \(a_i \neq b_i\).
   - The prefix sums `a` are correctly computed.

2. **Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The subarray sum calculation using `a` is correct. `a[r] - a[l-1]` gives the sum of the subarray `c[l]` to `c[r]`.

3. **Good Subarray Check:**
   - The check `if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y:` is correct. It ensures that the sum of the subarray is not equal to the corresponding value in `b` and handles the case where the subarray has only one element.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The steps are logically sound and the implementation is correct.
