Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are boolean values, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is `n + 1`. If `row1[j] == '>'`, then `reachable_first_row` is a boolean value and `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` is False and `reachable_second_row` is True, and if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, the condition holds true.
