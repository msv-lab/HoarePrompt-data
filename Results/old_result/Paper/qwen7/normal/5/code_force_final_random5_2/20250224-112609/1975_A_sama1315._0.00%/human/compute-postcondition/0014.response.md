Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2 * n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`, `t` is t - 1**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n`. This changes the value of `n`, but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
