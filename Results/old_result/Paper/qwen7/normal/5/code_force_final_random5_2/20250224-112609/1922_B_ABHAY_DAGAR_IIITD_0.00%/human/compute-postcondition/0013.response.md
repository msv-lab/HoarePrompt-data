Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens[x]` is 3, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one element excluding the first element, which is `x`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by 1. Since `num_of_lens[x]` was initially 2, it is now 3. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
