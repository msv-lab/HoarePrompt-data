Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * max(t1, t2)`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 3] - c[len(c) - 3])`**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values. Specifically, `k` remains `len(a) - 1`, `ans` remains `ans + 2 * max(t1, t2)`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `j` remains 3, `t1` is recalculated as `abs(a[i] - c[i])` (with `i` now being `i + 1`), and `t2` remains `abs(a[len(a) - 3] - c[len(c) - 3])`.
