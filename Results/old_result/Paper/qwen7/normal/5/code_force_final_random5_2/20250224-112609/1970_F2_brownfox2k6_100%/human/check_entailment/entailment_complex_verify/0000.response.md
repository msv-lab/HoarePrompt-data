### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version to evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function correctly updates the position of a player or a ball based on the direction of movement.
- The function handles the four possible directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and updates the position accordingly.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function correctly identifies and eliminates players when they are in the same position as a Bludger.
- It prints the elimination message and updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]`.

#### Main Logic:
- The main logic of the program correctly handles the following:
  1. **Reading Input**: It reads the dimensions of the field, the initial positions of players, goals, the Bludger, and the Quaffle.
  2. **Processing Actions**: It processes each action (movement, catching, throwing) and updates the positions and states of the entities accordingly.
  3. **Scoring Points**: It correctly checks if a player scores a point by leaving the Quaffle in the opponent's goal and updates the score.
  4. **Eliminating Players**: It correctly identifies and eliminates players when they are hit by a Bludger.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions and initializes the field, players, goals, Bludger, and Quaffle.

2. **Processing Actions**:
   - The program correctly handles movements (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
   - It correctly handles catching the Quaffle (`C`).
   - It correctly handles throwing the Quaffle (`T`).

3. **Scoring Points**:
   - When a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal, the program correctly increments the score and resets the Quaffle to the center of the field.

4. **Eliminating Players**:
   - When a player is hit by a Bludger, the program correctly identifies the player, prints the elimination message, and updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the score and the final state of the game.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements all the necessary functionalities to simulate the game according to the problem description. The original assessment was overly critical and did not account for the fact that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly handle the required operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately simulates the game according to the problem description.
