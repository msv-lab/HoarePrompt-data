Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`.

   - `i`: This is the index of the character in the sorted unique set of characters from the string `b`.
   - `c`: This is the character from the sorted unique set of characters from the string `b`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{c: 'z'}`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `char_map[c]` is 'y'.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, the value of `i` must be within the range of the sorted unique set of characters in `b`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next character `c` should be the second character in the sorted unique set of `b`.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `c` will be the second character in the sorted unique set of `b`.

5. **Update the `char_map` state**:
   - The current `char_map` has `{c: 'z'}` where `c` is the first character in the sorted unique set of `b`.
   - After the first iteration, `char_map[c]` is updated to 'y'.
   - For the next iteration, the new character `c` will be mapped to 'z'.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `b` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
- `char_map` will have the updated mapping for the new character `c` (the second character in the sorted unique set of `b`).
- `i` will be 2.
- `char_map[c]` will be 'z' for the new character `c`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {new_c: 'z'}, `i` is 2, and `char_map[new_c]` is 'z'**.

Here, `new_c` is the second character in the sorted unique set of `b`.
