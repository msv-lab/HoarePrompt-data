Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[n - 2]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, the value of `p[i]` is now specifically `mex - a[n - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
