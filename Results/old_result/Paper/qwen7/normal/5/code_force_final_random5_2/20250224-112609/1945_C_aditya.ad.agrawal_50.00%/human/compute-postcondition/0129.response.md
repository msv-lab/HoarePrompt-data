Output State: **`z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes three new variables: `dist`, `ans`, and `pos`. The value of `dist` is set to the absolute value of `n / 2`, `ans` is set to 0, and `pos` is also set to 0. The initial values of `z_l` and `o_l` remain unchanged.
