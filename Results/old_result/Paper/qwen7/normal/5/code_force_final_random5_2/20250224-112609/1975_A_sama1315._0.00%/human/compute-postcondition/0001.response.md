Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` takes the entire input data (a single string) stored in `input` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The original value of `t` remains unchanged, and a new variable `data` is created which holds the split input.
