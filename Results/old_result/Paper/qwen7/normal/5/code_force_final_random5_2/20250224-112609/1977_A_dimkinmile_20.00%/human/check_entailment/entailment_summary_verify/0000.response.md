### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step.

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes one cube.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes two integers `n` and `m` as input and prints "Yes" if `n >= m`, otherwise it prints "No". This is the current implementation of the function.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment is that the program is incorrect because it always prints "Yes" if `n >= m`, which is not always true. It fails to account for the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between `n` and `m`.

4. **Analysis**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, since each move changes the number of cubes by 1. If the difference is odd, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - The current implementation of `func_1()` does not check the parity of the difference between `n` and `m`. Instead, it simply checks if `n >= m`.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct logic should be to check if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If this condition is true, then it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves; otherwise, it is not.

6. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the current implementation with the provided examples:
     - For `n = 3` and `m = 3`: The difference is `3 - 3 = 0`, which is even, so the program correctly prints "Yes".
     - For `n = 2` and `m = 4`: The difference is `2 - 4 = -2`, which is even, but the program incorrectly prints "Yes".
     - For `n = 5` and `m = 3`: The difference is `5 - 3 = 2`, which is even, so the program correctly prints "Yes".

Given the analysis, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not properly account for the parity of the difference between `n` and `m`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
