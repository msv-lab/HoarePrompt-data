Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be at least `n`, meaning it has iterated through the entire string `s` from `mid` to `n-1`. For each '0' encountered in this range, `rightZero` will be incremented by 1, and for each '1', `rightOne` will be incremented by 1. The variables `trightZero` and `trightOne` will also reflect the total counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the string up to the last iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `rightZero` will contain the count of '0's in the substring from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` will contain the count of '1's in the same substring.
