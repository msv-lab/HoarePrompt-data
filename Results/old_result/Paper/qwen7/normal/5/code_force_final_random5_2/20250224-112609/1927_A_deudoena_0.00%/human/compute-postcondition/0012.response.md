Output State: **`j` is a string that is not equal to 'B', `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous value, and `ind1` is equal to the new value of `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the value of `j` remains a string not equal to 'B', `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `ind1` is set to the new value of `i`. Additionally, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
