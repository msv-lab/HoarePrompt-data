Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is 105, `s` is the string "bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", `j` is 122.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 97` to `j = 202` (inclusive). Since `k` is 105, the loop will iterate \(202 - 97 + 1 = 106\) times. Each iteration appends the character corresponding to the current value of `j` to the string `s`. After 106 iterations, `s` will contain all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. The final value of `j` will be 122, which is the ASCII value for the letter 'z'.
