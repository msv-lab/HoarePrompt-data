Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `l` is `[ans]`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `l = [ans]` does not affect the values of `i` or `ans`. It only changes the list `l` to contain the single element `ans`. The initial conditions for `i` becoming `i + 2` and `l` and `ans` remaining unchanged are preserved.
