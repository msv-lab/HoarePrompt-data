The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `password`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. Based on the given conditions, the function returns 'NO' in all cases except for one where it returns 'YES'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n`, and return 'YES' under specific conditions, while returning 'NO' in all other cases.
