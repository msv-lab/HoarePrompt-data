The function accepts a list of positive integers `arr` with a length between 2 and 50, inclusive, where each element is between 1 and 10^6, inclusive. It checks whether the list is non-decreasing (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next element). If the list is non-decreasing, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.
