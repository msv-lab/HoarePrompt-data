### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided program is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the function summaries, and the provided code.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1` and `func_2` for input handling, which are assumed to work correctly for reading input values.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads two lists of integers `a` and `b`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The program defines `func_3` to calculate Alice's profit.
   - `func_3` takes two arguments: `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - `main_ar` is expected to be the list of prices for Alice (`a`).
   - `sec_arr` is expected to be the list of prices for Bob (`b`).
   - The function calculates the sum of `val_a[0]` for all `val_a` in `sec_arr`, which is the total price Bob would pay if he bought all items from Alice.
   - It then iterates over `main_ar` and adds `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. This part is indeed incorrect because `val_b` is just an element from `b`, not a tuple with two elements. However, the function summary suggests that `sec_arr` is a list of integers, and the function should be calculating the sum of `b_i` for all items Alice buys.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The problem requires Alice to maximize her profit and Bob to minimize it.
   - The optimal strategy involves selecting the best items for Alice to buy such that the difference between Bob's payment and Alice's cost is maximized.
   - The given function does not correctly implement this logic. It incorrectly sums `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` instead of simply summing `b_i`.

However, the function summary provided for `func_3` suggests that it should sum `b_i` for all items Alice buys. Therefore, the function should be corrected as follows:

```python
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_b in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_b
    return sub_summ
```

With this correction, the function now correctly sums the prices Bob would pay for all items Alice buys. The rest of the program should correctly handle the logic for determining the optimal selection of items.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code and the function summary, the original assessment was accurate. The provided function `func_3` is still incorrect due to the misinterpretation of the input parameters. However, with the correct implementation of the function, the overall logic of the program can be made correct.

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect as currently implemented, but with the correct implementation of `func_3`, it can be made correct.
