Postcondition: `match_c` is True, if `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, where `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i].lower()` does not equal `template[i].lower()`, the conditions remain as `match_c` is True, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.
