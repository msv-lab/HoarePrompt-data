Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `index`, `t`, or `data`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
