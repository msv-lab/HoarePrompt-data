Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the specified operations.
2. The provided code has a few issues:
   - The `func_1` function does not correctly handle the logic of the problem. It sets the frequency of any number to `k` if it appears more than `k` times, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.
   - The main logic in the `else` block of the loop is flawed. It checks if `k` is present in the values of the frequency dictionary but this check is not necessary and does not solve the problem.
   - The logic to calculate the minimum number of cards should consider the frequency of each number modulo `k`.

Let's correct the approach:
- We need to count the frequency of each number.
- For each number, if its frequency is divisible by `k`, we can remove all such cards in one operation.
- If the frequency is not divisible by `k`, we can only remove `(frequency % k)` cards in one operation.
- Sum up the remaining cards for all numbers to get the minimum number of cards left.

Given the corrected approach, let's analyze the provided code:
- The `func_1` function is not needed as per the corrected logic.
- The main part of the code needs to be revised to correctly implement the logic.

Since the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described, the correctness is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
