Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be at least `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `rightZero` will be incremented by 1 for each '0' encountered from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `trightZero` will also reflect the total count of '0's from the start of the string up to the last index processed. Similarly, `rightOne` will be incremented by 1 for each '1' encountered in the same range, and `trightOne` will reflect the total count of '1's up to the last index processed.

In natural language, the final output state is: The loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` reaching or exceeding `n`. `rightZero` counts the number of '0's from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `trightZero` counts all '0's from the start of the string. `rightOne` counts the number of '1's from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `trightOne` counts all '1's from the start of the string.
