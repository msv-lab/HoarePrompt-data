Output State: **`last_digit_index` is 4 if the first character is a digit, and 3 if it is not; `i` is 4 if the first character is a digit, and 3 if it is not.**

Explanation: The code `last_digit_index = i` updates the value of `last_digit_index` to be the same as the value of `i`. Since the value of `i` depends on whether the first character is a digit (4 if it is, 3 if it is not), `last_digit_index` will also take on these values accordingly. The value of `char` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
