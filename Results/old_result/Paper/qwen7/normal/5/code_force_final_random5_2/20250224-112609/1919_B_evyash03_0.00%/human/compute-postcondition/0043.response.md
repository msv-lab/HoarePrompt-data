Output State: **The program returns the total number of times balance was reset to 0 because it became less than 0 during the iteration of the loop plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0.**

This means that the program will first return the count of times the balance was reset to 0. Then, it will check if the final balance is greater than 0 and add 1 to the count if it is.
