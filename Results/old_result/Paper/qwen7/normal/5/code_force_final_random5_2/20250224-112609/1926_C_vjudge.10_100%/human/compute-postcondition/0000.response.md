Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `inf` with the value `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`, which evaluates to `200001`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
