Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least one fewer element, and `M` is a dictionary.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
