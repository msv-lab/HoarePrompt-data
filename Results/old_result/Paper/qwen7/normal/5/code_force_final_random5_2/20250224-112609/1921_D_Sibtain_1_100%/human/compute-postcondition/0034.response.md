Output State: **`k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`**.

The code `t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])` calculates the absolute difference between the elements `a[i]` and `c[i]` and assigns it to `t1`. Since the values of `a[i]` and `c[i]` are not provided, `t1` is expressed as the absolute difference between these two elements. The value of `k` remains unchanged at 2.
