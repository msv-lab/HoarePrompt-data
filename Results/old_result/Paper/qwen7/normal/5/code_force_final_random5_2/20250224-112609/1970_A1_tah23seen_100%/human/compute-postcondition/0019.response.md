Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `d[2]` is either 2 or `d[1] - 1` depending on whether the second character of `s` is "(", `d[3]` is `d[2] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the value of `d[3]` to be `d[2] + 1`. Since `i` is 2, `d[i + 1]` translates to `d[3]`. The value of `d[2]` remains unchanged as it depends on the second character of `s`, which is not altered by the given code. Therefore, `d[3]` is updated to be one more than the current value of `d[2]`.
