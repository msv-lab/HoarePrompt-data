Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `no` is `True`, `i` is `1`, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the new input string, `counter` is `0`, and the last character of `c` is not specified.
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `counter` is incremented by 1, the value of `no` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement continues as normal.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `counter` is incremented by 1, the value of `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `x` is not found in both `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `counter` is incremented by 1; `no` is False; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `x` is not found in both `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
