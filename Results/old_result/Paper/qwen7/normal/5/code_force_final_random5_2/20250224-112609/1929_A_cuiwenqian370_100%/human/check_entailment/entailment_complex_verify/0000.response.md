### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \( a \), defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this, we need to strategically arrange the elements of the array. The key insight is that the beauty is maximized when the largest and smallest elements are placed at the ends of the array, and the next largest and smallest elements are placed next to them, and so on.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - While sorting the array might seem like a good approach, it doesn't necessarily yield the maximum beauty. Sorting places the elements in ascending order, which may not be the optimal arrangement for maximizing the beauty.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

#### Detailed Example:
Consider the input:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```

- **Original Assessment:**
  - The original assessment claims that sorting the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]` yields a beauty of 93, but the optimal arrangement is `[43, 100, 80, 90, 54]`, which gives a beauty of 123.
  - This is correct because sorting the array does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

- **Annotated Code:**
  - The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of `func_1` and `func_2`.
  - `func_1` calculates the beauty after sorting the array, which is not always the maximum beauty.
  - `func_2` processes multiple test cases and prints the results correctly.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not always find the maximum beauty because it relies on sorting the array, which does not guarantee the optimal arrangement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
