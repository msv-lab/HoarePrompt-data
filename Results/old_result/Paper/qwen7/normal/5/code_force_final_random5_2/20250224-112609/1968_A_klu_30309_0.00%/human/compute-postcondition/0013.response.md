Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `max_val` is `x - 1`
   - `x` is greater than 1
   - `y` is `x - 1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `y = x - 1` to `y = 1` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postconditions, we know that the loop modifies `max_val` if certain conditions are met.

4. **Postconditions After Loop Body Execution:**
   - If `x` is divisible by `y` and `2 * y` is less than `x`, then `max_val` remains `x - 1`.
   - Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block executed.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was decremented by 1 from its initial value `x - 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be `x - 2`.

6. **Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `y` is greater than 1.
   - Since `y` starts at `x - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, it will continue to be greater than 1 until `y` reaches 1.

7. **Final State Before Next Iteration:**
   - `max_val` remains `x - 1` unless the conditions inside the loop are met.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `y` is now `x - 2`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`max_val` is `x - 1`, `x` is greater than 1, `y` is `x - 2`**
