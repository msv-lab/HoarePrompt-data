Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container. The length of `nums` is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the sum of `nums` is divisible by n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), with each element in `nums` being in the range 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns 'NO' in all cases except when it returns 'YES', indicating that a certain condition is met.**
