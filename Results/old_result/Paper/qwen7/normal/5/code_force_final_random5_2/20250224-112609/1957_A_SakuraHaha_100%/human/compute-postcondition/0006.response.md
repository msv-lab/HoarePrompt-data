Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1` increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `x` is not defined in the context, it is assumed to be an element from the list `a`. The initial state of `cnt` is an empty dictionary, so when an element from `a` is encountered, it initializes the count for that element to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
