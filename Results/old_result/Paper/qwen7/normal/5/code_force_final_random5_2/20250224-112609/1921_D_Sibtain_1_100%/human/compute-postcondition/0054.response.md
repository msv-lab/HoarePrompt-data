The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since the loop has already completed all its iterations, there are no more iterations to move to. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is equal to the length of the sorted list `a`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` and `j` have been appropriately incremented, and the loop has completed all iterations. Additionally, `c` is a list of integers obtained from input sorted in reverse order, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and the set of `a` and `c` are singletons with the same element, so `ans`, `i`, `j`, `c`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
