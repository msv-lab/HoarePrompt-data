Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the first integer input.
   - `b` is the second integer input.
   - `c` is the third integer input.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < t`, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `i` should be 2 and `t` must still be within its original range (1 to 1000).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged from its initial value (since it is the upper limit of the range).
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input.**
