Output State: `data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 3 * n + 2 + n`, `t` is `t - 3`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, with a total length of `t` (initial value of `t` minus 3).

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `index` will be at the position right after the last processed array, `t` will have been decremented by the total number of iterations (which is 3), and `results` will contain the outcomes of applying `func_1` to each of the arrays processed during the loop iterations.
