Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is an input integer, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, indicating the type of constraint and the value x respectively. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
        if i not in no:
            num = i
            break
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `min(less) + 1`, and `num` will be equal to `i`. If `i` is not in the set `no`, the loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `x` and `a` will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. If `x` is 1, `a` will be appended to `big`; if `x` is 2, `a` will be appended to `less`; otherwise, `a` will be appended to `no`. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will contain all the values of `a` that correspond to the respective conditions across all iterations of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `i` is either within the range `[max(big), min(less)) + 1)` and not in `no`, or `i` is equal to `num` and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, `less` contains at least 3 integers, `no` contains at least 3 integers, `big` contains at least 1 integer, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1` which is 2, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is the fourth input integer, and `num` is the value of `i` when it was last assigned in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `num` is the maximum value between all elements in the `big` list, and `num` is not in the `no` list.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `iterable2` will have gone through every value from 0 to `innerLoop - 1`. The loop will iterate over the range defined by `max(big)` to `min(less)`, and it will break as soon as it finds an `i` that is not in the `no` list. Therefore, `num` will end up being the highest value in the `big` list that is not present in the `no` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
