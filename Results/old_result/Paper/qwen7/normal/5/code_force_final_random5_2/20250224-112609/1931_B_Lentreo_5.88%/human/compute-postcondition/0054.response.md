Output State: **`last` is the last element of `nums`, `n` is an input integer, `curr` is the sum of all elements in `nums` except those that are 0, each adjusted by subtractting `last` from it, `t` must be decreased by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of the list `nums` to the variable `last`. The other variables (`n`, `curr`, `t`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
