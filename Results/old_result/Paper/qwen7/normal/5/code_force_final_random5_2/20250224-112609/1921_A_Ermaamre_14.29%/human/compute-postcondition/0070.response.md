Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an input integer, `y3` is an input integer, `x4` is an input integer, `y4` is an input integer, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` is not equal to `x4` or `x3` is not equal to `x2`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`; `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an input integer, `y3` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x3` and `y3` respectively. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` is determined based on the conditions provided, but since those conditions depend on the values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, and `y4`, which are not specified, the exact value of `res` cannot be determined here. However, the format of `res` is defined based on the conditions given.
