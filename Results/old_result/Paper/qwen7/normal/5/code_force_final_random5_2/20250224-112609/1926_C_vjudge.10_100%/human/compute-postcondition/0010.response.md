Output State: **`i` is a positive integer and its string representation is non-empty (but one digit shorter than before), `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the current digit `x`.**

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increases the value of `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. The string representation of `i` remains a positive integer with one digit less than before, and `sum_value_digits` is updated by adding the integer value of `x` to its current value.
