Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, and the condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds. In the if part, `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. In the else part, either `a` is greater than or equal to `b` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
