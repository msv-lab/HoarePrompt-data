Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(mid)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(mid)` generates values from 0 to `mid - 1`.

3. **Determine the State of `mid`**: Since `mid` is defined as `n // 2`, and `n` is an input integer, the value of `mid` is dependent on `n`. For the loop to execute, `mid` must be at least 1 (since `range(0)` would generate no values).

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `mid` is at least 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be 0 (as it starts the loop).
- `mid` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Since `mid` is derived from `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 (because `n // 2` must be at least 1).

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `mid` must be at least 1 (which implies `n` must be at least 2)**
