Reasoning:
- The function correctly initializes a list `nums` with the first 24 powers of 2 (`2^0` to `2^23`).
- It then determines the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and removes that power of 2 from `nums`.
- It also appends `k - (1 << idx)`, `k + 1`, and `k + (1 << idx) + 1` to `nums`, ensuring that certain sums are not possible (specifically, `k` itself) and that all sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed.
- This approach ensures that no subsequence of `nums` sums to `k`, and every integer from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.
- The function then prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the function, the function appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
