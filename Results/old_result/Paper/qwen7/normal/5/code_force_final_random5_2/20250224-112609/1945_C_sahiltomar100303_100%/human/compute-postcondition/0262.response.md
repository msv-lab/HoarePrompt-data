Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is `mid + 1`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is either equal to `trightZero - 1` or remains the same, and `trightOne` is either equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2 - 1` or remains the same.**

Explanation: The variable `right` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `mid` to `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
