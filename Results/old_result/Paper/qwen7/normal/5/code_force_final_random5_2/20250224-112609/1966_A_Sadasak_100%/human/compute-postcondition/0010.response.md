Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers starting from the second element, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `frequency_table` is a dictionary, and if `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1.**
