Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character (minus the first character), `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 2 or 4 depending on whether the character `i` was not '*' before or was '*', respectively.**

Explanation: The code `thorn += 1` increments the value of `thorn` by 1. Given that `thorn` was either 1 or 3 initially, it will now be either 2 or 4, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
