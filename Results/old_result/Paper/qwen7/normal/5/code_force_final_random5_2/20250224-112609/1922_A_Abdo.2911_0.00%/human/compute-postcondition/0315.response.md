Postcondition: `match_c` is either `True` or `False`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), then `match_c` is set to `False` and `i` is 1, indicating that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` equals `template[i]` (ignoring case), then `match_c` remains unchanged and `i` is incremented such that it is still less than `n`. If `c[i].lower() != template[i].lower()`, `match_c` remains `False` and the loop or if statement continues.
