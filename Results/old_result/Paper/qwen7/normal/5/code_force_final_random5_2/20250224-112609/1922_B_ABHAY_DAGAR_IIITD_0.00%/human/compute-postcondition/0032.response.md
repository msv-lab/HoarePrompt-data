Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one value, and if the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If the condition `cnt >= 2` is not met, `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. However, the initial condition that if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` is not relevant here because the code does not include the term `(cnt - 2) // 6`. The value of `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, and the value of `cnt` and `total_count` are used in the calculation to update `res`.
