Reasoning:

1. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not.
2. However, the logic within the nested loop is flawed. Specifically, the program sets `l` to 'YES' as soon as it finds a character in `a` and `b` that does not match the corresponding character in `c`. This is incorrect because the program should only set `l` to 'YES' if both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not.
3. The current implementation will incorrectly print 'YES' if any character in `a` or `b` does not match the corresponding character in `c`, which is not the intended behavior.
4. Additionally, the program should check the entire length of the strings before concluding that a template exists or not.

Given these points, the program is not correctly implemented to solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
