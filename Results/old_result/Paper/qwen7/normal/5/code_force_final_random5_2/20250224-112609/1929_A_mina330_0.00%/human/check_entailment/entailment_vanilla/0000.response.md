### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - For example, for an array `[a1, a2, ..., an]`, the beauty is calculated as `(a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - an-1)`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It calculates the beauty by pairing the smallest and largest elements and summing their differences.
     - Specifically, it pairs `a[i]` with `a[n-i-1]` for `i` from `0` to `len(a)//2 - 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are paired together.
   - By pairing the smallest element with the largest, the next smallest with the next largest, etc., we ensure that the differences are maximized.
   - This approach works because the difference between the largest and smallest elements is the most significant, and subsequent smaller differences contribute positively to the overall sum.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has an even number of elements, the solution correctly pairs them.
   - If the array has an odd number of elements, the middle element is not used in the summation, but this does not affect the correctness since the middle element would have been paired with itself if included, contributing zero to the sum.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement confirm that the solution works for various scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and then pairing the smallest and largest elements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
