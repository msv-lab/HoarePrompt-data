Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer within the range [1, 10^4], and `k` is an integer within the range [1, 10^9]. The function returns a list `nums` where the first element is `nums[0] + k`, and all other elements `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) are equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, with `k` being less than or equal to 0.**
