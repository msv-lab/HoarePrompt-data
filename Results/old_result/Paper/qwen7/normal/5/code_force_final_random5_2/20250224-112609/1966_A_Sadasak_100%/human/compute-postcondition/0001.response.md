Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `num`, which iterates over the elements of the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: Since the loop starts with the first element of `arr`, `num` should be set to the first element of the list.

3. **Determine the state of `arr`**: The list `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards. For the loop to start, `arr` must contain at least one element.

4. **Determine the state of `frequency_table`**: The `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary. This state does not change based on the loop head, so it remains as an empty dictionary.

Given these points, we can summarize the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute:

- `arr` must contain at least one element.
- `num` must be set to the first element of `arr`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**.
