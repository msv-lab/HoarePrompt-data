Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than 0. If the condition `foundb and founds` is true, `b` and `s` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` and `s`.**
