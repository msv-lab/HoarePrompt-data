Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        
        print(dx * dx)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a 4x4 matrix of integers entered by the user for each iteration, `x` is a list of the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a` for each iteration, and `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x` for each iteration. The final output will be the result of `dx * dx` printed for each of the `t` iterations, concatenated together if `t` is greater than 1.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will consist of `t` lines, each line displaying the result of `dx * dx` for that particular iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple sets of coordinates from the user, where each set represents the corners of a square. For each set, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, squares this difference, and prints the result. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated results for each set of coordinates.
