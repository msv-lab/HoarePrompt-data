Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `cur` will be the highest number in the list `N`. The dictionary `M` will contain each unique number from `N` as a key, with the corresponding value being the count of how many times that number appears in `N`. The list `cnt` will contain all the unique numbers from `N`, repeated according to their occurrences in `M`. The variable `T` will be decremented by the length of `N` (i.e., `T -= len(N)`). The list `N` will be empty since it is modified during each iteration to progress through its elements.

In natural language, after the loop completes, `cur` will hold the maximum value from the original list `N`, `M` will map each distinct number in `N` to its frequency, `cnt` will list all unique numbers from `N` with their respective frequencies, `T` will be reduced by the number of elements in `N`, and `N` itself will be exhausted.
