Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is False, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by the element `arr[1]`.**

The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `ans`, which does not affect the values of `i`, `m`, or `nums`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
