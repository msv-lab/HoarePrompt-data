Output State: **The function is defined but no value is returned or assigned to any variable. The variable `x` remains an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.**

The code provided is a docstring for a function that aims to find the value of `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`. However, the function body is missing, so no actual computation or assignment is performed. The initial state of `x` remains unchanged.
