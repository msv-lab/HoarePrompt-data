Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `w` by splitting the input string using spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
