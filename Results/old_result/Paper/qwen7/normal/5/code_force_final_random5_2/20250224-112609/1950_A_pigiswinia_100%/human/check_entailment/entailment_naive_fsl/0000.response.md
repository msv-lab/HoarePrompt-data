Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal. According to the problem description, if `a = b = c`, the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation will incorrectly classify such cases as either "STAIR" or "PEAK" depending on the order of comparison. For example:

- If `a = b = c = 5`, the program will output "PEAK" because `a < b > c` evaluates to `5 < 5 > 5`, which is false, but the program does not handle this edge case correctly.

To fix this, the program needs to include a check for the case where `a == b == c` and output "NONE" in such cases. Here is an updated version of the function that includes this check:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This updated version ensures that all potential cases are handled correctly according to the problem description.
