You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    1 2 2 1
    
    6 1

    6 2
    
    5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

Output

    2 1
    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \) and \( k \), and an array \( a \) of length \( 2n \) where each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly twice. For each test case, it identifies and prints up to \( k \) pairs of identical elements from the array \( a \). If there are not enough pairs to form \( k \) pairs, it prints as many pairs as possible. After processing, it prints the remaining elements that were part of pairs but not fully printed due to the stopping conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the required arrays `l` and `r` for all potential cases. Specifically, the program logic for constructing the arrays `l` and `r` is flawed. Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
2
4 2
1 2 3 4 3 4 1 2
6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```

For the first test case, the program attempts to construct `l` and `r` as follows:
- It tries to take pairs from `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[3, 4, 1, 2]`.
- However, it incorrectly constructs `l` and `r` by only considering elements that appear twice in the first half and then filling the rest of `l` with elements that appear once in the first half, which does not guarantee that the XOR of `l` will match the XOR of `r`.

For the second test case, the program similarly fails to ensure that the XOR of `l` matches the XOR of `r`. The program logic does not properly handle the requirement to balance the XOR values across `l` and `r`.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to ensure that the XOR values of the selected elements in `l` and `r` match. This requires a more sophisticated approach, such as using a balanced selection strategy to ensure the XOR values align correctly.
