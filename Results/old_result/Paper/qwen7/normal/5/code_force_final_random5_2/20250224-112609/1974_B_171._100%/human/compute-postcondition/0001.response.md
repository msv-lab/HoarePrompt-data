Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted alphabetically; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. This dictionary does not affect the existing values of `encoded` or `unique_chars`, so their states remain unchanged. The only new variable created is `char_map`, which is initialized as an empty dictionary.
