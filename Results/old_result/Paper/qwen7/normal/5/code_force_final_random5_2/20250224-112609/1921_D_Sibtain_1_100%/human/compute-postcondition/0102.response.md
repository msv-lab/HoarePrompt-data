Output State: **`k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`**.

The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]` to `t2`. The values of `k` and `t1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
