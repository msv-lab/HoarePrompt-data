Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    template = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            template.append(a[i])
        else:
            template.append(a[i].upper())
    match_a_b = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                match_a_b = False
                break
        elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
            ].lower():
            match_a_b = False
            break
    match_c = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if c[i] != template[i]:
                match_c = False
                break
        elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
            match_c = False
            break
    if match_a_b and not match_c:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: match_a_b is True, and match_c is either True or False based on the comparison of characters in `c` and `template` throughout the entire loop. If the condition `match_a_b and (not match_c)` is true, then match_c remains False. Otherwise, match_c becomes True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `match_c` is True, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. Regardless of whether `match_a_b` is True or False, `match_c` remains True, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `match_c` is either True or False, `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than 0, and either (match_a_b is True and `match_c` is True) or (match_a_b is False).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
