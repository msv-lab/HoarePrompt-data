Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `b`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= n, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The line `b_freq = Counter(b)` creates a `Counter` object named `b_freq` which counts the frequency of each element in the list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
