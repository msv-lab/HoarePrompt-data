Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the string `s` by spaces and converting the first part to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from splitting the string `s` by spaces and converting the second part to an integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then either `n` equals `k` or `n` does not equal `k`. If `k` is less than 2, then the original values of `n` and `k` are retained.
