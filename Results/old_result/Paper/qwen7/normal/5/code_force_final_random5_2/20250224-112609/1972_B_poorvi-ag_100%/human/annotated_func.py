#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is 99, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input from the user for the last iteration, `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no', and every element in `results` is assigned to `i` in sequence during each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list exactly once. Since there are 100 elements in `results`, the loop will execute 100 times. During each iteration, the current element of `results` is printed, and then it is assigned to the variable `i`. After all iterations, `i` will take on the value of the last element in the `results` list, which is the 100th element. However, the state of `results` itself remains unchanged; it still contains its original 100 elements, with each element being either 'yes' or 'no' based on the count of 'U' in the corresponding input string from the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting of "U" and "D". It checks if the count of "U" in the string \( s \) is odd. If the count is odd, it appends "yes" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "no". After processing all test cases, it prints the results list, which contains 100 elements, each being either "yes" or "no".
