Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to generate a sequence of integers based on the input `number`.
   - The function handles the base case where `number` is 0 by returning two zeros.
   - For non-zero `number`, it calculates a pair of values (`size` and `i`) using bitwise operations and a loop.
   - It then appends a series of integers to the `sequence` list based on these values.
   - The function recursively calls itself with a modified `number` until `number` becomes 0.

2. **Recursive Calls**:
   - The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)` ensures that the total number of increasing subsequences matches the required `X`.
   - This recursive approach guarantees that the generated sequence meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - After the recursive calls, the `sequence` list is printed along with its length.
   - The sequence is constructed such that it satisfies the condition of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `number` is 0 by returning two zeros, which results in an empty sequence.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length is at most 200, as required by the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to generate a sequence with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The recursive approach ensures that the sequence meets the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
