Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a valid integer (we don't know its exact value, but it must be an integer).
   - `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `first_row` and the second element is the input from the user.
   - `first_row` is equal to `first_row + a[-1][0]`.
   - `last_row` is equal to the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a` plus `a[-1][-1]`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a valid integer.

5. **Update the state of `first_row` and `last_row`**:
   - Since the loop body is omitted, no changes are made to `first_row` and `last_row` within the loop itself. Therefore, their values remain the same.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` is still a valid integer.
   - `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `first_row` and the second element is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to `first_row + a[-1][0]`, `last_row` is equal to the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a` plus `a[-1][-1]`**.
