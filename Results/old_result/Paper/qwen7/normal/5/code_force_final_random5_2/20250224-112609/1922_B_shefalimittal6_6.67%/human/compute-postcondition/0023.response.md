Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop iterates over `cnt` which is a value from `num_of_lens.values()`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more values in `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary.
   - `cnt` is a value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `res` is updated based on the value of `cnt` and `total_sum`.
   - `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `cnt` is a value from `num_of_lens.values()`, it will be the next value in the iteration.
   - `num_of_lens` remains the same dictionary, but `cnt` will be the next value in the sequence.
   - `total_sum` will be recalculated excluding the new `cnt`.

Given these points, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- `num_of_lens` remains the same.
- `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `total_sum` will be recalculated excluding the new `cnt`.

Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary and `cnt` is a value from this dictionary, the key associated with `cnt` will change in the next iteration. However, the dictionary itself does not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next value of `cnt` being processed and the updated `total_sum`.

**State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus the combination of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by `total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.**
