Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is 0, `max` is 99999899, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing 99999999, -99999998**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Since `min` is -99999998, the list `ans` now contains two elements: 99999999 (previously) and -99999998. All other variables remain unchanged.
