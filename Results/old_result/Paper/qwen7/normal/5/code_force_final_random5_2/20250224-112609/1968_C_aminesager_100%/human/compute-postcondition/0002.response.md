Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making it a positive integer within the range of 0 to \(10^4 - 1\). The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
