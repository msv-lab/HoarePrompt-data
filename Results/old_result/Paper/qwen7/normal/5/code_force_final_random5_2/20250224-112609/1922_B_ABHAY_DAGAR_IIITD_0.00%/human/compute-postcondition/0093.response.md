Output State: **`res` is `2 * res`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `cnt`, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Given the initial state of `res` as `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, the new value of `res` becomes `2 * (cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
