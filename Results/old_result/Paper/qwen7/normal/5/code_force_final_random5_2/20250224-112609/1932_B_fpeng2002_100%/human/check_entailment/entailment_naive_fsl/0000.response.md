Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. According to the problem description, the tribe waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the previous one. However, the current implementation calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities, which does not necessarily give the correct result.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```
The correct sequence of years would be:
- First sign in year 3
- Second sign in year 4 (after the first)
- Third sign in year 8 (after the second)
- Fourth sign in year 10 (after the third)
- Fifth sign in year 18 (after the fourth)
- Sixth sign in year 36 (after the fifth)

However, the program calculates the LCM of 3, 2, 4, 5, 9, and 18, which is 180. This is incorrect because it does not follow the sequential waiting period as described in the problem.

To fix this, the program needs to iteratively calculate the next year for each sign based on the previous one, rather than finding the LCM of all periodicities at once.
