Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is between 0 and the total number of '0's from `mid` to the end of the string `s`, inclusive, `leftOne` is between 0 and the total number of '1's from `mid` to the end of the string `s`, inclusive, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `right` is equal to `n`, `trightZero` is less than or equal to `rightZero`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `rightOne`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` hold true.**

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `left` remains 0, indicating no change in the position of `left`. The values of `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `leftMove`, `right`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged. Additionally, the conditions `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` continue to hold true, ensuring that the balance of '0's and '1's on either side of the current split point is maintained as required.
