You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer, and sequence is a list of integers where all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers where all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9], and number is not equal to 0
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `number` must be at least 255; `size` is 8.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. After each iteration, `size` increases by 1. Given that after 3 iterations `number` must be at least 63 and `size` is 6, we can deduce the condition for the loop to continue. Each iteration effectively doubles the threshold value of `number` that needs to be met to continue the loop. Therefore, after 4 iterations, `number` must be at least \(127\) more than the previous threshold (63), making it at least \(127 + 63 = 190\). After 5 iterations, it must be at least \(127 + 190 = 317\), but since the next power of 2 minus 1 that fits within the given range is 255, `number` must be at least 255 for the loop to continue. After 6 iterations, `size` would be 8, and the loop would terminate because the condition `(1 << 8 + 1) - 1 > number` would no longer be satisfied with `number` being 255.
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `number` must be at least 255, `i` is 8, `size` is 8, `sequence` contains `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
    #
    #Explanation: After 6 iterations, the loop condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` is no longer satisfied when `number` is 255, so the loop terminates. At this point, `i` will be 8 because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < size`, and `size` is 8. The `sequence` list will contain the numbers from 0 to 7 because the loop appends each `i` to the list during its execution.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `number` is 255, `i` is 8, `size` is 8, `sequence` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - 1`, which is 7 iterations since `size` is 8. After the first 3 iterations, the sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]. Since `result` is 0 for all iterations, the expression `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` simplifies to `sequence[-0 - i - 1] += 0`, meaning it does not change any elements in the sequence for the remaining iterations. Therefore, the sequence remains unchanged after all iterations, and the final state matches the state after the third iteration.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 8, and the result is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer, and `sequence`, a list of integers where all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. It returns 0 in Case_1 and 8 in Case_2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns 8, and the result is 0.
