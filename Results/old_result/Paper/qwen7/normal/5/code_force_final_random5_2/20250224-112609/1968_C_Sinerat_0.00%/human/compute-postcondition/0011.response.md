Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to 10,000, `n` is still greater than 1, `x` remains as the original list of integers, and `a` is a list of `n` integers starting with 500 at index 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `x`.
