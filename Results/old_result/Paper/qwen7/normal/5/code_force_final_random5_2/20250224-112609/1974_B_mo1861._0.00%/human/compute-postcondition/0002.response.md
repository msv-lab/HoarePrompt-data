Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`.
   - The variables involved are `i`, `c`, and the iterable `sorted(set(b))`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will iterate over each unique character in the sorted form of the string `b`.
   - `i` is the index of the current character in the sorted unique characters list.
   - `c` is the current character from the sorted unique characters list.

3. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
   - `char_map` is an empty dictionary.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `b` is a string, we don't need to adjust its state directly because the loop will modify the internal state of `b` through the iteration.
   - `char_map` is an empty dictionary, and it will be updated during the loop execution.
   - The initial state of `i` and `c` depends on the first iteration of the loop.

5. **Initial Values for `i` and `c`:**
   - For the first iteration, `i` will be 0.
   - `c` will be the first unique character in the sorted form of `b`.

6. **Final State Before the First Iteration:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start, which means `b` must have at least one unique character.
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `c` should be the first unique character in the sorted form of `b`.

Given this analysis, the state before the first execution of the loop should be:

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, and `c` is the first unique character in the sorted form of `b`.**
