Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is now `k - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`, `a` is sorted in descending order, `f` is decreased by 1, `x` is now the element at index `f` in list `a`.**

This means that the value of `x` is updated to be the element at the new index `f` in the list `a`, which is now sorted in descending order. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
