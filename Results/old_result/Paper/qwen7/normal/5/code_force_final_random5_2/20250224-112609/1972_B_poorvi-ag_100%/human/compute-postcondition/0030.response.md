Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `results`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `results` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no'.
   - The second element of `results` is assigned to `i`.

4. **Next iteration**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the second element in `results`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` will take the value of the next element in the list `results`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `results` will now be the same list but without the first element (since `i` took the value of the second element).
   - `i` will be the value of the third element in the original list `results`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`results` is a list containing 99 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no', and the second element of `results` is the third element from the original list**.
