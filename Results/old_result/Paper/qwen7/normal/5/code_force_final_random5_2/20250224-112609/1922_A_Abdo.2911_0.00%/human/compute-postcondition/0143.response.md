Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is not lowercase. Additionally, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches the character at index `i` in `template` when converted to lowercase. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
