Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `list[i] > 1` and `list[i - 1] > 0` and `list[i + 1] > 0`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `list[i - 1]` is now `0`.
   - The conditions `list[i] > -1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 1` still hold for the rest of the list.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition involves `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]`.
   - Since `list[i - 1]` is now `0`, it no longer satisfies the condition `list[i - 1] > 0`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `list[i - 1]` to be greater than `0` for the loop to continue.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that `list[i - 1]` is greater than `0` for the loop to execute one more time.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0**
