Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Rearrange the permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search finds `x` at position `l` after the search.
2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - Initialize `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
   - While `r - l > 1`, compute `m = (l + r) // 2`.
   - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`.
   - Otherwise, set `r = m`.

### Provided Code Analysis
1. **Functions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a space-separated line and returns it as a map object.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list.
   - `func_3()`: Implements the main logic.

2. **Main Logic in `func_3()`**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - Reads the permutation `arr`.
   - Finds the position `pos` of `k` in `arr`.
   - Initializes `st` as an empty set.
   - Performs a binary search-like operation to find the correct position `low` where `arr[low]` should be `k`.
   - If `arr[low] == k`, prints `0` indicating no swaps needed.
   - Otherwise, prints `1` and performs one swap between `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues with the Provided Code
1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The code attempts to perform a binary search but does not correctly simulate the binary search process. Specifically, the binary search is not used to find the correct position of `k` in the permutation.
   - The code instead uses a set `st` to store mid-values, which is unnecessary and does not contribute to finding the correct position of `k`.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The code assumes that one swap is enough to place `k` at the correct position, which is not necessarily true. The problem statement guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, but the current implementation only handles one swap.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The code outputs `0` if no swaps are needed, `1` if one swap is needed, but it does not handle the case where two swaps are needed. This violates the requirement to output the number of operations and the positions of the swaps.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that:
- We find the correct positions for `k` using a proper binary search.
- We handle both one and two swaps to place `k` at the correct position.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic and does not handle the problem as specified. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
