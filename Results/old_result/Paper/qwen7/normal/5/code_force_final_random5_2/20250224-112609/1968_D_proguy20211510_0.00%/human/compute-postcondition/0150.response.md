Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input itself, which is used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions given are:
   - `maxs` is the maximum value of `ptss`.
   - `maxb` is the maximum value of `ptsb`.
   - `i` is `len(pres) - 1`.
   - `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`.
   - `ptsb` contains the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`.
   - `ptss` contains the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the input value for the next iteration. Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the input value determines how many times the loop will run.

4. **Formulate the New State**: After the current iteration, the input value will be taken as the number of remaining iterations. Therefore, the new state should reflect the updated input value and the unchanged other variables.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- The input value (which controls the loop) will be decremented by 1 since one iteration has already occurred.
- All other variables (`maxs`, `maxb`, `i`, `rem`, `ptsb`, `ptss`) remain unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`maxs` is the maximum value of `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value of `ptsb`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `ptsb` contains the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` contains the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`, and the input value for the next iteration is `int(input()) - 1`**.
