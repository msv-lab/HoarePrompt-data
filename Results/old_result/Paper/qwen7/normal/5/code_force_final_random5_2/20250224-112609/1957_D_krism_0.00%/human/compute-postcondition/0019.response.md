Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` since the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 31 (inclusive).

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `pre[i][0]` is 1

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 32.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop will continue if `i < 32`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, which is less than 32, the loop will continue.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `pre[i][0]` will be `pre[2][0]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2; `pre[i][0]` is `pre[2][0]`**
