Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`; `mean` is `total` // `n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the mean of the list `nums` by performing integer division (`//`) of `total` by `n`. Since `total` is equal to the sum of `nums` and `n` is the length of `nums`, the value of `mean` is the integer division of the sum of `nums` by its length. The conditions about `total` and `n` remain unchanged.
