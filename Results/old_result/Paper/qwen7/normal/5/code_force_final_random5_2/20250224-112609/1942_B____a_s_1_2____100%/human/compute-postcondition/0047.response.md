Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `mex` is the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the value of `p[i]` to be `mex - a[i]`. This does not affect the values of `i` and `mex`. Therefore, the values of `i` and `mex` remain unchanged. The value of `p[i]` is now updated to `mex - a[i]`.
