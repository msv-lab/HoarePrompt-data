Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1 divided by 2, `max` is 99999996, `min` is -99990000, `ans` is a list containing 99999997, and `t` is 2.**

Explanation: The code divides the value of `x` by 2 using integer division (`//`). Since `x` is an input integer greater than 1, after the operation, `x` becomes an integer greater than 0.5 but less than or equal to 1 (since it was originally greater than 1 and now halved). All other variables remain unchanged.
