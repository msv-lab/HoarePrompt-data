Output State: **`nums[0]` is now `nums[0] + k`, `nums` is a list where the first element is `nums[0] + k`, and all other elements `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) are equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and `k` is less than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `nums[0] += k` increments the first element of the list `nums` by the value of `k`. Since `k` is less than or equal to 0, the subsequent elements of `nums` remain unchanged as they are set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, which will be 0 because `nums[0] + 1` is positive and `k` is non-positive.
