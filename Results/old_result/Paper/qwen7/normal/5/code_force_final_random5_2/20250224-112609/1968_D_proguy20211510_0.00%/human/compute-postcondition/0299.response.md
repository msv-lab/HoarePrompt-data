Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` is the input integer, `pb` is the input integer, `ps` is the input integer, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged from their initial state.
