Output State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list, `thorn` is 0, `ret` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `ret += 1` increments the value of `ret` by 1. Since `ret` was initially 0, after executing this line, `ret` becomes 1. The other variables (`s`, `i`, and `thorn`) remain unchanged.
