Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the key `num` and its value set to `k`.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. Since `frequency_table[num]` was originally greater than `k`, it is now set to `k`. The other variables (`arr` and `num`) remain unchanged.
