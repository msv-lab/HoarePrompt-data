Postcondition: `re` is 0, `ul` is either 2 * `k` or a multiple of 4 up to 4 * `k`, `ur` is 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `res` is an empty list, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `a[i]` being 2 during the loop's iterations for `i` in the range `[n, n-1]`, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, and `k` is non-zero.
