Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function returns 'YES' under specific conditions and 'NO' otherwise.**

Given the constraints and the output cases, it seems the function checks for certain conditions within the password but does not specify what those conditions are. Since all cases except one return 'NO', the only condition that returns 'YES' is not explicitly stated in the given information.
