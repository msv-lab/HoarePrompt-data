You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set contains an integer `n` indicating the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of `a`. For each set, it calls another function `func_1` to process the array and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, separated by new lines.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - `func_1` checks if the array is already non-decreasing.
   - `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - If all elements satisfy `arr[i] <= arr[i + 1]`, it returns 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it returns 'No' if there's at least one pair where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`.
   - This function does not handle the splitting and swapping operation; it only checks if the array is already sorted.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It uses `func_1` to determine if each test case's array can be sorted by the described operation.
   - The logic in `func_2` seems correct for reading and processing multiple test cases.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The problem requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.
   - `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient.
   - The problem description suggests that the array might need to be split and swapped, but `func_1` does not implement this logic.

### Conclusion:
- `func_1` is incorrect because it only checks if the array is already sorted, not if it can be made sorted by splitting and swapping.
- `func_2` is also incorrect because it relies on `func_1`, which is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
