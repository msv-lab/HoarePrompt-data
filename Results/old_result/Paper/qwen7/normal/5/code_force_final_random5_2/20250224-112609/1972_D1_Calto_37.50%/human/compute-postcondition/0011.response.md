Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; `i` is `m`; `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`, `y` is `i * i`, `cnt` is the same as the previous value; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**

Explanation: 
- The code `y = i * i` assigns the value of `i * i` to `y`. Since `i` is equal to `m`, `y` is now `m * m`.
- The values of `m`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `cnt` are updated accordingly, but the condition that `m` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
- Additionally, the value of `x` is also updated to `n - (i * i - i)`, which simplifies to `n - (m * m - m)` since `i` is `m`.
