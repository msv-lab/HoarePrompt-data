Output State: **`tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `trightZero = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `trightZero`. This does not affect any other variables. The initial conditions for `tleftZero`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged.
