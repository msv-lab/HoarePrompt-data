State: **`max_score` is 0, `num` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `num` and `n`.
2. The loop starts with `num` initialized to 1 and increments `num` in each iteration.
3. The condition for the loop to continue is `1 <= num <= n`.
4. For the loop to start executing, `n` must be greater than 0 because if `n` is 0 or less, the condition `1 <= num <= n` will never be true.
5. Initially, `max_score` is set to 0, but this does not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 0 and `num` starts at 1.
