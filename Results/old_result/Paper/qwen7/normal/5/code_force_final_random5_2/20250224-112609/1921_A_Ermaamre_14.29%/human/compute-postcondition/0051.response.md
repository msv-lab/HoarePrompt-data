Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is the first integer from the input, `y1` is the second integer from the input, `x2` is the second integer from the input, `y2` is the second integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y3` is the second integer from the input split by space, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` to `res`. Since `y1` and `y3` are integers from the input, `res` will be the absolute difference between these two values. The other variables remain unchanged.
