Postcondition: `h1` is either '10', '11', or '12', `m1` is `m`, `time` is either 'PM', 'PM', or an empty string, `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 1`.
