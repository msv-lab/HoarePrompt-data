Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either a lowercase letter, in which case the loop or statement we were inside is broken out if either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or the character at index `i` in `template` is not a lowercase letter, in which case either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches the character at index `i` in `template` when converted to lowercase, and the loop or statement we were inside is also broken out.
