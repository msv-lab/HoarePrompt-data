Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a new input string.
- `a` is the first integer from the new input string `s`.
- `b` is the second integer from the new input string `s` converted to an integer.
- `t` must be at least 1 (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `i` is `i + 2` (though its value is also not relevant to the print statement).

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement will print the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **'Bob'**
