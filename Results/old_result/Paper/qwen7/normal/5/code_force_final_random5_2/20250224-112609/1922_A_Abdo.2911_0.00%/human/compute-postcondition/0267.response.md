Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True or False based on the comparison of elements at index `i` in arrays `a` and `b` with those in `template`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If the condition is not met, `match_a_b` remains unchanged, and the same conditions apply. We either break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
