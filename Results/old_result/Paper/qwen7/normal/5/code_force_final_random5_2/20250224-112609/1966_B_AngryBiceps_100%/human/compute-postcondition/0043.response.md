Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `last_row` is now the concatenation of its original value and the last character of the newly added element in the list `a`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list containing one more element than before, which is the input from the user.
   - `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the original element and the first character of the new element in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `n` must remain as it is (an input integer), but it must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.
   - `last_row` will be updated based on the new element in the list `a`.
   - `first_row` will be updated based on the new element in the list `a`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. The other states (`last_row`, `a`, `first_row`) will be updated within the loop body, but they are not part of the loop head.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1**
