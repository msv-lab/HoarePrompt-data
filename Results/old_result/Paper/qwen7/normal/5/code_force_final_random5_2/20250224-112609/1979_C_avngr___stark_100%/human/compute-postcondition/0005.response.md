Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for num in numbers[1:]`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the Iteration Context**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements.
   - `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, where `num` is the third element of `numbers`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Conditions**:
   - For the loop to continue, `numbers` must still have at least 3 elements.
   - In the next iteration, `num` will be the fourth element of `numbers` (since it starts from the second element).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `numbers` must still have at least 3 elements, this condition remains unchanged.
   - `result` will be updated based on the function call `func_1(result, num)` where `num` is now the fourth element of `numbers`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, and `num` is the fourth element of `numbers`.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, and `num` is the fourth element of `numbers`**.
