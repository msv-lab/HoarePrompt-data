Output State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is either 8 or 4 * `k`, `ur` is 0, `i` is `2 * n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `res` is an empty list, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `a[i]` being 2 during the loop's iterations for `i` in the range `[n, n-1]`, and if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ul` is increased by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop or block it was placed in. Therefore, the values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `i`, `a`, `res`, and `l` remain unchanged. We only note that the execution breaks out of the loop or if statement it was inside.
