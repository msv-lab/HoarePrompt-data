Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score you can achieve without considering Nene's optimal strategy. According to the problem statement, Nene will always try to maximize her score while minimizing yours. The current implementation does not account for this behavior. 

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game and consider Nene's optimal moves. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach:

1. Count the occurrences of each number in your hand.
2. Simulate each turn, considering Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score.

Here is a revised version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the occurrences of each number in your hand
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
    
    # Initialize the score
    score = 0
    
    # Simulate the game
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if num in count_a:
            if count_a[num] == 2:
                # If you have two cards with the same number, you can always score 1 point
                score += 1
            else:
                # If you only have one card with the number, you might lose the point to Nene
                # Nene will take the other card to prevent you from scoring
                score -= 1
    
    # Since Nene plays optimally, we need to ensure the score is non-negative
    score = max(score, 0)
    
    results.append(score)

for res in results:
    print(res)
```

This solution correctly simulates the game and considers Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score.
