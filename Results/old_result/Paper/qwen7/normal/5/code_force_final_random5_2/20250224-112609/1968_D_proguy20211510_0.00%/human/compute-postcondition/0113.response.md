Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `sb` is `sb + b[k] + b[i - 1]`, `pres` is `[pres[0], ss + s[i]]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[i - 1]]`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is `k + 1`.
- After executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes `k + 2`.
- The line `pres.append(ss + s[i])` appends the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. Since `i` is now `k + 2`, `pres` becomes `[pres[0], ss + s[k + 2]]`.
- `sb` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
- `ss` is updated by adding `s[i]` (which is `s[k + 2]`) to its current value.
- `preb` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
