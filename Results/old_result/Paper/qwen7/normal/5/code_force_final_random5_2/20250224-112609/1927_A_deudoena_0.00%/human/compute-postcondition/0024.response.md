Output State: **`i` is less than `len(inpstr)`, and `ind2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or condition where `i` is being checked against `len(inpstr)`. The values of `i` and `ind2` remain unchanged, but the program now breaks out of the loop or condition.
