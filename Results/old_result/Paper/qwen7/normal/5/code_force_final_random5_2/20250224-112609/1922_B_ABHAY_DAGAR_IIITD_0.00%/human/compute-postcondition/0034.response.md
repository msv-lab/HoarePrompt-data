Postcondition: `num_of_lens` must have at least one value, and if the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `res` is increased by either `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` or `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, depending on whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. If the condition `cnt >= 2` is not met, `res` remains unchanged.
