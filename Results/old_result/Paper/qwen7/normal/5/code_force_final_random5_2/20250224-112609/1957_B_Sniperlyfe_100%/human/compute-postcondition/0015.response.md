Output State: **`i` is 3; `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` to `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the value of `nums[i]` is now `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid, though no direct action was taken on `n` in the given code snippet.
