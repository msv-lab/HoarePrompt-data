Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * max(t1, t2)`, `i` is either 1, 2, or 3, `j` is 4, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 3] - c[len(c) - 3])`**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
