Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 1`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `idx = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `idx`. This changes the value of `idx` from `23` to `0`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
