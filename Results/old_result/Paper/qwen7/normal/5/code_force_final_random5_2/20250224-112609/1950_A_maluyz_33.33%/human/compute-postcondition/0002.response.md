Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 1000, and `i` remains 0.
