Output State: **`i` is 2; `pre[i][0]` is 3**

Explanation: The code `pre[i][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[i][0]` by 1. Given that `i` is 2, `pre[i][0]` which was initially `pre[2][0]` is now `pre[2][0] + 1`. Since `pre[2][0]` was not specified in the initial state, we denote its new value as 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
