Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly handle the decrement operations as specified in the problem description. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
5 6 0 2 3
```

According to the problem description, the operations can only be applied to indices `i` where `2 <= i <= n-1`. However, the current implementation of `func_2` attempts to apply operations even when `list[i]` is already zero, which is not allowed. This leads to incorrect behavior.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:
- The function `func_2` iterates through the array and tries to apply operations even when `list[i]` is zero, which violates the rules.
- It also does not properly handle the case where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros due to the constraints of the operations.

To fix this, the function should ensure that operations are only applied to valid indices and should correctly handle the state of the array during the process.
