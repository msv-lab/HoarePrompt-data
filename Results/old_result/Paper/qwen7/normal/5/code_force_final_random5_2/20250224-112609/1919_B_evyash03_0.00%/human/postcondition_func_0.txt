The function accepts a string `expression` consisting of characters "+" and "-" and an integer `length` representing the length of `expression`. It counts the number of times the balance (initially set to 0) is reset to 0 because it becomes negative during the iteration of `expression`. Additionally, it adds 1 to the count if the final balance is greater than 0. The function returns this total count.
