Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the integer obtained from the first part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.
- `k` is the integer obtained from the second part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then either `n` equals `k` or `n` does not equal `k`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over each line of input starting from the second line (since `[1:]` is applied to the list of lines read from the standard input).
- Each `s` is a string containing space-separated values.
- `n` and `k` are derived from `s` by splitting it into parts and converting them to integers.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `s`.
2. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, there must be another line of input available to process.

### New State
- Since `s` is derived from the input line, the new `s` will be the next line of input.
- Therefore, `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` and `k` will be derived from the new `s`.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first part of the next line of input split by spaces and converted to an integer, `k` is the integer obtained from the second part of the next line of input split by spaces and converted to an integer**.
