The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of this string, denoted as `n`, satisfies the condition 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns a string `decoded`, which is the result of replacing each character in the `encoded` string using specific mappings defined in `char_map`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a decoded string `decoded` by replacing each character in `encoded` according to predefined mappings in `char_map`.**
