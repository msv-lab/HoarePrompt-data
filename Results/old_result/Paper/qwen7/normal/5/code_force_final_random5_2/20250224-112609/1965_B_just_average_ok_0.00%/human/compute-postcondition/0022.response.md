Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 1`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]` creates a new list `nums` containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). The element \(1 << idx\) (which is \(1 << 23\)) was previously removed from the list, but now it is re-added as part of the new list generated by the comprehension. The other variables (`idx`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and the condition about `k + nums[idx] + 1` being in the list) remain unchanged.
