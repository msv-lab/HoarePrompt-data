Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to the final value obtained by successively updating `last_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and `results` contains a single element which is a string representation of `next_year`.**

Explanation:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is now equal to `n`.
- The value of `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, which is the result of applying the loop's operation iteratively from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`.
- The `results` list now contains a single element, which is a string representation of `next_year`.
