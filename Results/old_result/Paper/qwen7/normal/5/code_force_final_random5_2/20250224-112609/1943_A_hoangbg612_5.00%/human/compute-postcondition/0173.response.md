Output State: **`cur` is equal to `i`, and the value of M[i] is less than or equal to i and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly shown, the `break` statement implies that we are exiting the context where `cur` is equal to `i` and the condition `M[i] <= i` holds true. The values of `cur` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition about `M[i]` remains valid.
