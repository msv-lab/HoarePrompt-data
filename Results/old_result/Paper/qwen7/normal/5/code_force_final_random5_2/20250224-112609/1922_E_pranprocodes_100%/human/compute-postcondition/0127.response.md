Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 3, `x` is either 0 or 2, `max` is either decreased by 1 or remains unchanged, `min` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, and `ans` now contains either `max - 1` or `min + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Initially, `t` is 2, so after executing the code, `t` becomes 3. The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
