Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 2`
- `res` must contain elements (though the value of `res` itself is not relevant to the print statement)
- `ul` is equal to `ur`

The print statement is:

```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is `n + 2`, we need to know the value of `n` to determine the exact element. However, since `n` is not explicitly given, we can only express it in terms of `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the element at index `n + 2` in the list `a` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **a[n + 2] a[n + 2]**
