Output State: **`nums` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element from `nums`, `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to its current value**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `curr` by adding the difference between the current element `i` (which is the next element from `nums`) and the last value (`last`). The initial conditions of `nums` containing at least one element, `i` being the next element from `nums`, and `curr` being updated by adding `i - last` to its current value remain valid after the code execution. The specific values of `nums`, `i`, and `curr` are not provided, so they are described in terms of their relationships and conditions.
