Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a[2]` is equal to `a[1] + x[1]`

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 3 for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is now 3, `n` must still be greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` is adjusted to 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
