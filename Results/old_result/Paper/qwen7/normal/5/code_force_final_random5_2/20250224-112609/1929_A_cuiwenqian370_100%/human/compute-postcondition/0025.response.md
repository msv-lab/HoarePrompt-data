Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `index` is increased by `n`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**.

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(array)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1` called with `array` as its argument to the variable `result`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `index` is increased by `n` remains unchanged. The value of `array` is a list of integers starting at `index + n` and of length `n`, but since the function `func_1` is not specified, the exact value of `result` cannot be determined.
