Output State: **`num_of_lens` must not be empty, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` where each value is not equal to `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `num_of_lens` being non-empty, `res` being increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` where each value is not equal to `cnt`.
- The code snippet updates `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. This means `res` now has its original value plus the new addition.
- The value of `total_sum` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
- The condition for `res` (whether it was increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` or not) also remains the same since the code does not check the condition again.
- Therefore, the output state retains the non-empty nature of `num_of_lens`, the updated value of `res`, and the unchanged `total_sum`.
