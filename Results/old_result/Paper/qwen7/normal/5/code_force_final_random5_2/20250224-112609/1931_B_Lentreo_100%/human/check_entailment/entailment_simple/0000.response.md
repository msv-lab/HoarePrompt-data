Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water between them.
2. The key observation is that since the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, the average amount of water per container is an integer.
3. The provided solution calculates the average amount of water (`mean`) and checks if it's possible to balance the water such that each container ends up with this average amount.
4. The logic in `func_1`:
   - Computes the total amount of water and checks if it's divisible by `n`.
   - Initializes `curr` to 0 and iterates through each container, adjusting `curr` by the difference between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water to the mean, so it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means the water can be balanced, so it returns 'YES'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic in the provided code, the solution correctly determines whether it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
