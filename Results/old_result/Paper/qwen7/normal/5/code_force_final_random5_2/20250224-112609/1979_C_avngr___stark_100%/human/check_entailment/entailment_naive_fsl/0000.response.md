Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not relate to the task of distributing coins in a way that ensures coming out ahead for any winning outcome. 

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  3 2 7
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  27 41 12
  ```

However, running the provided functions with the input `[3, 2, 7]` using `func_2` would not produce the expected result. Instead, it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and is thus incorrect.
