Output State: **`last_digit_index` is 1, `password` must not be an empty string, `i` is 2, `char` is the first character of `password` and it is a digit.**

Explanation: The code sets `last_digit_index` to the current value of `i`, which is 1. After this assignment, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `password` and `char` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
