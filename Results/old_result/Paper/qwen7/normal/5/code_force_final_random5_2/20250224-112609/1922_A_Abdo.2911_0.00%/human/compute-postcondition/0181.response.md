Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is not lowercase. If the character at index `i` in `c` matches the character at the same index in `template` when both are converted to lowercase, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters do not match, the postcondition remains as initially described.
