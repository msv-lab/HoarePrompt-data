Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `a` is a list of integers equal to the numbers entered after the space**.

Explanation: The code `a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
