Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2()`: Reads and returns `n` and `x` for a single test case.
   - `func_3()`: Reads and returns the permutation `p` for a single test case.
   - `func_4()`: Returns the input provided by the user for the test case, which includes `n`, `x`, and `p`.
   - `func_5()`: Reads and returns a line of input split into a list of strings, which is not used in the provided code.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main logic is implemented within the loop that iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the position of `x` using a modified binary search approach.
   - The logic correctly handles the scenario where `x` is not initially at the correct position and performs up to 2 swaps to ensure `x` is at the correct position before performing the binary search.

3. **Binary Search Modification**:
   - The binary search is modified to ensure `p[left]` equals `x` after the search.
   - If `p[left]` is not `x`, it checks if `x` is missing from the seen list and performs a swap with the smallest missing index.
   - If `x` is still not found, it performs another swap to ensure `x` is at the correct position.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the number of swaps performed and the indices of the swaps.
   - The logic ensures that the number of swaps is always within the limit of 2.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required logic and meets the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
