Postcondition: **`reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are true, and `j` equals `n - 1`**.

This means that regardless of whether the if condition is met or not, the final state of the program ensures that both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are true, and `j` equals `n - 1`. Since there is no else part, the if condition directly leads to the specified postcondition.
