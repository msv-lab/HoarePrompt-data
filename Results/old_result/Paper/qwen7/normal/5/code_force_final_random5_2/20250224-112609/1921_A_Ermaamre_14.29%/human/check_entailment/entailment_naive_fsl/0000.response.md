Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all potential cases. Specifically, the program assumes that the sides of the square are aligned either horizontally or vertically based on the first pair of coordinates it encounters. However, this approach fails to consider squares that are rotated or have sides that are neither purely horizontal nor vertical.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
0 0
1 1
0 1
1 0
```

In this case, the square is rotated 45 degrees, and the program will incorrectly calculate the side length as 1 (the difference between x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent points), leading to an incorrect area of 1 instead of the correct area of 2.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to identify the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates among the four points and calculate the side length of the square as the difference between these values. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Find the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates
        min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        max_x = max(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        min_y = min(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        max_y = max(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = abs(max_x - min_x)
        
        # Print the area of the square
        print(side_length ** 2)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the side length of the square is calculated correctly regardless of the orientation of the square.
