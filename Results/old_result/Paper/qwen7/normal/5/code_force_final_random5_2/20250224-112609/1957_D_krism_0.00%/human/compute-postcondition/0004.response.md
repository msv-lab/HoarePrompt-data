Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for v in arr:`. This means the variables involved are `v` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `prefix` is a list containing `[0]`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `arr`. The variable `v` will take the value of each element in `arr` one by one during each iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `arr` having at least one element, `arr` must contain at least one element.
   - The variable `v` will be set to the first element of `arr` when the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must have at least one element.
- `v` will be set to the first element of `arr`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`prefix` is a list containing `[0]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `arr` must have at least one element, `v` is the first element of `arr`**.
