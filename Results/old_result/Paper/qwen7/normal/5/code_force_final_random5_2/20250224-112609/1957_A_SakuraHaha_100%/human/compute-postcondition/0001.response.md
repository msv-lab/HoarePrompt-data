Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
