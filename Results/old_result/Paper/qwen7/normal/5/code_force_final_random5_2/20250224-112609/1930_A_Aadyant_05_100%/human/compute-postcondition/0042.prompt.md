Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is 0, `num` is the previous value of `num` incremented by 1, `list1` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b`, `b` is an input string.
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a non-empty string, list1 is a list of strings obtained by splitting `b`, `list2` is a list with one element which is the integer representation of the first string in `list1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a non-empty string, list1 is a list of strings with one less element than before, list2 is a list with one element which is the integer representation of the first string in the updated list1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a non-empty string, `list1` is a list of strings with at least one element, `list2` is a list with two elements where the first element is the original single element and the second element is the integer representation of the next string in the updated `list1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
