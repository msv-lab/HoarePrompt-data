Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k` for each case.
3. The logic within the loop is correct:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, printing `1` means that Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands.
   - Otherwise, printing `n` means that Everule can still visit all islands, including island 1.
4. The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
