Output State: **`x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1; `n` is defined and non-zero; `ans` is 1; `l` is a list containing the values [1, i]; `i` is a variable that is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains the value 1. After executing `l.append(i)`, `l` will contain the values `[1, i]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
