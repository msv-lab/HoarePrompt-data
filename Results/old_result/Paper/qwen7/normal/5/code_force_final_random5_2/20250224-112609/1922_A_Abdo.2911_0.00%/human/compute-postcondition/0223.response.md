Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `template` is a list containing one element which is `a[i]`.upper(), and the elements `a[i]` and `b[i]` are not equal.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i].upper()` to the list `template`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` are not equal, `template` will contain one element, which is the uppercase version of `a[i]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition about `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged.
