### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. This part is correct and will be used in the main logic of `func_2`.

#### Function `func_2`:
The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the current implementation in `func_2` does not correctly achieve this. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Incorrect Iteration Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1`. It calculates `x` as `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` as `i * i`.
   - The expression `x // y + (i > 1)` is added to `cnt` in each iteration. This logic does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Misunderstanding the Condition**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be checked for every pair \((a, b)\) within the specified ranges.
   - The current implementation does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition for each pair.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the example provided in the problem statement: \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\). The expected output is 14 valid pairs, but the function returns 14, which seems correct initially. However, upon further inspection, the function does not correctly handle other cases like \(n = 100\) and \(m = 1233\), where the expected output is 153.

Given these observations, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given condition.
