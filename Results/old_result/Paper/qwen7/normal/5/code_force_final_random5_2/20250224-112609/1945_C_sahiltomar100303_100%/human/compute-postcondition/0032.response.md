Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 2, `leftZero` is 6, `leftOne` is 4, `tleftOne` is 2**

Explanation: The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Given that `tleftZero` was initially 2, after executing this line, `tleftZero` becomes 3. However, since the question asks to include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed, we keep the other variables unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `tleftZero` being incremented to 3 (or more specifically, 2 + 1), while the other variables remain as they were.
