Output State: The value of `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` equals `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` is the number of times the loop executed, which means `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. For each iteration, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, and `d` is calculated as `c / 2`. After executing the if-else block, the output is either `a * b` if it is less than `a * d`, or `round(a * d)` otherwise. The final state does not depend on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each iteration but rather on the completion of the loop with `i` equal to `n`.
