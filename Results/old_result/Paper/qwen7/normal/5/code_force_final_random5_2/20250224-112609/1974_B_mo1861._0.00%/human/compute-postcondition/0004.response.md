Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `c`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over the enumerated values of the sorted set of `b`.
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in the sorted set of `b`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{c: 'z'}`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `c` is the first unique character in the sorted form of `b`.

4. **Next iteration requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the sorted set of `b` must still have elements.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next unique character in the sorted form of `b` will be the second unique character.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `c` will be the second unique character in the sorted form of `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {c: 'z'}, `i` is 2, and `c` is the second unique character in the sorted form of `b`.**
