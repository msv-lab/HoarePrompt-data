Output State: **`j` is 32, `c` remains as it was initially set, `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` reflect the count of 0s and 1s respectively up to that bit position, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` reflect the count of 0s and 1s from that bit position to the end of the integer `c`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `y` is equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is increased by `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
