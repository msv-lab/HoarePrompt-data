Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is 0, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `i` is incremented by 1, `bullets_needed` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `health` (which is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list) to the variable `bullets_needed`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
