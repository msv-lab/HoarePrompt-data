Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is either the input integer or updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing two elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` and `foundb` are `False`, `i` is 2, and `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**
