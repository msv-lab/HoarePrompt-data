Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is halved from its current value, `k` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is now an integer obtained by dividing the original `n` by 2.**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. This means `n` is now its original value divided by 2. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
