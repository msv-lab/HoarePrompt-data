Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with `[1000]` followed by the sum of the elements from `T` up to the `(n-2)`th index, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`, `line` is the line input from the user, `T` is a list of integers converted from the split input line.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` takes the input line from the user, splits it into individual strings, and then converts each string into an integer, storing the result in the list `T`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
