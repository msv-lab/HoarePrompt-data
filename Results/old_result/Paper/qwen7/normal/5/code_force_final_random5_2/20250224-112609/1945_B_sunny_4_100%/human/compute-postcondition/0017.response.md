Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, integers `a`, `b`, and `m` such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}. It returns a result based on these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integers `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case according to the given constraints.
