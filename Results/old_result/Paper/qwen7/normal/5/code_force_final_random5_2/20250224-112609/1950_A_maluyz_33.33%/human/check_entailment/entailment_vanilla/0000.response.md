Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met. This part is correct.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a == b == c` and prints 'NONE' if this condition is met. However, this check should be done after checking the stair condition, as a sequence that is both equal can't be a stair or a peak.
5. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `max(a, b, c) == b`. This is a correct way to check for the peak condition, but it needs to be placed after the stair condition check.
6. **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'NONE'. This is correct.

However, there is an issue with the order of the checks. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles sequences where all three numbers are equal (`a == b == c`). When `a == b == c`, the program should print 'NONE', but it incorrectly prints 'PEAK' because the peak condition check is evaluated before the equality check.

### Corrected Version:
To fix this, we need to ensure that the equality check is done last. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in the order of conditions. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
