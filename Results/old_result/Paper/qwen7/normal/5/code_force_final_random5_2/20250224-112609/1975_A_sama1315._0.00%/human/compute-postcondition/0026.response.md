Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 3 * n + 2 + n`, `n` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `arr` is updated to be `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `t` is `t - 2`, `results.append(result)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code appends the `result` to the `results` list. The value of `results` changes by adding one more element, which is the `result`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
