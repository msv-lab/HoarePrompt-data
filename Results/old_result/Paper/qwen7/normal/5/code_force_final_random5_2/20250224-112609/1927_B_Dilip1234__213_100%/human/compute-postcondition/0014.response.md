Postcondition: `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `char_count[j]` is 2, and `s` is equal to 'ab'. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `i` is set to 1, `j` is set to 3, `n` remains at least 1, `char_count[j]` is set to 3, and `s` is equal to 'abc'. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `char_count[j]`, and `s` remain unchanged.
