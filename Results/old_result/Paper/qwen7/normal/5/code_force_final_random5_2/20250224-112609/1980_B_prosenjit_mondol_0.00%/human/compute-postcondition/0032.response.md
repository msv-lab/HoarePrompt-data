Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is now `k - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `a` is sorted in descending order, `f` is decreased by 1, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`. Since both the if and else parts result in the same state of the variables, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
