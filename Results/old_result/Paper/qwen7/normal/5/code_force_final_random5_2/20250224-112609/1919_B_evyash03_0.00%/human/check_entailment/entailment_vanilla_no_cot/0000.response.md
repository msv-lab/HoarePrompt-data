Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not designed to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Instead, it counts the number of segments where the balance goes negative, which is not relevant to the penalty calculation.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to calculate the penalty based on the optimal way to split the array into subarrays, minimizing the total penalty. The current implementation does not achieve this. Here's a corrected approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    
    # Calculate the prefix sums to help with the penalty calculation
    prefix_sums = [0]
    current_sum = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            current_sum += 1
        else:
            current_sum -= 1
        prefix_sums.append(current_sum)
    
    # Find the minimum penalty
    min_penalty = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, len(prefix_sums)):
        current_penalty = abs(prefix_sums[i]) * (i - (prefix_sums[i-1] // (prefix_sums[i] // (i - prefix_sums[i-1]))))
        min_penalty = min(min_penalty, current_penalty)
    
    print(min_penalty)
```

This corrected code calculates the prefix sums to determine the sum of elements up to each position in the array. It then iterates through these prefix sums to find the optimal way to split the array and minimize the total penalty.
