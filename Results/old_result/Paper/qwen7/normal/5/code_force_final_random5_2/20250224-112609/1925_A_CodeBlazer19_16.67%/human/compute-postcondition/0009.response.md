Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the string 'ab', `j` is 99**

Explanation: The variable `s` is initially the string 'a' followed by the character with ASCII value 98 (which is 'b'). The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character with ASCII value 99 (which is 'c') to the string `s`. Therefore, `s` becomes 'ab' + 'c' which is 'abc'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged.
