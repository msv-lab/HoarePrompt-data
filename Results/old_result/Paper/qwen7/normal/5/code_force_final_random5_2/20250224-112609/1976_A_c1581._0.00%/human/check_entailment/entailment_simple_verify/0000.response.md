### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code and the logic of the `func_1` function to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a password string and processes it to check if it meets the conditions for a strong password.
   - It separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.

2. **Checking Digits and Letters Separately:**
   - The function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It also checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Checking the Order Between Digits and Letters:**
   - The function iterates through the password and keeps track of the last digit index (`last_digit_index`).
   - If a non-digit character is encountered after a digit, the function immediately returns "NO".

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call:** 
  - `password` is a string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
  
- **State After Iterating Through Password:**
  - `digits` contains all digits from the password.
  - `letters` contains all lowercase Latin letters from the password.
  - `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the password (or -1 if no digits are present).

- **Key Checks:**
  - The function ensures that no digit comes after a letter by checking the `last_digit_index` and ensuring that any non-digit character encountered after setting `last_digit_index` to a positive value results in a "NO".
  - The function also checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given these checks, the function correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem description:
- No digit comes after a letter.
- All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly handle the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter. However, upon reviewing the annotated code, we see that the function does indeed check for this condition properly. The function iterates through the password and ensures that any non-digit character encountered after a digit results in an immediate "NO". Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
