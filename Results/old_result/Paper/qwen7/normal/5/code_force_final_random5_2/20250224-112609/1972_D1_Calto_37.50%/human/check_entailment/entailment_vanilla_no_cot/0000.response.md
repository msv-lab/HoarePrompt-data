Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not align with the problem statement. Specifically, `func_1` is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD), but it is not used in the way the problem requires. `func_2` attempts to calculate something related to the problem but does not correctly implement the logic needed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
