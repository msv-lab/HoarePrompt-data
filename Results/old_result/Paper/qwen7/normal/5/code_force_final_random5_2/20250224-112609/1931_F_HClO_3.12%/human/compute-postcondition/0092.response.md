Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is -1, `val` is an empty list, `l2` is inserted with `a2` at index `idx1`, `l` is equal to `l2`.**

The code `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. Since `l2` was previously modified by inserting `a2` at index `idx1`, `l` now holds the same list as `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
