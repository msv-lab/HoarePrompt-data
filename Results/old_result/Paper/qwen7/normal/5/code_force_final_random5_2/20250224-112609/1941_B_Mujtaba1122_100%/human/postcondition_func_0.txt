The function accepts a list of integers and an integer representing the length of the list. It checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns False immediately. If the function completes the iteration over the entire list without finding any non-zero elements, it returns True. The function can return either True or False based on the contents of the list.
