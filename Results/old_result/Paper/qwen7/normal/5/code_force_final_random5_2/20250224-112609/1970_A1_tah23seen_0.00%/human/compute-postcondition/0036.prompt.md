You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The dictionary `d` will contain keys from `1` to `len(s)`, where each key's value is determined by the cumulative count of parentheses. Starting from `d[0] = 0`, for every opening parenthesis `(` encountered in the string `s`, the value increases by 1, and for every closing parenthesis `)` encountered, the value decreases by 1.
    #
    #For example, if the string `s` is `"((()))"`, after the loop completes, the dictionary `d` will look like this: `{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 0}`. This indicates that starting from index 0, the count increases by 1 for each opening parenthesis and decreases by 1 for each closing parenthesis as we move through the string.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the values associated with its keys, `i` is the last key in the sorted dictionary, `j` is the value associated with the last key in the sorted dictionary, `ans` is the sum of `s[i]` for all keys `i` in the dictionary `d`.
    #
    #In this final state, the dictionary `d` remains sorted based on the values of its keys. The variable `i` holds the key of the last element in the sorted dictionary, and `j` holds the corresponding value. The variable `ans` contains the cumulative sum of `s[i]` for every key `i` present in the dictionary `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the cumulative sum of `s[i]` for every key `i` present in the dictionary `d`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The function returns the cumulative sum of `s[i]` for every key `i` present in the dictionary `d`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the cumulative sum of `s[i]` for every key `i` present in the dictionary `d`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
