Output State: **`i` is `12 + len(pres)`, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - (12 + len(pres) - 1)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)` calculates the maximum values from the lists `ptss` and `ptsb` and assigns them to `maxs` and `maxb` respectively. The values of `i`, `k`, `rem`, `ptsb`, and `ptss` remain unchanged from their previous states.
