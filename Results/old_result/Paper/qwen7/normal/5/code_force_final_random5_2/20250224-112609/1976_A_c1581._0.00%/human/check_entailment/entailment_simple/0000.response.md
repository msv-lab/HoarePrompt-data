Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads all test cases and their respective passwords using `sys.stdin.read()` and `split()`. It then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Separating Digits and Letters**: In the `func_1` function, the program correctly separates the digits and letters into two lists. This ensures that the conditions about the order of digits and letters can be checked independently.

3. **Checking Digit Order**: The program checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password. If such a digit is found, it immediately returns 'NO'. This logic is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Sorting Checks**: The program checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the original lists of digits and letters with their sorted versions. If either list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'. This logic is also correct.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the password consists entirely of digits or letters. For example, a password like "011679" or "allllmost" would be correctly identified as strong.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to verify whether a password meets the specified criteria.

Correctness: **True**
