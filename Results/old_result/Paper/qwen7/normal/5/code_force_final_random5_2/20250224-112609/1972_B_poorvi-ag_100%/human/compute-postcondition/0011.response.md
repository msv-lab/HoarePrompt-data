Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the value `t`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
   - `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D"
   - `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively
   - `arr` is the input string from the user

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is an input parameter and not modified within the loop.

5. **New State**:
   - `i` will be 1 (since it was 0 and is incremented by 1)
   - `t` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration (an input integer between 1 and 100)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively, and `arr` is the input string from the user**.
