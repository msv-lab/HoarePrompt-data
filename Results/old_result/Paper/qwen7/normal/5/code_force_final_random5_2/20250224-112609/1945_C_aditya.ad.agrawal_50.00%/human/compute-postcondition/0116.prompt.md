Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `input_string` is a string input by the user, `i` is the last element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 0, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `b_d` remains unchanged, `ans` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `o_l` is 0, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `z_l` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)`, then `b_d` remains 3; otherwise, `b_d` becomes 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second last element of `arr`, `pos` is assigned to `ans`, `o_r` is 0, `z_r` is 1 (since `z_r` was decreased by 1 when `i` was 0), `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, and the condition `(o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)))` is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 1, `o_r` is either 0 or -1, `z_r` is either 0 or 1, and `b_d` is recalculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. If the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true, `b_d` is further adjusted to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second-to-last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans`, `o_r` is either 0, -1, or -2, `z_r` is either 0 or 1, `b_d` is recalculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, and either `z_l` is increased by 1 or `o_l` is increased by 1. If the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true, then the postcondition remains unchanged. If the condition is false, the postcondition also remains unchanged since there is no else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
