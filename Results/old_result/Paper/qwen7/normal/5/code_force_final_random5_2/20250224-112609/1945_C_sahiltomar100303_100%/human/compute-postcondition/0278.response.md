Output State: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - right`, and `trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - (n - right)`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `right` will reach `n` because the loop continues as long as `right < n`. The conditions inside the loop ensure that `tleftZero` and `trightZero` are updated based on the number of zeros encountered, and `trightOne` is similarly updated based on the number of ones. Since the loop iterates until `right` reaches `n`, `tleftZero` will be less than or equal to `n // 2` and `trightZero` will be reduced by the total number of zeros from `mid` to `n-1`. Similarly, `trightOne` will be reduced by the total number of ones from `mid` to `n-1`. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.
