Output State: **`b` is an input string, `list2` is a sorted list of integers converted from all words in `b`, `s` is 0, `final` is [0], `num` is incremented by the number of words in `b`, `a` is an input string, `list1` is a list of words from the string `b`**.

Explanation: The code `list2.sort()` sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. Since `list2` originally contained integer values converted from the words in the input string `b`, sorting it does not change its content but only rearranges the elements in ascending order. The other variables (`s`, `final`, `num`, `a`, and `list1`) remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code.
