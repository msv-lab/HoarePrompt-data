Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 1, `o_r` is either 0 or -1, `z_r` is either 0 or 1, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - (ans + 1))`, and `b_d` is recalculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b_d` to be the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`. Since `pos` is equal to `ans + 1` and `ans` is equal to `pos`, `pos` remains unchanged. Therefore, `b_d` is recalculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, which is the same as the previous value of `b_d`. All other variables remain unchanged.
