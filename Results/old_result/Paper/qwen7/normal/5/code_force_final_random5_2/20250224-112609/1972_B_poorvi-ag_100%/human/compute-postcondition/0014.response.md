Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing 'yes' as its last element, and `arr` is a new string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' based on the count of 'U' in `arr`, appending `'yes'` to it means the final state of `results` will end with `'yes'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
