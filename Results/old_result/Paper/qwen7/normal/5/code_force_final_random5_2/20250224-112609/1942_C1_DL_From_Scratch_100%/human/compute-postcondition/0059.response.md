To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - After the if-else block executes, `i` is `x - 1`.
   - `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1 if `num` equals 1.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement to be executed is `print(count + x - 2)`.

3. **Understanding Variables**:
   - `i = x - 1`: This tells us the value of `i` after the if-else block.
   - `num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`: This gives us the formula for calculating `num`.
   - `count`: This variable is incremented by 1 if `num` equals 1. Therefore, `count` will be 1 if `num` is 1, otherwise it will be 0.

4. **Determining `num`**:
   - To know the exact value of `num`, we need to evaluate the expression `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.
   - Since `list0[0]` is the first element of `list0` and `list0[-1]` is the last element of `list0`, we need to know these values to proceed.
   - However, without specific values for `list0[0]`, `list0[-1]`, and `n`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `num`.

5. **Determining `count`**:
   - `count` will be 1 if `num` equals 1, otherwise it will be 0.

6. **Final Expression**:
   - The print statement is `print(count + x - 2)`.
   - If `num` is 1, then `count` will be 1, so the expression becomes `1 + x - 2 = x - 1`.
   - If `num` is not 1, then `count` will be 0, so the expression becomes `0 + x - 2 = x - 2`.

Given the information, we can conclude that the exact value of `num` is not provided, but we know how `count` is determined based on `num`.

Output: **x - 1 (if num is 1) or x - 2 (if num is not 1)**
