Output State: **`i` is 1, `matches` is decreased by the minimum of `window_freq[a[i]]` and `b_freq[a[i]]`, and `good_subarrays` is increased by 1 if `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `matches` is decreased by the minimum of `window_freq[a[i]]` and `b_freq[a[i]]`. If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `good_subarrays` is increased by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
