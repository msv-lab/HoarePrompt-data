Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is `n - 1`. If `row1[j]` is '>', both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` become True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains False while `reachable_second_row` stays True.
