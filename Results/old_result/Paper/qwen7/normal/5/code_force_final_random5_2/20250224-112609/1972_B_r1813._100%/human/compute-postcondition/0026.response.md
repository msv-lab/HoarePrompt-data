Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `s` is now the string `data[5]`, `index` is 7, `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the string `s`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` updates the value of `n` to be the integer value of `data[7]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and the value of `index` being 7 are still valid. The value of `s` and `count_u` remain as they were initially.
