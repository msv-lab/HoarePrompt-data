State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the range parameter.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
- Therefore, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `t` must be greater than 0.
