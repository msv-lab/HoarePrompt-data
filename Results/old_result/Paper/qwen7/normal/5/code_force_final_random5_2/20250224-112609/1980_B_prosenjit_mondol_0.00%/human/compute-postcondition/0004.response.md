Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged except that `k` is decreased by 1 due to the condition mentioned in the initial state.
