Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `s` is \((n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2\), and we increment `s` by `x`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by `x`. Given that `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), the new value of `s` becomes \((n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
