Output State: **`x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split**.

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y` respectively. Since the exact input values are not specified, we can only say that `x` and `y` are integers resulting from the split and conversion operation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
