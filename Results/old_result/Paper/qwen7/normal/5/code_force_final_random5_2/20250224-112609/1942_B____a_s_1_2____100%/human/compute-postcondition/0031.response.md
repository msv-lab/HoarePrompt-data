Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is `t - 3`, `n` is the same, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`, `a` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
