Output State: **`trightZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `right` equals `n + 1`, `tleftOne` is 0, `left` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `s` is an input string, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0**

Explanation: The line `trightZero = 0` sets `trightZero` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
