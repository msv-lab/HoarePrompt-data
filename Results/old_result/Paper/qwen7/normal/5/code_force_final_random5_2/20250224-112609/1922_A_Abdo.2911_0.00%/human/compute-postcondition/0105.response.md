Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
