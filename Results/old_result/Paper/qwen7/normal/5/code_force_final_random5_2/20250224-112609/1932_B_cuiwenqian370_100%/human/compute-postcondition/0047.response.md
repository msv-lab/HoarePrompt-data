Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is `a[0]`, `next_year` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `results` is a list containing the string "4", `index` is increased by `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `last_year`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `last_year` is now `a[0]`, while the other variables retain their previous states.
