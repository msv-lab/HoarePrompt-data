Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \), followed by \( t \) pairs of integers \( n \) and strings \( s \). For each pair, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string \( s \). If the count of 'U' characters is odd, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
