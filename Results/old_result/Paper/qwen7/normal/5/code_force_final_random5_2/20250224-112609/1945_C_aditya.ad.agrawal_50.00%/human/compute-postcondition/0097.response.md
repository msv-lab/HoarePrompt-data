Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 1, `o_r` is 0, `z_r` is 0, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - (ans + 1))`, and the condition `(o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - (ans + 1))))` is true.**

Explanation: The code `z_r -= 1` decreases the value of `z_r` by 1. Initially, `z_r` was equal to 1. After executing the code, `z_r` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged, and the condition remains true as no changes were made to the variables involved in the condition.
