Output State: **`i` is 31, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 32, and `suf[0][0]` is 1, and `(cur >> j & 1)` is false**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, `suf[0][0]` is incremented by 1, making its value 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
