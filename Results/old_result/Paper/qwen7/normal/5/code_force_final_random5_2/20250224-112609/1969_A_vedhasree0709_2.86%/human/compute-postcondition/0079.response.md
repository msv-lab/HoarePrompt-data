The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, `i` must be incremented to 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers, and the current value of `l[i]` is 2, the current value of `l[i + 1]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
