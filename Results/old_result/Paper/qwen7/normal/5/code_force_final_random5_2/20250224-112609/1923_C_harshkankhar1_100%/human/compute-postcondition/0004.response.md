Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2` assigns the value 1 to `x` only if the element at index `i` in the list `a` is greater than 1. Otherwise, it assigns the value 2 to `x`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, the condition `a[i] > 1` is not specified, but since no specific value for `a[i]` is given, we cannot determine if the condition is true or false. However, the code does assign a value to `x`, which is 2 in this case. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, `i` is 1 and `x` is 2.
