Output State: `t` must be equal to `n`, `i` is `t - n`, `n` is the same as the input integer, `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and each `p[i]` for `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `a` remains unchanged, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - a[i]` for the corresponding index `i`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will be equal to the input integer `n`, `i` will be `-1` (since `t - n` would be `n - n`), `mex` will be the smallest value among all `p[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `p` will contain the values `mex - a[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
