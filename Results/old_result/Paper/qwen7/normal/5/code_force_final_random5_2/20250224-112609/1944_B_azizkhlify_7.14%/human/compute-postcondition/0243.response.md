Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 4, and the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since `ul` was initially equal to `ur + 2`, the new value of `ul` will be `ur + 4`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
