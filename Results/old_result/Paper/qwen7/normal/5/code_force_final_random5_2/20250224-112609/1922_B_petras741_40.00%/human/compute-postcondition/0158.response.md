Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `eta` is an empty list.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < n + 1`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `n`.
   - Since `j` is already equal to `n`, the condition `j < n + 1` is no longer true.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.
   - Since `j` is already equal to `n`, the loop cannot execute again because the condition `j < n + 1` is false.
   - Therefore, there are no changes needed to these variables for the loop to execute again.

6. **Final State:**
   - The state remains the same as the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
