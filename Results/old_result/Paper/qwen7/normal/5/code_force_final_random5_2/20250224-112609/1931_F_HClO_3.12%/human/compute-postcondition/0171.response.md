Output State: **`m` is `n-2`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l1`, `l2`, `l22`, `l3`, `val`, `t`, `idx1`, and `idx2` retain their states from the last iteration of the loop, and `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1. This does not affect the values of `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l1`, `l2`, `l22`, `l3`, `val`, `t`, or `l11`. Therefore, these variables retain their states from the last iteration of the loop.
