Output State: **`last` is the last element of `nums`, `n` is an input integer, `curr` is 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code sets `curr` to 0, which updates the value of `curr`. All other variables (`last`, `n`, `t`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
