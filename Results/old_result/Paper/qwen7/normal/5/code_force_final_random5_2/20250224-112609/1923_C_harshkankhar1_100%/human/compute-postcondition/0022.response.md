Output State: **`x` is an integer from the first input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, and the program prints 'NO' if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y, otherwise it prints 'YES'.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them into `x` and `y`. It does not perform any operations on `a` or `b`, nor does it print anything. Therefore, the conditions for printing 'NO' or 'YES' remain as they were in the initial state. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers provided by the input, but the conditions involving `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
