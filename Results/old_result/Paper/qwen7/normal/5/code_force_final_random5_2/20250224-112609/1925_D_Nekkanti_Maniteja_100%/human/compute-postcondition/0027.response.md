Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `m * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`, `M` is `10 ** 9 + 7`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The line `M = 10 ** 9 + 7` assigns the value `1000000007` to the variable `M`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `k`, `s`, `n`, `m`, or `c`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `i`, `k`, and `s` as described in the initial state, and includes the new assignment for `M`.
