Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(a) // 2`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`.

3. **Initial state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to `len(a) // 2`.

4. **Determine if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `len(a) // 2` initially. However, since `i` is already set to `len(a) // 2`, the loop will not execute because the initial value of `i` is exactly equal to `len(a) // 2`.

5. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be less than `len(a) // 2` at the start. Therefore, we need to adjust the initial value of `i` to be one less than `len(a) // 2`.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`kq` is 0, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`**
