You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `count` will be equal to the total number of times `num` equals 1 across all iterations, plus `x - 2` for each iteration. `T` will be 0 since all test cases have been processed. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be as per the last test case's input, and `list0` will be the sorted list of integers from the last test case's input. The variable `i` will be `x - 1` for the last iteration, and `num` will be calculated based on the last `list0` but will not affect the final `count` value since the loop has completed.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `count` will sum up all instances where the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1, plus `x - 2` for each test case. `T` will be 0 because there are no more test cases to process. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, `i`, and `num`) will reflect the state of the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `T` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads a list of `x` integers representing the chosen vertices.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list of chosen vertices (`list0`) is sorted.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices to calculate the number of triangles.
   - For each pair of consecutive chosen vertices, it calculates the number of vertices between them (excluding the endpoints).
   - If the number of vertices between two consecutive chosen vertices is exactly 1, it increments the count of triangles.
   - After the loop, it calculates the number of vertices between the first and last chosen vertices, again checking if it is exactly 1 and incrementing the count if true.
   - Finally, it prints the total count of triangles plus `x - 2`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles reading the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - It also correctly sorts the list of chosen vertices, which is necessary for calculating the number of triangles.

2. **Triangle Calculation:**
   - The logic for counting triangles between consecutive chosen vertices is correct. If there is exactly one vertex between two chosen vertices, a triangle can be formed.
   - However, the logic for counting the triangle between the first and last chosen vertices is flawed. The condition `if num == 1:` should be `if num >= 1:` because even if there is only one vertex between the first and last chosen vertices, a triangle can still be formed.

3. **Final Count:**
   - The final count of triangles is calculated as `count + x - 2`. This is generally correct, but the initial count calculation needs adjustment.

### Corrected Logic

Here is the corrected logic:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num >= 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num >= 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)
```

### Conclusion

The original program has a flaw in the logic for counting the triangle between the first and last chosen vertices. The corrected program should handle this correctly.
