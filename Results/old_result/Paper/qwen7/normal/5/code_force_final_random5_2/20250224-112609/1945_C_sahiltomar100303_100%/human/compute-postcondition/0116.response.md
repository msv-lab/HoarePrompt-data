Output State: **`right` is less than `n`; `tleftZero` is equal to its previous value plus 1; `trightZero` is decreased by 1; `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` still holds.**

Explanation:
- The variable `trightZero` is decremented by 1.
- The condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` still holds, meaning that `tleftZero` is still less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` is still less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`.
- `tleftZero` is equal to its previous value plus 1, which is unchanged from the initial state.
