Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `m`, and the range function parameters.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `m-1` to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` will take values from `m-1` down to `1`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Initially, `i` is set to `0`.

4. **Adjust the state of `m`**: For the loop to start, `m` must be at least 2 because the loop runs from `m-1` down to `1`. If `m` is less than 2, the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being `0`, we need to ensure that the loop can start by setting `i` to `m-1` (the starting value of the loop).

6. **Ensure the loop can run**: The loop will run as long as `m` is at least 2 and `i` starts from `m-1` and decrements to `1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` and `i`. Specifically, `m` must be at least 2, and `i` must be set to `m-1`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**
