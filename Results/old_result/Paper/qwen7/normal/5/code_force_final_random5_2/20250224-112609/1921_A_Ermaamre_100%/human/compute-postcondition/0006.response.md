Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. The key variables here are `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers inputted by the user.
   - `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`.
   - `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t > 0`, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (assuming `t` is a counter that starts from some positive integer and decreases by 1 with each iteration).
   - The other variables (`a`, `x`, and `dx`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop continuation condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers inputted by the user, `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`, `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`**.
