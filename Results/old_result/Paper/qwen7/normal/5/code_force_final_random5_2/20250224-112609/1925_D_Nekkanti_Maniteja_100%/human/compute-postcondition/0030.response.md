Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is 0, `M` is 10, `c` is `(pow(m * (m - 1) // 2, -1, 10))`, `a` is 0**.

In this case, the code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `a`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `k`, `s`, `M`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
