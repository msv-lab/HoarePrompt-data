Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in results`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `results`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no'.
   - The first element of `results` is assigned to `i`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be an element of the `results` list. Since `results` is a list of 100 elements, the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was assigned the first element of `results`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be assigned the second element of `results`.
   - The list `results` will still contain 100 elements, but now it starts from the second element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no', and the second element of `results` is assigned to `i`**.
