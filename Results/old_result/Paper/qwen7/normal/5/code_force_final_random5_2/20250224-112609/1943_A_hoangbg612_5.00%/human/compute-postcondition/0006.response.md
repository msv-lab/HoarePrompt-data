Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `M` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `M`. No other changes are made to the existing variables (`cur`, `T`, `S`, and `N`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new empty dictionary `M` is created.
