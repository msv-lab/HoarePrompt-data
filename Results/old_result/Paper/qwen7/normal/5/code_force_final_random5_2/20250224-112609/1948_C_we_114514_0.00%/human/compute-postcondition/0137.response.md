Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True or False, `n` is equal to `n, (row1, row2)` from `test_case`, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and `results` contains either 'YES' or ['NO'] depending on the conditions met within the loop, and `test_case` is the next test case in `test_cases`**.

This output state reflects that the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to the first element of `test_case`, `j` is set to `n - 1`, and `results` and `test_case` retain their previous states.
