Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1; `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`; `num` is equal to `i`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that `i` was part of. The values of `i`, `iterable2`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the condition `i not in no` still holds true.
