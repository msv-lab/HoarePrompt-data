Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by space.
- The current value of `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Output: **Yes**
