Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character, `ret` is 0, and the character `i` is not '@'. If `i` equals '*', `thorn` is set to 2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.
