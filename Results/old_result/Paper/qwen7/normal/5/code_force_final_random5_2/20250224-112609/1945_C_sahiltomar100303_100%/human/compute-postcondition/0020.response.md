Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not '0'; `leftOne` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is not defined in the initial state, but the code increments `leftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially 1, after executing `tleftOne += 1`, `leftOne` becomes 2. The other variables (`i`, `mid`, and `s[i]`) remain unchanged.
