You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(" and ")". It calculates the depth of each position in the string by maintaining a dictionary `d` where keys are positions and values are the net balance of parentheses up to that position. After processing, it removes the last entry from `d`, sorts the remaining entries based on their values and keys, and constructs a new string `ans` by concatenating characters from `s` according to the sorted indices. Finally, it returns an empty string because the list `d` is empty and there are no valid indices to concatenate characters from `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It uses a dictionary `d` to keep track of the balance at each position in the string.
     - `d[0]` is initialized to 0.
     - For each character in the string, it updates the balance in the dictionary.
       - If the character is '(', the balance increases by 1.
       - If the character is ')', the balance decreases by 1.
   - After processing all characters, it removes the entry for the length of the string (`d.pop(n)`).
   - It sorts the dictionary items based on the balance (`x[1]`) in ascending order and position (`-x[0]`) in descending order.
   - It constructs the result string `ans` by concatenating the characters at the sorted positions.
   - Finally, it returns the result string `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The balance calculation is correct. The dictionary `d` keeps track of the balance at each position accurately.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The sorting logic is correct. It sorts the keys of the dictionary based on the balance in ascending order and position in descending order.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - The result string `ans` is constructed by concatenating the characters at the sorted positions. This ensures that the resulting string maintains the correct balance and order as required by the balanced shuffle operation.

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the input `(()(()))`:
- Balance calculation:
  ```
  Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3
  Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
  Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
  ```
- Sorting:
  ```
  Sorted keys| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
  Sorted characters| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
  Result| ()(()())
  ```

The output matches the expected result `()(()())`.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
