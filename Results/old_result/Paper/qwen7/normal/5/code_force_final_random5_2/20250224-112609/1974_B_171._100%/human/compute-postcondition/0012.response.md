Output State: **`decoded` is a string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character from `char_map`; `len_unique` is less than or equal to `i`, every key in `char_map` is paired with its corresponding character such that `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` equals `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]` for all valid `j`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new string `decoded` by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from `char_map`. The values of `len_unique`, `i`, and the structure of `char_map` remain unchanged, but now `decoded` contains the decoded version of `encoded` based on the mappings defined in `char_map`.
