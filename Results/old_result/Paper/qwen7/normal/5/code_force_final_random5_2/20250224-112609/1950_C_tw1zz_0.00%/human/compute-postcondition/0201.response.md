Output State: **`h1` is '03', `m1` is `m`, `time` is 'AM', `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. This does not affect any other variables, so their states remain unchanged. The `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, and `num_iterations` variables retain their initial states.
