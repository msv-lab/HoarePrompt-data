Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` adds the last element of the last element in list `a` to the current value of `last_row`. Since `a` contains only one element, which is a list, `a[-1]` refers to that single list, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last element of that list. The initial state does not specify the value of `last_row`, so it is assumed to be 0 before the operation. After executing the code, `last_row` is updated to its original value plus the last element of the list contained in `a`.
