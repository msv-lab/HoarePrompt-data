Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. All other variables (n, f, k, and a) remain in their initial state as they have not been affected by the code.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    same_value_count = 0
    for value in a:
        if value == favorite_value:
            same_value_count += 1
    greater_count = 0
    for value in a:
        if value > favorite_value:
            greater_count += 1
    if greater_count >= k:
        print('YES')
    elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `greater_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and `same_value_count` remains unchanged as it equals the total number of times `value` in list `a` matches `favorite_value`. In both cases (whether `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k` or less than `k`), the postcondition holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final value of `greater_count` is the total count of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, `greater_count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `greater_count` is adjusted so that when combined with `same_value_count`, the total does not exceed `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `greater_count` will be equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` will be between 0 and the length of list `a`, inclusive, `n` will be the integer value of the first input, `f` will be the integer value of the second input, `k` will be the integer value of the third input, and `favorite_value` will be the element at index `f - 1` in list `a`. Furthermore, if `greater_count >= k`, the condition remains true. Otherwise, if `greater_count + same_value_count` is greater than `k`, `greater_count` is updated to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than the `favorite_value`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
