Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(mid, n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `mid`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `i` is at least `mid` and `n` is greater than `mid`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `mid` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Postcondition After Incrementing `i`:**
   - Since `i` was at least `mid` at the end of the previous iteration, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will be at least `mid + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `mid` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is at least `mid + 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`**
