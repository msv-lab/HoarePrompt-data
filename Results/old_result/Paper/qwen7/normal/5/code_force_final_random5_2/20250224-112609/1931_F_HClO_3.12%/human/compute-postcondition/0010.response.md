Output State: **`a1` is the first integer input, `l1` is a list of remaining integers input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a2` is the second integer input from the split, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input after the second integer.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input and splits it into two parts. The first part (the first integer) is assigned to `a2`, and the rest of the integers are collected into a list `l2`. The initial values of `a1`, `l1`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
