Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `nums` must contain at least one element.
- If the index `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in nums:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `nums`. Therefore, the variables `i` and `nums` are relevant to the loop head.
2. **Postcondition**: The postcondition mentions that if `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated based on `i` and `last`. However, since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `i` changes and how it affects the subsequent iteration.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value from `nums`, and `curr` might have been updated based on the value of `i` (if `i` was not 0).
2. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will take the next value from `nums`. Since `nums` must contain at least one element, there will always be a next value unless `nums` is exhausted.
3. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be the next element from `nums`.
   - `curr` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (if `i` is not 0).

### Updated State:
- `nums` will still contain at least one element because the loop continues as long as `nums` has elements.
- `i` will be the next element from `nums`.
- `curr` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (if `i` is not 0).

### Final Answer:
State: **`nums` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element from `nums`, `curr` is updated based on the new value of `i` (if `i` is not 0)**.

To be more precise, we can say:

State: **`nums` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element from `nums`, `curr` is updated based on the new value of `i` (if `i` is not 0)**.

This ensures that the state is correctly adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.
