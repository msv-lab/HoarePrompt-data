Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than (left + 1) // 2 or `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2, `leftOne` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` is incremented by 1. Since `leftOne` is decreased by 1 before this line, `leftOne` becomes 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
