### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts of `a` are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `k >= 2`, it checks specific conditions:
     - If `n == k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - If `k < 2`, it prints numbers from `1` to `n`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when `k == n` by printing `k` repeated `k` times.
   - However, it does not handle other cases where `k` can be 1 or less than `k` but not equal to `n`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `k == 1`, the program prints numbers from `1` to `n`. This is incorrect because it doesn't ensure exactly one cyclic shift is sorted.
   - When `k > 1` and `n != k`, the program prints `-1`, which is also incorrect because there can be arrays with more than one sorted cyclic shift.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - For `k == 1`, we need to construct an array where only one cyclic shift is sorted.
   - For `k > 1` and `n != k`, we need to construct an array where exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
