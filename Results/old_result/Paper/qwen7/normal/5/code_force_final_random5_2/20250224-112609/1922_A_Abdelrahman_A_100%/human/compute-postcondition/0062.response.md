Postcondition: `counter` is incremented by 1, the value of `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `x` is not found in both `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`. If `x` is found in either `a[counter]` or `b[counter]`, the value of `no` remains unchanged and no additional actions are taken.
