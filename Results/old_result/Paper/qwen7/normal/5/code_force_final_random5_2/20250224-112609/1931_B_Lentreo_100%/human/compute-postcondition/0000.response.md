Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, which is an integer, and the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`. Each element in `nums` is in the range 0 <= a_i <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(nums)` assigns the length of the list `nums` to the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n` and each element in `nums` is in the specified range remains valid.
