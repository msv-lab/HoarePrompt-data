The function accepts an integer \( x \) where \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \). It searches for the largest integer \( y \) such that \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2y \geq x \). If no such \( y \) exists, it returns \( x - 2 \) or \( x - 3 \) depending on the values found during the search. If no valid \( y \) is found through these checks, it returns the largest \( y \) satisfying the conditions or 1 if no such \( y \) exists.
