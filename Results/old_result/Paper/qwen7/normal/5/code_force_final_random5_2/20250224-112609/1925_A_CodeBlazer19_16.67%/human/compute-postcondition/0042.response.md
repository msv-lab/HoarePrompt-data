The code `s += chr(j)` updates the string `s` by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` (which is 99) to `s`. Since `s` was initially "b", appending the character with ASCII value 99 (which is 'c') results in the string "bc". The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is 105, `s` is the string "bc", `j` is 99**
