Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the input and initializes variables to track the balance and the count of resets.
2. It iterates through each character in the input string, updating the balance and counting the number of times the balance becomes negative, which triggers a reset.
3. After the loop, it checks if the final balance is positive, and if so, adds one to the count.
4. However, the logic in the function `func_1` does not actually compute the minimum penalty as required by the problem statement. Instead, it simply counts the number of times the balance is reset to zero when it goes negative, plus one if the final balance is positive. This does not account for the actual penalty calculation, which involves the absolute value of the sum of the segments multiplied by their lengths.

Given the problem description, the function should calculate the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into segments where the sum of each segment is as close to zero as possible. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Correctness: **False**

To solve the problem correctly, the function needs to implement a strategy to minimize the penalty, likely involving dynamic programming or a greedy approach to split the array into segments with minimal absolute sums.
