Output State: **`N` is not empty, `cur` is the element after the next element in `N`, and `M[cur]` remains 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Initially, `cur` was set to be the next element in `N`. After executing the code, `cur` now points to the element after the next element in `N`. The other conditions and the value of `M[cur]` remain unchanged.
