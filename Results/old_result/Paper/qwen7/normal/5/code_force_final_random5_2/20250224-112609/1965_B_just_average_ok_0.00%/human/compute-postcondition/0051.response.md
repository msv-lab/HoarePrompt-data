Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)**.

Explanation: The variable `idx` was initially set to 24. After executing `idx -= 1`, `idx` is decremented by 1, resulting in `idx` being 23. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation.
