Output State: **All elements in the list `N` have been processed, `cur` is the current value of the last unique number encountered plus 1 or -1 if no such number exists, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, and `M` is a dictionary where keys are the unique numbers from `N` (or -1) that are greater than `cur` and their values are 1, and for all other keys in `M`, the values are the counts of occurrences of those numbers in `N`. The sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`N`, `T`, `S`, and `M`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
