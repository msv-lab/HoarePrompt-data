Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `idx` is 23.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). The value of `t` does not affect the list `nums`, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.
   - `n` is an input integer, but it is not used in the construction of the list `nums` or the print statement.
   - `k` must be at least 16777216.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with an additional element `k - 2^{23}` and `k + 1` appended to it.
     - This means `nums` contains the numbers \(1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 8388608, k - 8388608, k + 1\).
   - The element \(1 << idx\) (which is \(1 << 23\)) is removed from the list `nums`.

2. **Construction of `nums`:**
   - The list starts with \(1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 8388608\).
   - It then includes `k - 8388608` and `k + 1`.
   - Finally, it excludes \(1 << 23\), which is \(8388608\).

3. **Elements in `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` will contain all numbers from \(1\) to \(8388608\) except \(8388608\), followed by `k - 8388608` and `k + 1`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(*nums)` will print the elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces.

Given the above breakdown, the list `nums` will look like this:
\[1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 8388604, 8388608 - 8388608, k - 8388608, k + 1\]

Since `8388608 - 8388608` simplifies to `0`, the list `nums` will be:
\[1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 8388604, 0, k - 8388608, k + 1\]

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **1 2 4 8 ... 8388604 0 [k - 8388608] [k + 1]**
