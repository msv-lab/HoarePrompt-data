Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `res` contains elements, but its specific contents are not relevant to the print statement.
- `ul` is not equal to `ur`, but these variables are also not relevant to the print statement.
- The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, we need to determine the value of `a[n]`. However, the value of `a[n]` is not explicitly given. But we know that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, which implies that `r[a[n] - 1]` is 2. This means that `a[n] - 1` is the index in the list `r` where the value 2 is found. Without loss of generality, let's assume `a[n] = 3` (since `a[n] - 1 = 2`).

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a[n]`, which is 3, twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **3 3**
