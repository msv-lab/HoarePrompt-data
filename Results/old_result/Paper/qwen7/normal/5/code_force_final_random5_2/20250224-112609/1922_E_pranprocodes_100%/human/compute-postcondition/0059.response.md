Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1 minus 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing `-100000000`, `t` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, making it an input integer greater than 0 (since it was initially greater than 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
