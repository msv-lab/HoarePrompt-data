Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` is set to `i` or `idx2` is set to `i`; now `idx1` is 2 and `idx2` is 2, `p2` is 1, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement, the values of `i`, `n`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The conditions specified in the initial state also remain valid.
