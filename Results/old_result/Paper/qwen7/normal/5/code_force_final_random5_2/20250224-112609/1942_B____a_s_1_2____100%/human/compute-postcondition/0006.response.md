Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `i` will start from `n - 1` and decrement until it reaches `-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (since `n - 1` should be a valid starting point for the range function).
   - The loop will run as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` starts from `n - 1` and decrements, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.
   - `i` will be initialized to `n - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `p` is a list of length `n` where every element is `-1`.
- `mex` is equal to `n`.

We need to focus on adjusting the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

**Final State Adjustment:**
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` must start from `n - 1`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`**
