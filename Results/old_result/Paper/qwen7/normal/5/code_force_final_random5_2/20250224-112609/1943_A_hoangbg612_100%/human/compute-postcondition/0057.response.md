Output State: **All keys in the dictionary `M` have been checked, and for each key `k` where `M[k]` equals 1, the value `k` has been appended to the list `cnt`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, every key in the dictionary `M` that has a value of 1 will have been added to the list `cnt`. This means `cnt` will contain all the unique numbers from the dictionary `M` that appear exactly once. The dictionary `M` itself does not change during the loop, and the other variables (`N`, `cur`, `T`, `S`, and `k`) are not directly modified within the loop body.
