Functionality: **The function processes a list of positive integers and handles multiple queries. It calculates the cumulative count of 1s and the adjusted cumulative sum of elements up to each index in the list. For each query, it checks if a specific condition is met based on the range of indices provided and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. After processing all queries, the function does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the `ones` and `sum` lists to reflect the cumulative counts and sums.**
