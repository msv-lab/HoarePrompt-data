Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all its iterations will be as follows:

- `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, as it was not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, as it was not modified inside the loop.
- `final` is a list that contains the sum of every second element from each `list2` created during the loop's iterations, starting from the first element of each `list2`. This means `final` will contain the sum of every second element from the first `list2`, then the sum of every second element from the second `list2`, and so on, for all iterations of the loop.

This output state reflects the cumulative sum of every second element from each `list2` created during the loop's execution, with the sums being stored in the `final` list.
Code of the loop:
for fin in final:
    print(fin)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `final` is an empty list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - Since `final` is currently empty, there are no elements left to iterate over.
   - Therefore, the loop cannot execute again because there are no more elements in `final`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `final` is an empty list, the loop cannot execute again. There are no adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time since it has already reached its termination condition.

### Final Answer:
State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `final` is an empty list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
