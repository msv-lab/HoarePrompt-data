Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - 3` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than `(mid - 1) // 2`, `rightZero` must be less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2`, and at least one of `leftZero < (mid - 1 + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - mid + 1 + 1) // 2` must hold true.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, the only change is that `left` is now `mid - 3` instead of `mid - 2`. All other conditions and constraints remain the same.
