### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Initialization and Input Handling
- The program initializes `inf` to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\).
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It creates a list `values` of size `inf` initialized to 0.

#### Precomputation
- For each integer `i` from 1 to `inf`, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i`.
- It updates the `values` list such that `values[i]` stores the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `i`.

#### Test Case Processing
- For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
- It prints `values[n]`, which is the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The initialization of `inf` to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\) is correct since the maximum value of `n` is \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - Reading `t` and initializing the `values` list is correct.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - The precomputation logic is correct. For each number `i` from 1 to `inf`, it correctly calculates the sum of its digits and updates the cumulative sum in the `values` array.
   - This ensures that `values[i]` contains the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

3. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The test case handling is correct. For each test case, it correctly uses the precomputed values to get the required sum for the range 1 to `n`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles large values of `n` up to \(2 \times 10^5\) efficiently due to the precomputation.
   - The input constraints are respected, and the program should work within the given time limit (0.5 seconds).

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation:

- The `values` list is initialized to 0, but the precomputation starts from index 1. This means `values[0]` is not used and can lead to incorrect results when accessing `values[1]` (which should be the sum of digits of 1).

To fix this, we need to initialize `values[0]` to 0 and start the precomputation from `i = 1`.

### Corrected Implementation

```python
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * (inf + 1)  # Initialize with one extra element to handle index 0
    for i in range(1, inf + 1):  # Start from 1 to include 0
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])
```

### Conclusion

The original assessment was incorrect because the `values` list was not properly initialized, leading to potential incorrect results. With the corrected implementation, the program will work as intended.

### Final Answer

Final: **False**
