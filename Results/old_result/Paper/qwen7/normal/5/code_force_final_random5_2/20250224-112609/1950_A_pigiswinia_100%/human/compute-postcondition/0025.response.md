The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the first, second, and third integer inputs, respectively. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`.

Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 2 and `t` must still be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input**
