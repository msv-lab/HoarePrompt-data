Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is an integer within the specified range, the precondition for `t` is updated to reflect that it is now an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. All other preconditions remain unchanged.
