Output State: **`s` is 0, `num` is the previous value of `num` incremented by 1, `list1` is an empty list, `b` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `b`. The other variables (`s`, `num`, and `list1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
