Output State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `i` is now equal to `num`, `less` must contain at least 3 integers, `no` must contain at least 3 integers, `big` must contain at least 1 integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
