Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is decremented by 1, `leftZero` is decremented by 1, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - (left + 1)) // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1, so it is now one less than its previous value. The condition involving `rightOne` remains unchanged because only `leftZero` was modified, and the relationship between `rightOne` and the other variables still holds.
