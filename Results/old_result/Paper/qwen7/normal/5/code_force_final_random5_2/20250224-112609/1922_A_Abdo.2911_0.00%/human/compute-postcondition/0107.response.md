Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `c` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the input string (after stripping whitespace) to the variable `c`. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
