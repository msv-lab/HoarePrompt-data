Output State: **`char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 1`, `char_count` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a string containing the character corresponding to the index `j` in the alphabet and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside, without changing the values of `char_count[j]`, `char_count`, `a`, and `s`.
