Postcondition: **All elements in the list are 0 or negative, with `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` all being 0. The loop terminates because none of the conditions inside the while loop are satisfied, as all relevant elements in the list have been reduced to 0 or below. Additionally, the function `func_1(list, n)` returns False.**
