Output State: **`arr` must have at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_l` is increased by 1**.

This means that `o_l` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions and values of `arr`, `i`, and `pos` remain as described in the initial state.
