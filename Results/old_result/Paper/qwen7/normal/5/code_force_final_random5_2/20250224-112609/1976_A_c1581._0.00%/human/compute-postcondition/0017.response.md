Output State: **`char` is the next character in the `password` string; `password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits; `letters` is a list with one additional element, which is `char`.**

Explanation: The code appends the character `char` to the list `letters`. Since `char` is the next character in the `password` string, it is added to the list `letters`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
