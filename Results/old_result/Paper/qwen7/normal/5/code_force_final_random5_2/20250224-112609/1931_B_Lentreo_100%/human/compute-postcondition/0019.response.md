Postcondition: **`total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is `nums[1] - mean + nums[2] - mean`, `i` is 3, and either the program returns 'NO' if `curr` is less than 0, or nothing happens if `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.**
