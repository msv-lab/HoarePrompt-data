Output State: **`pos` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The line `pos = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `pos` becomes 1, while `i` stays as 1, and the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `arr`) retain their original values from the initial state.
