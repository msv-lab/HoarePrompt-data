Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from `k=len(a)-1` down to `k=1`, `i` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `j` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` with `i` being the last updated index, `t2` is `abs(a[n - m] - c[m - 1])`, `a` is sorted in descending order, and `n`, `m`, `c` are as initially defined.**

Explanation: The code `c.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `c` in descending order. The other variables (`k`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `t1`, `t2`, `a`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
