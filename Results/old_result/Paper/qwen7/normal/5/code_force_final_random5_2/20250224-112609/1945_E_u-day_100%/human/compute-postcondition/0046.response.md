Postcondition: **`low` is either the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or it is equal to `high` if `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`. `high` is `n` if the loop exits because `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`. `mid` holds the last calculated midpoint value. `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2`, `mid` from the second iteration, and `mid` from the third iteration. The condition `arr[low] == k` is false.**
