Output State: **reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is True, n must be greater than 0, and the current value of j is n - 1.**

The code `reachable_second_row = True` updates the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and the current value of `j` is `n - 1` also remains valid.
