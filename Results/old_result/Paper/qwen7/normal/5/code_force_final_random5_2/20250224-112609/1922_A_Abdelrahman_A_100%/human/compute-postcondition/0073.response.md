Postcondition: **`no` is `False`, `i` is `1`, `slength` is the original input integer, `a` is the original input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the new input string, and `counter` is equal to the length of `c`.**

Explanation: Given the conditions in the if and else parts, the overall postcondition indicates that after executing the if-else block, `no` remains `False`, `i` stays as `1`, `slength` retains its original value, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `c` also remains unchanged, and `counter` is equal to the length of `c`. This is because the if condition checks if `c` matches either `a` or `b`, and if so, sets `no` to `False` and increments `counter`. If the condition is not met, the else part ensures that the state remains unchanged.
