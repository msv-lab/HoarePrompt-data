Output State: **`j` is 3, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` and then further increased by `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho` and then further increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[2]] + q[eta[j]]`**.

Explanation: The value of `j` remains unchanged at 3. The value of `eta_ln` remains unchanged as it must be greater than 1. The value of `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its current value. Since `j` is 3, this term is added to `res`. Additionally, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[2]]` from the previous state and further increased by `q[eta[j]]`, which is `q[eta[3]]`. Therefore, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[2]] + q[eta[3]]`.
