Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `c` is a list that either contains the first element of `a` divided into `y` and `x` (where `x` is the remainder of `a[0]` divided by 10 and `y` is `a[0]` // 10) or the first element of `a` alone, followed by additional elements as per the condition. `x` is the remainder of `a[0]` divided by 10; `y` is assigned the value of `int(a[1] / 10)`. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `i` is 1 and `n` is `n + 2`. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `n` is 1 more than its original value. If the condition `i == 0 and a[i] > 10` is false, `i` remains 2, `c` is updated by appending the second element of `a` to it, and `n` is incremented by 1.
