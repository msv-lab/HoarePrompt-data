Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(s)`. 

3. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `s` is a string.
   - `i` is an index within the string `s`.
   - The postcondition states that if the character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis ('('), then `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] + 1`. If the character at index `i` is not an opening parenthesis, then `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an index within the string `s`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i += 1`).

5. **Check the Postcondition for the Next Index**:
   - We need to check the character at the new index `i + 1` in the string `s` to determine the value of `d[i + 1]`.
   - If the character at `i + 1` is an opening parenthesis ('('), then `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] + 1`.
   - If the character at `i + 1` is not an opening parenthesis, then `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated index and the potential change in the value of `d[i + 1]`.

**State:**
- `s` is a string.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `d[i + 1]` is either `d[i] + 1` or `d[i] - 1`, depending on the character at `i + 1`.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`, and `d[i + 1]` is either `d[i] + 1` or `d[i] - 1**.
