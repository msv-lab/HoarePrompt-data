### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This means for each \( k_i \), the total bet should be less than \( k_i \times \text{bet on } k_i \).

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
```
This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). It returns the absolute value of their product divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
    return result
```
This function computes the LCM of a list of integers. It iteratively applies `func_1` to the current result and the next element in the list.

#### Main Program Logic:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = func_2(k)
    c = []
    for i in range(n):
        c.append(m // k[i])
    if sum(c) >= m:
        print(-1)
        continue
    for i in range(n):
        print(c[i], end=' ')
    print('\n', end='')
```
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **Computing LCM**: For each test case, it computes the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
3. **Distributing Coins**: It distributes the coins such that the total bet is \( \frac{m}{k_i} \) for each \( k_i \).
4. **Validation**: It checks if the total bet is less than the LCM. If not, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the distribution of coins.

#### Validation Using Annotations:
- **Initial State**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then each test case.
- **State after Reading Multipliers**: After reading the multipliers, it computes the LCM using `func_2`.
- **State after Distributing Coins**: It distributes the coins such that the total bet is \( \frac{m}{k_i} \) for each \( k_i \).
- **State after Validation**: It checks if the total bet is less than the LCM. If not, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the distribution of coins.

#### Example Test Case:
Consider the example test case:
- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  3 2 7
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  27 41 12
  ```

- **Program Execution**:
  - Compute LCM: \( \text{LCM}(3, 2, 7) = 42 \)
  - Distribute coins: \( \frac{42}{3} = 14 \), \( \frac{42}{2} = 21 \), \( \frac{42}{7} = 6 \)
  - Total bet: \( 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 \) (which is less than 42)

The program correctly computes the LCM and distributes the coins such that the total bet is less than the LCM for each winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment was inaccurate because the program does solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
