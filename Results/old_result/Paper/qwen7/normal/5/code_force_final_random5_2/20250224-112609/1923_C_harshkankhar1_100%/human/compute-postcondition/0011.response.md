Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is 1, `b[1]` is 2, `b[2]` is 3, `b[3]` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a[i]` is greater than 1**

Explanation: The code updates `b[i]` to the value of `b[i - 1] + x`. Given that `i` is 3, `b[3]` is calculated as `b[2] + x`, which is `3 + 1 = 4`. However, since the initial value of `b[2]` was 3, the updated value of `b[3]` is 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
