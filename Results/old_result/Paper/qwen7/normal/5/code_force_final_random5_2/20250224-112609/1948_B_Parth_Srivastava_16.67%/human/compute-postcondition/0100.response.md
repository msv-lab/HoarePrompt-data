Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `c` is a list containing all elements from the list `a` that meet the specified conditions, `n` is the length of `c`, and `d` is a sorted version of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `d = sorted(c)` sorts the list `c` in ascending order and assigns the sorted list to the variable `d`. The values of `i`, `c`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states.
