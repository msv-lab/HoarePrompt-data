Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is an input string**.

The code `a = input()` assigns the value of the input (which is a string) to the variable `a`. The other variables remain unchanged with their initial states.
