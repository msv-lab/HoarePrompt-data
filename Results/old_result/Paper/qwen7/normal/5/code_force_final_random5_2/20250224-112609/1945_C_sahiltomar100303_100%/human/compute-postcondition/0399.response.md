Output State: **`left` is now `left - 2`, `leftZero` is now less than \((left + 1) // 2 - 1\), and `rightOne` must be less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\)**.

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Initially, `leftZero` must be less than \((left + 1) // 2\). After decrementing `leftZero` by 1, it must now be less than \((left + 1) // 2 - 1\). The value of `left` is updated to `left - 1` from the initial state, and now it is further decremented by 1. The condition for `rightOne` remains unchanged.
