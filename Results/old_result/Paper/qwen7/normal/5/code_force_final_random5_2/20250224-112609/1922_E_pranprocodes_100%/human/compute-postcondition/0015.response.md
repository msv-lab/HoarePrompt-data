Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be different from 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing `-100000000`, `x` is decreased by 1.**

The value of `x` is decreased by 1, but since the initial value of `x` is not specified beyond "must be different from 1", we keep the condition that `x` must be different from 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
