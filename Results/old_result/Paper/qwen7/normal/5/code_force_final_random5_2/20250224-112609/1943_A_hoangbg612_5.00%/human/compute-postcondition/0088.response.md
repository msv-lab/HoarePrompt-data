Output State: **`cur` is 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `num` is the second element of `N`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement in the given code, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply indicates that execution would exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional structure. All the variables retain their initial states, and the `break` statement itself is noted as causing an exit from the most internal loop or if statement.
