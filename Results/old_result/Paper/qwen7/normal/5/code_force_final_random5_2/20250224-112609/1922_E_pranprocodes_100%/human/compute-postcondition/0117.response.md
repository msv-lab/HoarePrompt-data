Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 3, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999 and may be increased by 1, `min` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999 and may be increased by 1, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, and `x` must not be equal to 1; if `x` is 0, `max` is decreased by 1; if `x` is 2, `min` is increased by 1 and `ans` now includes the value of `min`.**

Explanation: The code `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Initially, `t` was 1, so after executing the code, `t` becomes 2. The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they were not directly affected by the code.
