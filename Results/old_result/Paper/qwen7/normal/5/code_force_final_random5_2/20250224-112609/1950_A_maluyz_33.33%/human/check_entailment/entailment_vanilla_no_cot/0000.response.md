Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in its conditions for determining whether the digits form a "STAIR" or "PEAK". Specifically:

1. The condition `elif a == b == c:` will catch cases where all three digits are equal, but it should not be used to determine that the digits do not form a "STAIR" or "PEAK". Instead, this should be handled separately.
2. The condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` is checking if `b` is the maximum digit, which is not sufficient to determine if the digits form a "PEAK". It should check both `a < b > c` and `a < b < c`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This corrected version correctly identifies "STAIR", "PEAK", and "NONE" based on the given conditions.
