Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `match_a_b` or `i`, but it indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one.
