Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one value, `cnt` is decreased by 1 if it was greater than or equal to 2, `res` remains unchanged if `cnt` was less than 2, otherwise `res` is increased by either `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` or `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `total_count` is increased by the original value of `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increases the value of `total_count` by the current value of `cnt`. The postcondition mentioned does not directly affect the value of `total_count` but rather provides conditions under which `res` might be updated. Since `total_count` is updated by adding the current value of `cnt`, the only direct change is to `total_count`. The conditions related to `res` and `cnt` are not immediately applicable here as they depend on the value of `cnt` before this line of code is executed.
