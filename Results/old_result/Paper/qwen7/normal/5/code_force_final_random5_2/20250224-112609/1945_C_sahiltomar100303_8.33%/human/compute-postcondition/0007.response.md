Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0**.

The code initializes `leftOne` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `rightZero` remain unchanged from their initial states.
