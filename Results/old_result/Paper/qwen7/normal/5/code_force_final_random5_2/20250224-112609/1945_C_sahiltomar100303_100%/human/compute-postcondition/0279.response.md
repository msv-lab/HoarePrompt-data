Output State: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - right`, and `trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - (n - right)`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the condition `right < n` will no longer be satisfied because `right` will be equal to `n`. The loop will stop executing when `right` reaches `n`. During each iteration, `right` is incremented by 1, so eventually, it will reach `n`. The variables `tleftZero` and `trightZero` will be updated based on the number of '0's encountered during the loop, and similarly, `tleftOne` and `trightOne` will be updated based on the number of '1's. The final values of `tleftZero` and `trightZero` will reflect the total count of '0's encountered from the start up to the point where `right` equals `n`. Similarly, `trightOne` will reflect the count of '1's from the start up to the point where `right` equals `n`.
