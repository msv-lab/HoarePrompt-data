Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all calculated values from the loop, `num_of_lens` is the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes `num_of_lens` as an empty dictionary. This means that all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `res`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `num_list`, `test_cases`, and `results` retain their initial values, and `n` remains an input integer.
