### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description**: We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates over all integers \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2y \ge x \), it returns \( y \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the last value of `max_val`, which is initialized to 1.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates backward from \( x-1 \) to 2.
   - It checks divisibility and the condition \( 2y \ge x \).
   - If both conditions are met, it returns \( y \).
   - Otherwise, it updates `max_val` with the current \( y \).

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \( x = 10 \):
     - \( y = 9 \): \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\)
     - \( y = 8 \): \(\gcd(10, 8) + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10\)
     - \( y = 7 \): \(\gcd(10, 7) + 7 = 1 + 7 = 8\)
     - ...
     - \( y = 5 \): \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\)
   - The function will return \( y = 9 \) or \( y = 8 \) because they satisfy the condition \( 2y \ge x \).

5. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not always find the optimal \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - This is true because the program only considers \( y \) values where \( x \% y == 0 \) and \( 2y \ge x \). It does not consider other values of \( y \) that might maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not always find the optimal \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
