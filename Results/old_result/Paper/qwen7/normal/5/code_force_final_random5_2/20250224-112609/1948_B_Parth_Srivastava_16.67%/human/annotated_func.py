#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.
def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)

                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)

    #State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `c` is a list containing all elements from the list `a` that meet the specified conditions, `n` is the length of `c`, and `c` is sorted in a specific order based on the conditions inside the loop.
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `c` is a list containing all elements from the list `a` that meet the specified conditions, `n` is the length of `c`, `d` is a sorted version of `c`, and `b` now contains either the element `1` or `0` depending on whether `c` is already sorted or not.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it filters the list a based on specific conditions, sorts the filtered list, and checks if the filtered list is already sorted. If the filtered list is sorted, it appends 1 to the list b; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return anything directly but updates the list b with the results.
