Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n`
- `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`
- `ul` is equal to `ur` + 2
- The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = n` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` does not change within the loop; it remains constant throughout the loop iterations.
   - Therefore, the condition `n <= len(res)` must still hold true.

3. **Variable `ul`:**
   - `ul` is defined as `ur + 2`.
   - This relationship does not change within the loop.

4. **Variable `r[a[i] - 1]`:**
   - The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged during the loop execution.

### Adjusting the State
- **`i`**: Since `i` starts at `n` and increments by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.
- **`n`**: Remains the same.
- **`ul`**: Remains the same.
- **`r[a[i] - 1]`**: Remains unchanged.

### New State
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 2, and the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 2, and the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.**
