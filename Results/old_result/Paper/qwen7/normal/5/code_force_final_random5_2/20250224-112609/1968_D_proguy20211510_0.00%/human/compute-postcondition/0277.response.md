Output State: **`i` is within the range of `range(len(pres))` and equals `i + 1`; `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `ptsb` is updated with the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`; `ptss` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` to the list `ptsb`. Since `i` is within the range of `range(len(pres))` and equals `i + 1`, and `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, the value of `ptsb` is updated accordingly. The value of `ptss` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
