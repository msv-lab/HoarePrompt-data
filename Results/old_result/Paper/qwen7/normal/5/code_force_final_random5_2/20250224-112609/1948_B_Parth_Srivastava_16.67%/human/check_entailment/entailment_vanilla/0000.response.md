Reasoning:

1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
2. The main issues are:
   - The `func_1` function is not being called with the correct parameters.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It does not properly handle the splitting of numbers into their constituent digits and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.
   - The program initializes an empty list `b` but does not append any values to it.
   - The program assumes `b` is populated with results from `func_1`, but since `func_1` is not called correctly, `b` remains empty.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
