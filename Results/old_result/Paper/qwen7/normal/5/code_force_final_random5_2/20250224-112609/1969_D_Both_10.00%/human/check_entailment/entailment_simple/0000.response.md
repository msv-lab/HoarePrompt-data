### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
   - `func_3` calculates the sum of certain values based on the conditions provided.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program processes each test case.
   - It initializes necessary variables and structures like `arr`, `k_arr`, and `temp_pop`.
   - It sorts the items based on their `b_i` values.
   - It uses a min-heap (`k_arr`) to keep track of the smallest `k` items.
   - It iterates through the sorted items and calculates the potential profit based on whether Bob takes items for free or not.
   - The logic seems to handle the scenario where Bob can take up to `k` items for free and the remaining items are sold to him at their respective prices.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The function `func_3` is used to calculate a specific sum based on the input arrays `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - The function correctly sums the first elements of the tuples in `sec_arr` and adds the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all sublists in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is non-negative.
   - This part of the logic appears to be correctly implemented.

4. **Overall Structure**:
   - The overall structure of the program is logical and follows the problem statement.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and the logic, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution to the problem. The main logic and the helper functions are correctly defined and used.

### Correctness:
**True**
