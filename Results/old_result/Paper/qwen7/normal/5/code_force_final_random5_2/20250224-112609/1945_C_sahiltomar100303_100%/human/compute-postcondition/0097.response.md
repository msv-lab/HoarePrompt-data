Output State: **`right` must be less than `n` and the current value of `s[right]` is '0'; `tleftZero` is increased by 1; either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`.**

The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `right` must still be less than `n` and the current value of `s[right]` is '0', and the condition involving `tleftZero` remains either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`.
