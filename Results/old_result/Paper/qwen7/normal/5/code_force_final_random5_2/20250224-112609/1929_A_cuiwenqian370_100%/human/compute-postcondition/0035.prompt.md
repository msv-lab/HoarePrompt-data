Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` must be exactly 0, `index` is increased by the sum of all `n` values encountered during the loop iterations, `result` is the last return value of `func_1(array)` computed during the loop, `results` is a list containing all the `result` values computed during each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because it was decremented with each iteration until it reached 0. The `index` variable will have been incremented by the total number of elements processed (sum of all `n` values). Each `result` computed during the loop is appended to the `results` list, making `results` contain the outcomes of all iterations.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be initialized to the sum of all `n` values plus 1, `index` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `result` is the last return value of `func_1(array)` computed during the loop

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be initialized to the sum of all `n` values plus 1, `index` is 0, `results` must contain at least one element, `result` is the first element in `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be initialized to the sum of all `n` values plus 1, `index` is 1, `results` must contain at least two elements, `result` is the second element in `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
