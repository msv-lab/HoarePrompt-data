### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` equal to zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 \le i \le n-1`) and performing the following assignments:
     - `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`

2. **Analyzing the Given Functions:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
     - It returns `False` if any element is non-zero, otherwise `True`.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function attempts to reduce the array elements to zero using the specified operation.
     - It iterates through the array from index `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
     - For each index `i`, it checks if the conditions allow the operation to be applied (`list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`).
     - If the conditions are met, it performs the operation and updates the array.
     - If at any point an index `i-1` is found to be non-zero after the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns.
     - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly implement the operation and check if the array can be made zero.
   - The function iterates through the array and applies the operation whenever possible, ensuring that the conditions are met.
   - If the operation cannot be applied at any point (i.e., `list[i-1]` becomes zero), it immediately prints 'NO'.
   - After the loop, it uses `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify the example provided:
     - For the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`:
       - Applying the operation at `i=4` results in `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=3` results in `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=2` results in `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=4` results in `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
       - The function correctly identifies that it is possible to make all elements zero.
   - For the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`:
     - No operation can be applied, so the function prints 'NO'.
   - For the array `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`:
     - Applying the operation at `i=2` results in `[0, 0, 2, 2, 1]`.
     - Applying the operation at `i=3` results in `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`.
     - Applying the operation at `i=3` again results in `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`.
     - Applying the operation at `i=4` results in `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
     - The function correctly identifies that it is possible to make all elements zero.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider the array `[5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]`:
     - No operation can be applied, so the function prints 'NO'.
   - Consider the array `[1, 2, 7, 2]`:
     - No operation can be applied, so the function prints 'NO'.
   - Consider the array `[7, 1, 0]`:
     - No operation can be applied, so the function prints 'NO'.
   - Consider the array `[1, 1, 1, 1]`:
     - No operation can be applied, so the function prints 'NO'.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided functions correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.
   - The function iterates through the array and applies the operation whenever possible, ensuring that the conditions are met.
   - After the loop, it uses `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
