Based on the initial state provided:

- `h1` is one of the strings '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '01' to '15'.
- `m1` is equal to `m`.
- `time` is either 'AM', 'PM', or an empty string.
- `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input.
- `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input.
- `num_iterations - 1` is the number of remaining iterations, but this value is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

Here, the `sep=''` argument in the `print` function means that there will be no separator between the arguments. Therefore, the values of `h1`, `m`, and `time` will be printed directly next to each other.

Given the values of `h1`, `m`, and `time` as described, the output will be:
Output: **h1 : m time**
