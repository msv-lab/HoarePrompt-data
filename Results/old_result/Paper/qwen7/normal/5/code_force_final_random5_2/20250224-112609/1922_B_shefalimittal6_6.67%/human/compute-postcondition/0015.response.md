Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is a value from `num_of_lens.values()` and the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the original value of `res` plus the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to its current value. Since `cnt` is a value from `num_of_lens.values()` and is greater than or equal to 3, `math.comb(cnt, 3)` calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items. The other variables remain unchanged.
