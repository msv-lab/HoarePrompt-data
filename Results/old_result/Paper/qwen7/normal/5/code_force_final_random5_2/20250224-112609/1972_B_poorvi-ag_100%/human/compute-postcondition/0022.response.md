Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input from the user, `results` is a list containing 'no'**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `results` now contains the element `'no'`.
