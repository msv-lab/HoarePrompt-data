Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1 divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000, `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides the value of `x` by 2 using integer division (//), which means it rounds down to the nearest whole number. Since `x` is an input integer greater than 1, after the division, `x` becomes an integer greater than 0.5 but less than or equal to 1 (if `x` was exactly 2, it would become 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
