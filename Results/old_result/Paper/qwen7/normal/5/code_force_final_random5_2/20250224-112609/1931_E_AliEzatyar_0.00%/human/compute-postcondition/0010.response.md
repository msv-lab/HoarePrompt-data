Output State: **`counter` is 0, `num` has at least one element, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, and `num[i]` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or the most internal if statement we are inside. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable's value, the values of `counter`, `num`, `i`, and the condition that `num[i]` is not '0' remain unchanged.
