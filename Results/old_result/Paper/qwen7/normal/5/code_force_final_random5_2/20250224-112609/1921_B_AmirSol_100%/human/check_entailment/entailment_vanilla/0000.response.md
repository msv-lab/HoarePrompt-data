Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`).
2. The given program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the number of cats that need to be added and removed to achieve the desired state.
3. The function counts the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`).
4. The logic used in the function is correct:
   - `cats_to_add` is calculated by counting the positions where there is no cat initially but there should be one in the desired state.
   - `cats_to_remove` is calculated by counting the positions where there is a cat initially but there should not be one in the desired state.
5. The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of these two counts because each operation can either add or remove one cat, and moving a cat from one box to another is considered an operation.
6. The main loop correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1` and printing the result.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
