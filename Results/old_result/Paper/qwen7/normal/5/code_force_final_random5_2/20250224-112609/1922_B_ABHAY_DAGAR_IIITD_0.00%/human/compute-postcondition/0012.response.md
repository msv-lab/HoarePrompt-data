Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in num_list:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `num_list`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the key `x` with a value that is either 1 (if `x` is not previously in `num_of_lens`) or 1 more than its original value (if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`).
   - `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one element where `x` is the first element.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the first element in `num_list`, the loop will iterate over `x`.
   - After processing `x`, `x` will be removed from `num_list` because it has been processed.
   - The value of `x` in `num_of_lens` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `num_list` will lose its first element, so it will no longer contain `x`.
   - `num_of_lens[x]` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the key `x` with a value that is 2 (since `x` was already in `num_of_lens`), and `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one element excluding the first element, which is `x`.**
