Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After executing the if-else block, the dictionary `M` will map each unique integer from the list `N` to the number of consecutive occurrences of that integer where no integer in between is greater than `cur + 1`. If no such sequence exists, `M[cur]` will hold the count of consecutive occurrences of `cur` until the end of the list. If the sum of all values in `M` equals `S`, `cur` is increased by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0 and `cur` is 0, as `M[i]` is always less than or equal to `i` when `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `cur` is 0. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `cur` is 0. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
