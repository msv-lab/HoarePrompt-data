Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is decreased by 1.**

In this case, the code `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. Since `t`, `n`, and `f` are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split remains valid. The only change is that `k` is now one less than its original value.
