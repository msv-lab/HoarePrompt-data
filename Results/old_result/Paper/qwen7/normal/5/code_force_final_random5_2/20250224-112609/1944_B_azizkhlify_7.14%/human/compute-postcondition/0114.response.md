Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2
   - `x` is an integer
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - `ur` is equal to `ur` + 4
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` remains the same
   - If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 2 * n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop starts with `i = n` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `2 * n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is `n + 1` and the loop condition is `i < 2 * n`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` will be updated in the loop body, but we don't know its exact value yet.
   - `x` is an integer and remains unchanged.
   - `a` is a list of integers and remains unchanged.
   - `ur` is updated by adding 4 in the loop body, but we don't know its exact value yet.
   - `ul` remains unchanged and does not affect the loop continuation.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` will be updated but we cannot determine its exact value without the loop body.
   - `x` remains an integer.
   - `a` remains a list of integers.
   - `ur` will be updated by adding 4, but we cannot determine its exact value without the loop body.
   - `ul` remains unchanged.

Given the constraints and the information provided, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
**`i` is `n + 2`, `n` remains the same, `r[a[i] - 1]` is updated but unknown, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `ur` is updated but unknown, `ul` remains unchanged.**

However, since we need to provide a specific state format, we can focus on the key variables `i` and `n`:

**State:**
**`i` is `n + 2`, `n` remains the same.**
