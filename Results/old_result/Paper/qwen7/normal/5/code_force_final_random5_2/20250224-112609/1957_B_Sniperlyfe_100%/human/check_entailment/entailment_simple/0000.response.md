Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` for each case.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes a list `nums` of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, which is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1.
   - It then adjusts `k` by subtracting this value from `k`.
   - In the loop, it fills the rest of the list `nums` such that each subsequent element is either `nums[0] + 1` or `k` (if `k > 0`), ensuring the sum of the elements equals `k`.
   - Finally, it adds any remaining value of `k` to `nums[0]` and returns the list `nums`.

3. **Binary OR Operation Consideration**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all numbers in the list.
   - By setting the first element to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, the function ensures that this number has the maximum possible number of 1s for the given bit length of `k`.
   - Subsequent elements are either `nums[0] + 1` or `k` (if `k > 0`), which helps in maximizing the number of 1s in the OR operation without exceeding the sum constraint.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is very small, the function correctly handles the distribution of values to ensure the sum is met while maximizing the number of 1s in the OR operation.
   - If `k` is large enough to fill the entire list with `nums[0] + 1`, the function still ensures the sum is met and the number of 1s is maximized.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to satisfy both conditions: the sum of the elements should be `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR should be maximized.

Correctness: **True**
