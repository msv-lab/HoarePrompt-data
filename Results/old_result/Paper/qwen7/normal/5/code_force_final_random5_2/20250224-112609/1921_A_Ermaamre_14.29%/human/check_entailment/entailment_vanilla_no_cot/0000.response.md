Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic to determine which points form the sides of the square is flawed. Specifically, the program assumes that the points are ordered in a way that makes it easy to identify the sides, but this is not guaranteed by the problem statement. 

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Calculate all pairwise distances
        distances = []
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i + 1, 4):
                distance = ((points[i][0] - points[j][0]) ** 2 + (points[i][1] - points[j][1]) ** 2) ** 0.5
                distances.append(distance)
        
        # Identify the side length of the square
        side_length = min(distances)
        
        # Area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)

func()
```

This corrected program:
1. Collects all four points.
2. Calculates all pairwise distances between the points.
3. Identifies the smallest distance, which should be the side length of the square.
4. Computes and prints the area of the square.
