Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, but this is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made sorted by the specified operation. The function `func_2` reads input but uses `func_1` which only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to check if there exists a split point where the array can be split into two parts such that swapping them results in a non-decreasing array. The current implementation does not account for this logic.
