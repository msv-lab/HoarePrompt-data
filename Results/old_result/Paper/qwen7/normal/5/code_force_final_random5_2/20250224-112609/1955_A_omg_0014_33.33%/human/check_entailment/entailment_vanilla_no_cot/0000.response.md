Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts under the promotion. The current implementation compares the price of a single yogurt (`a`) with half the promotion price (`c/2`), which is not the correct approach. Instead, we need to calculate the total cost considering both the individual price and the promotional price for pairs of yogurts.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of pairs and remaining single yogurts
        pairs = n // 2
        singles = n % 2
        
        # Calculate the cost
        cost = pairs * b + singles * a
        
        print(cost)

```

This corrected function properly calculates the minimum cost by determining how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many single yogurts need to be bought at the regular price.
