Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the third character of `e`, `P` is 3 if `q` is '+', otherwise `P` is 2, and `M` is 2 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `P` is incremented by 1. Since `P` was initially 2 if `q` is '+' and 1 otherwise, after executing `P += 1`, `P` becomes 3 if `q` is '+' (since 2 + 1 = 3) and 2 if `q` is not '+'. All other variables remain unchanged.
