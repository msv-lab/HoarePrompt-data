Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `index` is increased by `n`, `array` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index - n` and of length `n`.**

Explanation: The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. The initial conditions state that `t` must be at least 1 and `array` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n`. After executing the code, `index` is updated to `index + n`, and the start of the array remains `index - n` since the list length hasn't changed.
