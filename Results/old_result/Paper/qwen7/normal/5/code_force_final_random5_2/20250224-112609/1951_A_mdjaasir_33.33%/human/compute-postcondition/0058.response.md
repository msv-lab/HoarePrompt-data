Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string indicating whether the start and end directory names satisfy the condition that start is less than or equal to end.**

Note: The provided code snippet does not include any parameters in the function definition, and the problem description mentions constraints on `start` and `end` but does not reflect these in the function signature. Given the format requirement, the function is described as accepting no parameters and checking the relationship between hypothetical `start` and `end` values.
