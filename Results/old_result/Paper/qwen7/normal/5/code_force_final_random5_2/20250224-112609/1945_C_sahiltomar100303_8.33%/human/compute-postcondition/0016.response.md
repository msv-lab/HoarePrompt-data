Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` must be at least 1, `leftZero` is 2, `tleftZero` is 1 + 1.**

The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Since `tleftZero` was initially 1 (from the precondition), it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
