Output State: **`leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `trightZero` is the total number of zeros in the entire string `s`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `trightOne` is the total number of ones in the entire string `s`, `tleftZero` is the cumulative count of zeros seen throughout the loop, `tleftOne` is the cumulative count of ones seen throughout the loop, and `left` is set to `mid`.**

The code simply initializes `leftMove` to 0 without affecting any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `mid`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightOne`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, and `left` remain unchanged from their initial states.
