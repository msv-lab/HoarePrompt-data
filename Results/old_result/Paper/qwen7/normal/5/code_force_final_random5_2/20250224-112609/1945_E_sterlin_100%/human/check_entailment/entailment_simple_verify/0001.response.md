### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at the `l`-th position when it ends.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is defined with the following steps:
   - Initialize `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
   - While `r - l > 1`, calculate `m = ⌊(r + l) / 2⌋`.
   - If `p_m <= x`, set `l = m`. Otherwise, set `r = m`.

3. **Goal**: We need to ensure that `p_l == x` after the binary search is executed. This means we need to place `x` in the position where the binary search would find it.

4. **Swapping Strategy**:
   - **Case 1**: If `x` is already in the permutation, no swaps are needed.
   - **Case 2**: If `x` is not in the permutation, we need to find the closest element to `x` and swap it with `x`. After the first swap, we might need to swap again to ensure `x` is in the correct position.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code correctly reads the input and constructs a dictionary `num_indx` to map each number to its index in the permutation.
   - The code then performs the binary search on the permutation to find the position where `x` should be placed.
   - The logic to determine the necessary swaps is present:
     - If `p[left] == x`, no swaps are needed.
     - If `x` is not in the permutation (`not seen[x - 1]`), one swap is needed to bring `x` into the permutation.
     - If `x` is not found in the first swap, a second swap is needed to ensure `x` is in the correct position.

6. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - **First Swap**:
     - If `x` is not in the permutation, the code identifies the first element that is not seen (`temp[0]`) and swaps it with `x`.
   - **Second Swap**:
     - If the first swap does not place `x` in the correct position, the code swaps `x` with the element at `left + 1`.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The code correctly handles all cases where the number of swaps needed is 0, 1, or 2.
   - The logic ensures that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position after the swaps.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at the correct position. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
