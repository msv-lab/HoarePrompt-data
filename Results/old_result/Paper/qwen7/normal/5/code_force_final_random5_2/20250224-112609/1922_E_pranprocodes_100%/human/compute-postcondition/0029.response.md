The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is either 0 or 0.5. For the loop to be executed one more time, `x` must be 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `x` is 0.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is 0, `max` is 99999899, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing 99999999, `t` is 1**
