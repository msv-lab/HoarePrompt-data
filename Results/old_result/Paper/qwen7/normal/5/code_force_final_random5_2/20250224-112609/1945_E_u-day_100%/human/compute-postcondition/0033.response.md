Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `low` stays as 0, `high` is now `mid`, `mid` itself is unchanged as it is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2` (which is the same as before since `high` just became `mid`), `pos` remains -1, `i` is still 9, `n` is still a positive integer, `k` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is still the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` still contains the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`.
