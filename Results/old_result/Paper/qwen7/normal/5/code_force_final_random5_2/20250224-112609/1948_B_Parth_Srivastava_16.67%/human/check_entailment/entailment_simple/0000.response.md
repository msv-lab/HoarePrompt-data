Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for splitting numbers greater than 10 into their constituent digits and reinserting them in the array is not properly handled.
2. The main issues are:
   - The function `func_1()` does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits.
   - The variable `b` is used to store results but is not initialized before use.
   - The logic for determining if the array can be made sorted is flawed because it only checks if the final list `c` is sorted, which does not account for the operations allowed in the problem statement.
3. The program should:
   - Read the input values for each test case.
   - Split numbers greater than 10 into their constituent digits and reinsert them.
   - Check if the resulting array can be sorted through these operations.
4. Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
