Output State: `arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to the index where `ans` was last updated, `o_r` is the final count of 1s minus the final count of 0s seen so far, `z_r` is the final count of 0s minus the final count of 1s seen so far, `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n/2` and `pos`, and both `o_l` and `z_l` are the cumulative counts of 1s and 0s seen throughout the entire execution of the loop. The value of `ans` will be the smallest `pos` where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` holds true, or it will remain unchanged if no such `pos` is found during the loop's execution.
