Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.

In natural language: The value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases, must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute all its iterations. Since the loop runs as long as `t` is greater than 0, and no operations inside the loop modify `t`, the final state of `t` will still be greater than 0 after all iterations have completed.
