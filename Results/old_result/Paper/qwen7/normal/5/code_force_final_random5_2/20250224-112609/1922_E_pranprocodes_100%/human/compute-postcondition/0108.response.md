The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` must not be equal to 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `x` must still not be equal to 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `x` must not be equal to 1.

State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, `min` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, and `x` must not be equal to 1**
