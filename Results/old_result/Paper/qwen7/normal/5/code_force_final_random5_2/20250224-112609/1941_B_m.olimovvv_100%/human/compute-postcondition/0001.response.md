Output State: **`a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of an integer input from the user. The initial state includes the fact that `a` is assigned the value of an integer input using `input()`, which means `a` now holds the integer value entered by the user. All other variables remain in their initial state, but since no other variables are mentioned or modified, they are not included in the output state.
