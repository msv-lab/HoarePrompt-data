Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in this case is `j`. The other variables mentioned are `eta`, `j`, `n`, and the condition involving `q[j]`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n-1` and `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - **`j`**: Since the loop runs from `0` to `n`, the next value of `j` would be `n` (if `n > 0`).
   - **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, it stays the same.
   - **`eta`**: The value of `eta` depends on the condition `if q[j] > 0, then eta is updated to include `j`. Since `j` was `n-1` in the previous iteration, we need to check if `q[n-1] > 0`. If it is true, `eta` will include `n-1`.

Given the conditions:
- `j` will be `n` in the next iteration.
- `n` remains the same.
- `eta` will include `n-1` if `q[n-1] > 0`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `q[n-1]` or its impact on `eta`, we will keep `eta` as an empty list if `q[n-1] <= 0`, or include `n-1` in `eta` if `q[n-1] > 0`.

However, based on the provided information, we can only adjust the states of `j` and `n` since `eta`'s state depends on the loop body execution which is not provided.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**.
