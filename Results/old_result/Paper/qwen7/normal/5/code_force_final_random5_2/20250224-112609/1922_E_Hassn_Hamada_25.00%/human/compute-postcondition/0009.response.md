Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given by:
   \[
   (1 << size + 1) - 1 \leq number
   \]
   This condition checks if the value of `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`.

2. **Current States:**
   - `number` must be at least 15.
   - `size` is 4.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition with Current States:**
   - Calculate `(1 << size + 1) - 1` with `size = 4`:
     \[
     (1 << (4 + 1)) - 1 = (1 << 5) - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31
     \]
   - Check if `31 <= number`:
     - Since `number` must be at least 15, and `31` is greater than `15`, the current condition `31 <= number` is true.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must still hold true after the next iteration.
   - The loop will increment `size` by 1 (assuming the loop body increments `size`).
   - After incrementing `size` by 1, `size` becomes `5`.
   - Recalculate `(1 << size + 1) - 1` with `size = 5`:
     \[
     (1 << (5 + 1)) - 1 = (1 << 6) - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63
     \]
   - The new condition becomes `63 <= number`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - The variable `size` must be incremented to `5`.
   - The condition `63 <= number` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`number` must be at least 63, `size` is 5**
