Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the elements of the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `N` is sorted. This step is unnecessary for solving the problem since the order of elements does not affect the MEX calculation directly. However, sorting might help in some specific scenarios, but it is not necessary here.

3. **Initialization**:
   - A variable `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the counts of each number in the array.

4. **Processing the Array**:
   - The program iterates through each number in the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it updates the count in the dictionary `M` and sets `cur` to `num`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - The program checks if the sum of counts in the dictionary `M` equals the size of the array `S`.
   - If true, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from 0 to `cur` to find the smallest index `i` where the count of `i` is less than or equal to `i`. This index `i` is the final MEX value.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **MEX Calculation Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. The program tries to find the smallest number that is not present in the array by counting occurrences and checking conditions. However, it does not correctly simulate the game rules where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements.

2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice picks elements and appends them to `c` and removes them from `a`.
   - Bob only removes elements from `a`.
   - The program does not simulate these rules properly. It simply counts occurrences without considering whose turn it is or how the elements are appended to `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy involves ensuring that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it. The program does not account for this strategic behavior.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem according to the game rules and optimal strategies. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
