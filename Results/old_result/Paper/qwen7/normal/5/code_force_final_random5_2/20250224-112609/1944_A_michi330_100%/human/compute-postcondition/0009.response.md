Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^3\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < t`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute once if `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Conditions for No Changes:**
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, no changes are made.
   - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, no changes are made.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged unless it is explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, `t` stays as it is.
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be 1.
- `t` remains the same (greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^3\)).
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
