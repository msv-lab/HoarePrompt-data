Output State: **`count` is 0, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer representing the length of the string expression such that 1 <= length <= 5000.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. No changes are made to the `expression` or `length`. Therefore, the `expression` remains unchanged as a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `length` retains its original value representing the length of the string `expression`.
