Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state provides the conditions for the variables and objects but does not affect the execution of the `print('YES')` statement directly. The statement itself prints the string 'YES', regardless of the values of other variables like `no`, `c`, `x`, `a`, and `b`. Therefore, the output is simply 'YES'.
