Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, and the current element (`cur`) is greater than or equal to `num`; `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Since `cur` is the index of the current element in `N` and is greater than or equal to `num`, the only change is to the value of `M[cur]`. The initial conditions about `N` and `cur` remain unchanged.
