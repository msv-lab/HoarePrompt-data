Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, and `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `y4`. Additionally, `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, and `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`.**

In this case, the code calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
