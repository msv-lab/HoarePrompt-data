Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with an integer default factory. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
