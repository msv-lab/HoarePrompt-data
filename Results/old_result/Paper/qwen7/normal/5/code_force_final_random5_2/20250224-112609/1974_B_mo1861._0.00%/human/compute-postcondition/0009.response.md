Output State: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` maps to the character 'a' minus its position from the end of the string `b` in ASCII, `i` is the total number of unique characters in `b`, and `c` is the last unique character in the sorted form of `b`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `char_map` will contain a mapping for each unique character in the string `b`. The value for each character `c` in `char_map` will be calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of `c` in the sorted unique characters of `b`, starting from 0. The variable `i` will be equal to the total count of unique characters in `b`, and `c` will be the last unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
