Output State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 0)**

Explanation: The code initializes the tuple `size_overlap` with the values `(0, 0)`. Since no other operations are performed on `size_overlap` or any other variables, the only change is in the initialization of `size_overlap`. The initial state of `number` being a positive integer between 2 and \(10^{18}\) and `sequence` being a list of integers within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) remains unchanged.
