Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for c in b:`. This means the loop variable `c` is iterating over the characters in the string `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` maps to the character 'a'.
   - `i` is 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `char_map[c]` is 'a' (this is a condition that must hold true for the loop to execute).

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one character in `b` that can be iterated over.
   - Since `char_map[c]` must be 'a' for the loop to execute, and `char_map` is defined such that every unique character in `b` maps to 'a', this condition is inherently satisfied as long as `b` is non-empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `b`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `b` must contain at least one character.
   - The value of `i` is not relevant to the loop execution, so it can remain as `i` is 1.
   - The condition `char_map[c]` being 'a' is already satisfied by the definition of `char_map`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `b` must contain at least one character.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`b` must contain at least one character, `i` is 1**
