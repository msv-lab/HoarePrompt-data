Reasoning:
1. The program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement.
2. It checks if the letters in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. It checks if the digits in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. It ensures that there is no digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking for any instance where a letter is followed by a digit.
5. The logic in the function `func_1` matches the requirements stated in the problem description.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
