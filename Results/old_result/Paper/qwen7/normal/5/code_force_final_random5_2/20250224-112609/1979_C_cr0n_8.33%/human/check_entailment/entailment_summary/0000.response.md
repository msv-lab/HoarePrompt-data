Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets**: The program calculates `vprod` as the product of all elements in `vals` divided by each individual element. This does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Feasibility**: The logic for checking if a solution exists (`if den <= 0`) is flawed. The variable `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`, which does not directly relate to whether the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string, which might not always satisfy the condition that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

Given the problem requirements, the program should:
- Calculate the total amount of coins to be bet.
- Ensure that for each outcome, the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for that outcome.

The provided program does not achieve this. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
