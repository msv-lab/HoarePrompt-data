Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 3] - c[len(c) - 3])`**.

Explanation: The code updates `t2` to be the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]` where `j` is now 3 (previously `j` was either 2 or 3). Since `j` is set to 3, `t2` becomes `abs(a[len(a) - 3] - c[len(c) - 3])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
