Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, coord is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`**

The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are input integers, they are added to the list as a tuple. The values of `i` and the nature of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
