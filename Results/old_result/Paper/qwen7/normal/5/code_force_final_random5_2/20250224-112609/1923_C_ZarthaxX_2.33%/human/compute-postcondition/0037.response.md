Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is defined as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `q` is a variable that must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `l` and `r` are assigned values from input split by space.
- `sumInRange` is defined as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since no specific values for `l`, `r`, `ones`, or `sum` are provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `onesInRange` or `sumInRange`. However, the print statement itself does not depend on these values; it only prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
