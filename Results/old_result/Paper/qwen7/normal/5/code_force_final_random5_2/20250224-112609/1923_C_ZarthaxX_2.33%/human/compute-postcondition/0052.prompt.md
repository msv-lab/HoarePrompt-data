Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ones[i]` will contain the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to each index `i`, and `sum[i]` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index `i`, adjusted by subtracting 1 at each step.

In more detail:
- `ones[i]` will be the total number of 1s in the `nums` list from index 0 to index `i`.
- `sum[i]` will be the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` from index 0 to index `i`, but each element is decremented by 1 before adding to the cumulative sum.

This means that after the loop completes, `ones[n]` will give the total count of 1s in `nums`, and `sum[n]` will give the adjusted cumulative sum of the elements in `nums`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer from input; `r` is an integer from input; `sumInRange` is the sum of integers from index `l-1` to `r`; `onesInRange` is the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]` if `l` is not equal to `r`. If the condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange) <= sumInRange` is satisfied, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` must be greater than or equal to 0, `l` and `r` are assigned the values from input split by space, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, the program continues under this condition. Otherwise, the program continues under the same conditions without any changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` and `r` are integers from input split by space, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
