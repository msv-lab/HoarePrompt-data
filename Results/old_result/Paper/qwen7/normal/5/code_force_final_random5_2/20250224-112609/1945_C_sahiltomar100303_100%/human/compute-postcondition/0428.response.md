Output State: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is either 1 or 2, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `right` must be less than `n`, `trightZero` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `trightOne` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. Since `leftZero` was either 0 or 1, after incrementing, it will now be either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the precondition still hold true.
