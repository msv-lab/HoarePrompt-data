Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `_` (which is a dummy variable) and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string.

4. **Effect of the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition provided, we know that:
   - If `cnt1` (the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`) is greater than 2 and even, `cnt1` remains unchanged.
   - If `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or odd, it is set to 0.
   - If `cnt1` is 1, it remains 1.
   - If `cnt1` is greater than 1, it is set to 0 if '11' does not exist in `s` or if the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is odd.

5. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` becomes `t - 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `s` remains the same.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string**.
