Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then processes it. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Parsing Data**: It correctly parses the number of test cases (`t`) and the details of each test case (length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`).

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It extracts all unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - **Mapping Characters**: It creates a mapping where each character is paired with its symmetric counterpart from the sorted list of unique characters.
   - **Decoding**: It uses this mapping to decode the entire encoded string.

4. **Output**: It prints the decoded string for each test case.

Given that the logic accurately follows the steps required for decoding and handles the input and output as specified, the program is correct.
