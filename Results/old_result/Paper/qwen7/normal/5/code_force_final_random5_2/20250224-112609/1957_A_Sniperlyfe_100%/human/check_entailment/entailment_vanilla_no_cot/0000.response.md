Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the number of regular polygons by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3, which is incorrect. This approach assumes that every set of three sticks of the same length can form a triangle, but it doesn't account for the possibility of forming other types of polygons (e.g., squares, pentagons, etc.) with more than three sides.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the stick lengths and then determine how many complete sets of that GCD can be formed from the frequencies of the stick lengths. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the GCD of all stick lengths
    polygon_side_length = reduce(gcd, arr)
    
    # Count how many complete polygons can be formed
    count = sum(v // polygon_side_length for v in arr.count(polygon_side_length) for _ in range(polygon_side_length))
    
    print(count // len(arr))
```

This program calculates the GCD of all stick lengths and then determines how many complete polygons can be formed using that GCD. It ensures that no stick is used more than once in multiple polygons.
