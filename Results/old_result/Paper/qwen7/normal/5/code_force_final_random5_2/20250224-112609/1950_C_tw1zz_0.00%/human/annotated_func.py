#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `h1` will be one of the following strings: '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12'. `m1` will be equal to the original `m` value. The variable `time` will be either 'AM' or 'PM', depending on the value of `h`. If `h` is '12' or '09', `time` will be 'AM'; otherwise, it will be 'PM'. Both `h` and `m` will be the last time values provided by the user as inputs, and the number of remaining iterations will be 0.
    #
    #This means that after processing all the inputs, the final printed time will reflect the converted 12-hour format with AM/PM designation based on the original 24-hour format input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple time inputs in the 24-hour format and converts them to the 12-hour format with AM/PM designation. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of time inputs, followed by `t` lines of time strings in the format "hh:mm". For each input, it converts the hour part from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and determines whether the time is in the morning (AM) or afternoon (PM). Finally, it prints the converted time for each input.
