### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
- If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, it uses the condition `any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))` to check if there is at least one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element.
- If such a pair exists, it returns 'No', otherwise it returns 'Yes'.

This function does not correctly handle the problem requirements because it only checks if the array is already sorted, not if it can be made sorted by splitting and swapping parts.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It correctly handles the reading and processing of multiple test cases, but the logic in `func_1` is flawed.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`:
- The function `func_1` would return 'Yes' because the array is not already sorted, but it does not check if it can be made sorted by splitting and swapping parts.
- According to the problem statement, the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing: `[1, 1, 4, 5]` and `[1, 4]` can be swapped to form `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, which is not sorted. However, the function `func_1` would still return 'Yes' because it only checks if the array is already sorted.

#### Correctness of the Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not handle the problem requirements properly. The function only checks if the array is already sorted, not if it can be made sorted by splitting and swapping parts. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient according to the problem statement.
