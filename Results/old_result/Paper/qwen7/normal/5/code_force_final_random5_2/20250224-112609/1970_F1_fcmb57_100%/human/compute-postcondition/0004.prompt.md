You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a 2D list of strings, where each string contains M characters and there are N such strings. The list contains characters representing empty cells ('..'), players ('R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9'), goals ('RG', 'BG'), and the Quaffle ('.Q'). Additionally, the function takes a list of actions, where each action is a string describing the entity performing the action and the action itself (e.g., 'B2 U' for player B2 moving up).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple containing x + dx and y + dy, where x and y are the elements of the tuple a, and dx and dy are the first and second elements of the tuple b respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, a and b, where a is a tuple containing two integers (x, y) representing coordinates, and b is a tuple containing two integers (dx, dy) representing the change in coordinates. The function returns a new tuple containing the updated coordinates (x + dx, y + dy).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing x + dx and y + dy, where x and y are the elements of the tuple a, and dx and dy are the first and second elements of the tuple b respectively.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
