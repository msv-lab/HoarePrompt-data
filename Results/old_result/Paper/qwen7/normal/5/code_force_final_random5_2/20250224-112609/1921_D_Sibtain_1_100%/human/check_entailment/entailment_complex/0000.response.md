Reasoning:

1. The program correctly handles the input format and constraints.
2. It checks if both arrays `a` and `c` are uniform and equal, in which case it prints `0` as the total difference.
3. It sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order, which is a good strategy to maximize the differences.
4. The logic for calculating the total difference `ans` seems correct. It iterates through the sorted arrays, ensuring that the maximum absolute difference is considered at each step.
5. The program correctly handles the edge case where `a` or `c` has only one element.
6. The final output is the total sum of the maximum absolute differences, which is calculated correctly.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
