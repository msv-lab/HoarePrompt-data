Output State: **`num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is increased by 1, and `cur` is equal to `num`; `M[cur]` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` sets the value of the element in the list `M` at the index `cur` to 1. Since `cur` was previously equal to `num`, and `cur` is now increased by 1, `cur` is now equal to `num`. Therefore, `M[num]` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
