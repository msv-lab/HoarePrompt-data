Based on the initial state provided, `start_year` will be adjusted in each iteration of the loop according to the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the `nums` list. By the end of the loop, `start_year` will reflect the final adjustment based on all elements in `nums`. The variable `x` will take on the value of the last index of the `nums` list after all iterations.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `start_year` is initially set to some value.
   - `nums` is a list of integers.
   - `x` takes on the value of the last index of `nums` after all iterations.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `x` in the range of `len(nums)`, `start_year` is updated using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - This means that `start_year` is adjusted in each iteration based on the current value of `nums[x]`.

3. **Final Value of `start_year`**:
   - After all iterations, `start_year` will be the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` in the range of `len(nums)`.
   - Since `x` takes on the value of the last index of `nums` after all iterations, the final value of `start_year` will be determined by the last adjustment made to it.

Given this, the final value of `start_year` will be the result of the formula applied to the last element of `nums`.

Output: **(start_year // nums[-1] + 1) * nums[-1]**
