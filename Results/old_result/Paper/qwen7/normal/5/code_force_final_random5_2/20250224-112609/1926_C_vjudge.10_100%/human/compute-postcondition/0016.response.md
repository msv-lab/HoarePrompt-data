Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in str(i):`. The variables involved here are `x` and `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `x`**: The variable `x` is an element from the string representation of `i`. When the loop starts, `x` will be the first character of the string representation of `i`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The initial state of `i` is given as a positive integer where `i + 1` is also a positive integer. This means `i` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `x` is derived from the string representation of `i`, we need to ensure that `i` is a positive integer such that its string representation allows the loop to start.
   - The initial value of `x` will be the first digit of `i` when the loop starts.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be a positive integer.
- `x` should be the first digit of `i` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state after adjustment would be:

State: **`i` is a positive integer, `x` is the first digit of `i`**
