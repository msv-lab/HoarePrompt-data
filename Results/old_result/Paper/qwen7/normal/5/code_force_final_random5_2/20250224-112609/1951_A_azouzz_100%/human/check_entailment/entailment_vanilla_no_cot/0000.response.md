Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program `generate_files_for_html_in_range` does not call itself within its defined scope, which is expected based on the problem description. However, the additional function `func_1` and its usage in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block are unrelated to the original problem and do not affect the correctness of the file generation logic. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not contain any code related to the original problem statement, which is to generate `.py` files from `.html` files in specified directories. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect for the given problem.
