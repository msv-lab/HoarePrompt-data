Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` must be greater than or equal to 0, `l` and `r` are assigned the values from input split by space.**

Explanation: The code calculates `onesInRange` as the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]`. The values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state, as they are not directly involved in the calculation.
