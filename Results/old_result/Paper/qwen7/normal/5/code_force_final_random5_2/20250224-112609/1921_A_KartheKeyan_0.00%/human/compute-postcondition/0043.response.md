Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is the last input integer from the third iteration, `y` is the last input integer from the third iteration, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the fourth and third tuple in `coord`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `n` must be at least 1**

Explanation: The code `coord = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `coord`. This clears the previous content of `coord`, making it an empty list. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `y`, `p2`, `res`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
