Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, and `k` is the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`. Since the if condition `b <= a` is not met in the else part, `k` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
