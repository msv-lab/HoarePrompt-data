Output State: **t is an input integer, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9), m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
