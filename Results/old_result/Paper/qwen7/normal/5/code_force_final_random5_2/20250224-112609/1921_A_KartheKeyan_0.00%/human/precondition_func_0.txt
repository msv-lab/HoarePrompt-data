The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. It is guaranteed that these points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
