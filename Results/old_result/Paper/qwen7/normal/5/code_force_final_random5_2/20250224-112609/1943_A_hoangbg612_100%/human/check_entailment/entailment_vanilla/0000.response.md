Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is unnecessary for solving the problem since the order of elements doesn't affect the MEX calculation directly. Sorting can be removed without affecting the logic.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `cur` is initialized to `-1`. This variable will keep track of the last number seen in the sequence.
   - `M` is a dictionary used to count occurrences of numbers in the array.

4. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through each number in the sorted array.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
   - If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Calculating MEX:**
   - After processing the array, the program checks if the sum of counts in `M` equals the size of the array `S`.
   - If they are equal, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` where the value is 1.
   - If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second key in `cnt`.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`, which should be the MEX of the array `c`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Logic for MEX Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating MEX is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the game's turns and the resulting array `c`.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the sorted array can be directly mapped to the sequence of moves made by Alice and Bob.

2. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program does not simulate the actual game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`.
   - The program does not account for the fact that Alice always picks an element from `a` and appends it to `c`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`.

3. **Output MEX:**
   - The program attempts to calculate MEX based on the counts of numbers in the array, which is not the correct approach for the given problem.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the game rules and does not compute the MEX of the array `c` as required by the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
