Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5. Each of the next m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that all pairs of friends are distinct, and the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
    s = 0
    a = 0
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
        a += f
    for i in range(k):
        s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
    print(s % M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `m`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `m * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * k + c * a` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=k-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `k-1` (since the loop runs from `i=0` to `i=k-1`), `k` must still be greater than 0, and `s` will be the cumulative sum of the expression `c * i * c * k + c * a` for every value of `i` from `0` to `k-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `k - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is `m`, `a` is the sum of all integers `f` obtained from the input split operation over all iterations, `u` is an integer from the input, `v` is an integer from the input, `f` is an integer from the input, `s` is `k * c * i * c * m + k * c * a`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
