Based on the initial state provided:

- `greater_count` is the total count of elements in list `a` that are less than `favorite_value`.
- `greater_count + same_value_count` is greater than `k`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('MAYBE')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'MAYBE'` regardless of the values of `greater_count`, `same_value_count`, and `k`.

Output: **MAYBE**
