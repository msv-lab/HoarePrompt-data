Output State: **`success` is True, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `positions` is a list of integers, `healths` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `n` is the first integer input after `t`, `k` is the second integer input after `t`.**

Explanation: The line `success = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `success`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
