Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it either breaks due to the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` being met or reaches `n`. After the loop has executed 3 times, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and the loop breaks because the condition was not met again (since `i` is already 2 and the loop does not continue beyond `n-1`). Therefore, the final values of `i` and `j` remain as they were after the third iteration, and `l` remains unchanged as no modifications were made to it within the loop.
