Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is either 0 or 0.5, `max` is 99999899, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing 99999999 if `x` is 0.5, otherwise it contains -99999999, `t` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was presumably 0 before this line of code). Since no other variables are affected, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is now 1, while all other variables retain their initial or previously calculated values.
