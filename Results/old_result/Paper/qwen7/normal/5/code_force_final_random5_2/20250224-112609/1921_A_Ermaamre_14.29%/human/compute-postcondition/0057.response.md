Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is the first integer from the input, `y1` is the second integer from the input, `x2` is the second integer from the input, `y2` is the second integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y3` is the second integer from the input split by space, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.**

Explanation: The code `res = abs(y1 - y2)` calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `res`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables and the updated value of `res`.
