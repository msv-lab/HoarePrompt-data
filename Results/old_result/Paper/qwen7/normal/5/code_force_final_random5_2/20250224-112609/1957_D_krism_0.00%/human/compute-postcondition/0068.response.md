Output State: `i` is 30, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `j` is 32, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31:
- If the bit at position `j` in `cur` (which is `prefix[30]`) is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is the count of occurrences where the bit was 1, which is 3.
- If the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is the count of occurrences where the bit was 0, which is also 3.

This means that after all 32 iterations of the loop, the variable `j` will have reached 32, as it increments with each iteration but does not change within the loop body. The matrix `suf` will reflect the counts of 1s and 0s for each bit position in `cur` (`prefix[30]`), with each bit being checked once during the loop, resulting in 3 occurrences of 1s and 3 occurrences of 0s for each bit position across all iterations.
