Reasoning:
The annotated program aims to find the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the number of signs (`n`).
   - It reads the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which is the base year from which we start checking for the next sign.
   - For each sign, it updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula ensures that `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints `start_year`, which should be the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

The logic in the program is correct because:
- The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` after the current `start_year`.
- This process is repeated for each sign, ensuring that the year calculated is the earliest possible year where all signs can occur sequentially.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
