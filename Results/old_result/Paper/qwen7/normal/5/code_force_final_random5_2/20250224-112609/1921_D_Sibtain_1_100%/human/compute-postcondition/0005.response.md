Based on the initial state provided:

- `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space.
- `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The set of `a` contains only one unique element.
- `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The set of `c` contains only one unique element, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`.

The print statement simply outputs `0`.

Output: **0**
