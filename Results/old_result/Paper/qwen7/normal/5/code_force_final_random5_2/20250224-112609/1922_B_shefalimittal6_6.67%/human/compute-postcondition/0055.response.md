Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`. This means the loop will iterate over the values of the `num_of_lens` dictionary.

2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value. If `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, there will be no values to iterate over, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `cnt` will take on the values from `num_of_lens.values()`, but since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to specify the exact value of `cnt`.

4. **State the final modified state**:
   - We need to ensure that `num_of_lens` is not an empty dictionary for the loop to execute.
   - The state of `res` (which is 0) does not affect the loop's execution, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`num_of_lens` must not be an empty dictionary**.
