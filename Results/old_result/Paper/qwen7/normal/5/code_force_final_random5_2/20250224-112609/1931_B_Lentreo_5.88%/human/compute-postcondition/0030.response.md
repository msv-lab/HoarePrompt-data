Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `curr` is the sum of \((i - last)\) for each non-zero `i` in `nums`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\), `last` is now the last element of the updated `nums` list, and `nums` is updated with integers from the input split into a list.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `last` to be the last element of the `nums` list. All other variables (`n`, `curr`, `t`, and the `nums` list itself) remain unchanged from their initial states.
