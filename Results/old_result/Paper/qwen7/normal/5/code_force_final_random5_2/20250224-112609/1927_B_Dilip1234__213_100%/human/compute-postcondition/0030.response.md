Postcondition: **`char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 1`, `char_count` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `s` is a string containing the character corresponding to the index `j` in the alphabet. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
