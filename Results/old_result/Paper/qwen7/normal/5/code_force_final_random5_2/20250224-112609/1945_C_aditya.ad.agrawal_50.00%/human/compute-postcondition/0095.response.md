Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 1, `o_r` is 0, `z_r` is 1, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - (ans + 1))`, and the condition `(o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - (ans + 1))))` is true.**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1. Initially, `pos` was assigned to `ans`. Therefore, after the increment, `pos` becomes `ans + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition involving `o_r`, `z_r`, `b_d`, and the positions `n/2` and `pos` remains the same as the initial condition, just with `pos` updated to `ans + 1`.
