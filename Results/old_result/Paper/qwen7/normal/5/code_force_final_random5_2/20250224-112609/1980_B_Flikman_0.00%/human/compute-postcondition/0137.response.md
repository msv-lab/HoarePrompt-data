Postcondition: **`greater_count` is less than `k`, `same_value_count` is between 0 and the length of list `a`, inclusive, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `f` is the integer value of the second input, `k` is the integer value of the third input, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in list `a`, and the sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`**.
