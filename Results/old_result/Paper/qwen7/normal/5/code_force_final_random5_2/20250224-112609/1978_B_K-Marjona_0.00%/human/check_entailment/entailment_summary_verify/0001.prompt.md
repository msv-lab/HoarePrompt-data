You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: the number of buns (n), the usual price of a bun (a), and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). It calculates the total cost of buying n buns under the given pricing conditions and prints the result for each test case. If the modified price (b) is less than or equal to the usual price (a), it calculates the total cost based on the usual price. Otherwise, it calculates the total cost considering both the usual and modified prices for the respective buns.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling \( n \) buns.
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price which decreases linearly from \( b \) to \( b - k + 1 \).
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It calculates \( k \) as the minimum of \( n \) and \( b - a \). This ensures \( k \) is non-negative and does not exceed the number of buns or the difference between the initial and usual prices.
   - If \( b \leq a \), it means the usual price is higher or equal to the modified price, so no promotion is beneficial, and all buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula:
     - The sum of an arithmetic series for the first \( k \) buns: \(\frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1))\).
     - The remaining buns sold at the usual price \( a \): \((n - k) \times a\).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating \( k \) is correct.
   - The condition `if b <= a` correctly identifies when no promotion is beneficial.
   - The arithmetic series sum formula is applied correctly to calculate the profit for the first \( k \) buns.
   - The remaining buns are correctly calculated and added to the total profit.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \( b \leq a \), the solution correctly prints \( n \times a \).
   - When \( b > a \), the solution correctly uses the arithmetic series sum formula and the usual price for the remaining buns.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the profit based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
