Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is the input integer, `s` is increased by `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

This means that the value of `n` has been updated to `n // 2`, while all other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) retain their original conditions or values as described in the initial state.
