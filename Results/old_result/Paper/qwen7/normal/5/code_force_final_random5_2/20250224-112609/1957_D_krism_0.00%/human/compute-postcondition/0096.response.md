Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially -1.
   - `n` is initially 31.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1)` will execute as long as `i` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
   - Given that `n` is 31, the loop will start with `i` being 1 and increment `i` until `i` reaches 31.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently -1, the loop cannot start because `-1` is not within the range `[1, 31]`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is set to 1, which is the starting value of the loop.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` should be set to 1.
   - `n` remains 31.

The other variables (`cur`, `j`, `suf`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given loop condition.

Therefore, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 31**
