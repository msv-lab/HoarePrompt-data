Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by positive integers \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \), along with arrays \( p \) and \( a \). For each test case, it determines whether "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the values in array \( a \) at positions \( P_B - 1 \) and \( P_S - 1 \), and their permutations. It calculates scores for "Bodya" and "Sasha" using permutations and comparisons, and outputs the result of the comparison between these scores.**
