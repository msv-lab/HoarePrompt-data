Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1, and the result of `(c >> j) & 1` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. The initial state of `(c >> j) & 1` being 0 is preserved because the code does not affect `c` or `j`.
