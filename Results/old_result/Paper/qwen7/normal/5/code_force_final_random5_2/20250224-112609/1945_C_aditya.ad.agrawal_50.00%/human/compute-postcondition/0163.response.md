Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i`, which is taken from the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `arr`.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head variables**:
   - Since `i` is taken from `arr`, the length of `arr` will decrease by one in each iteration.
   - The variable `i` will take the next element from `arr` in the next iteration.

4. **Other variables**:
   - `pos`: The problem statement mentions that `pos` is either equal to its original value plus 2 or increased by 1. This means `pos` could change in each iteration but it doesn't depend on the loop itself.
   - `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, and `ans`: These variables are not directly controlled by the loop head but might change within the loop body. However, since we are only adjusting the states based on the loop head, these variables remain unchanged for the next iteration unless explicitly modified in the loop body.

5. **Postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - `arr` will have at least one less element than before.
   - `i` will be the next element in `arr`.
   - `pos`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, and `ans` will retain their values from the previous iteration unless modified within the loop body.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` retains its value from the previous iteration, `z_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_l` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `ans` retains its value from the previous iteration.**
