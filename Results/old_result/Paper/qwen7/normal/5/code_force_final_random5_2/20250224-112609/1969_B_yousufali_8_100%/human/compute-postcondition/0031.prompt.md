You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) and its length is at least 2.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is an input binary string, `n` is equal to the total number of '1's in `s`, `ans` is the sum of each block of '0's plus one, and `i` is the index right after the last character of `s`.
    #
    #To explain this in more detail:
    #- The variable `n` keeps track of the number of '1's encountered so far.
    #- The variable `ans` accumulates the count of each block of '0's plus one. This means if there are two consecutive '0's, it contributes 3 to `ans` (2 '0's plus 1).
    #- The variable `i` is the index of the current character being processed in the string `s`.
    #- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, indicating that all characters have been processed.
    #- `n` will be the total count of '1's in the string `s`.
    #- `ans` will be the sum of the lengths of all blocks of '0's plus one for each block.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the lengths of all blocks of '0's plus one for each block in the binary string s)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the binary string `s` contains at least two consecutive '1's.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
