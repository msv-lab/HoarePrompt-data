Output State: `t` must be exactly equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is now `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of integers input by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split. Depending on the conditions met in the loop, the output printed during each iteration will be either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. After all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` sets of inputs, and the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will reflect the most recent input provided by the user.
