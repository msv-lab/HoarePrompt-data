Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is an empty string, `j` is 105.**

The code `s = ''` assigns an empty string to `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
