Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `a1` is inserted at position `idx2` in list `l1`, `l` is assigned the value of `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` simply assigns the value of `l1` to the variable `l`. This does not change the values of any other variables or conditions specified in the initial state.
