`cur` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur` was originally equal to the last element in the original list `N`. The states of the other variables (`M` and `S`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is equal to the last element in the original list `N` plus 1; `M` contains each unique element from `N` as a key with its corresponding count as the value; the sum of all counts in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`.

Output State: **`cur` is equal to the last element in the original list `N` plus 1; `M` contains each unique element from `N` as a key with its corresponding count as the value; the sum of all counts in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`.**
