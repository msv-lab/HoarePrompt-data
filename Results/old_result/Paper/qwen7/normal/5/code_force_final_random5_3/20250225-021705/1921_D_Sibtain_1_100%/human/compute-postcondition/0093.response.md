Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a` plus the max value for the current iteration (which is the fourth iteration), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping integers from input, `c` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `c = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `c`. The values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
