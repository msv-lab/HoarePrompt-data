Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `x` which iterates over `num_list`.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the first element of `num_list`) is present with its value incremented by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`. If `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added as a new key with a value of 1.
   - `test_cases` remains a list of tuples.
   - `results` remains an empty list.
   - `num_list` remains a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `_` must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first element of `num_list`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `num_list`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the first element of `num_list`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must still contain at least one element.
   - After the first iteration, `x` will be the second element of `num_list` (if it exists).

5. **Update the states**:
   - `num_of_lens` will remain unchanged unless `x` is the first element of `num_list` and needs to be processed.
   - `test_cases` will remain unchanged.
   - `results` will remain unchanged.
   - `num_list` will be updated to remove the first element (which is `x`).
   - `x` will be the second element of `num_list`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the first element of `num_list`) is present with its value incremented by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`. If `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added as a new key with a value of 1. `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with the first element removed, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the second element of `num_list`.**
