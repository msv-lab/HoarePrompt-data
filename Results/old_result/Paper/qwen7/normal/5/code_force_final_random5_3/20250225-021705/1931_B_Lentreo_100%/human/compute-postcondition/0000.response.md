Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, which is an integer, and the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(nums)` assigns the length of the list `nums` to the variable `n`. The precondition that the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n` remains unchanged.
