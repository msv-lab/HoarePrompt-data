Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly n characters, where 1 <= n <= 20, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing at least one digit from `password` and the appended character `char`; `letters` is an empty list.**

The code `digits.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the list `digits`. Since `char` is part of the password and is a digit (as per the initial state), `digits` now contains at least one digit from the password plus the newly appended character. The variable `letters` remains unchanged as it is still an empty list.
