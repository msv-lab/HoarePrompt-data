Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for iterable2 in range(innerLoop)`. The variables involved here are `iterable2` and `innerLoop`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `iterable2` is initialized to 0 because `range(innerLoop)` starts from 0.
   - `innerLoop` is given as `prev_iterable`, which is equal to `innerLoop`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `iterable2` is less than `innerLoop`. Therefore, `innerLoop` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `iterable2` should be set to 0 (the starting value of the range).
   - `innerLoop` should be set to a value greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `iterable2` and `innerLoop`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list**
