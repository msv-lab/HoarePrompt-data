Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list containing 4 lists, each list contains integers inputted by the user.
- `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`.
- `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(dx * dx)` is executed.

1. Since `a` is a list of 4 lists, let's denote these lists as `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`.
2. Each of these lists contains integers inputted by the user. Let's denote the first element of `a[0]` as `a[0][0]`, the first element of `a[1]` as `a[1][0]`, and so on.
3. The list `x` is constructed by taking the first element from each of these lists, so `x = [a[0][0], a[1][0], a[2][0], a[3][0]]`.
4. `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

Since we don't have the specific values of the integers inputted by the user, we cannot provide a numerical value for `dx`. However, we know that `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

Therefore, the expression `dx * dx` will be the square of this difference.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list [a[0][0], a[1][0], a[2][0], a[3][0]])**
