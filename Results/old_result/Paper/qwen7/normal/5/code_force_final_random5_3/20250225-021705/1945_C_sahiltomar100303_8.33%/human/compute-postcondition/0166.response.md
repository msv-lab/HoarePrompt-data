Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `right` is no longer `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0**.

The code simply initializes `tleftOne` to 0, which does not affect any other variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial states except for `tleftOne`, which is now explicitly set to 0.
