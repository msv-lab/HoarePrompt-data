Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` must be at least 5.
   - `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, or `-1`.
   - `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, or `i+1`.
   - `p1` is either 1 or 0.
   - `p2` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in `range(n - 1)`.

3. **What Changes with Each Iteration:**
   - The variable `i` increments by 1 at the end of each iteration.

4. **Determine the New State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`).
   - After the loop increments `i`, the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will now be `i_prev + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modifications are mentioned, they stay as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Postconditions:**
   - The postconditions involving `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n` remain the same unless the loop body changes them.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.

Since the exact initial values of `i` and `n` are not specified, we can generalize the answer based on the structure of the problem.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`** (where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
