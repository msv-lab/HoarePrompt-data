Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing 4 lists, each list contains integers inputted by the user, `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`, `dx` is undefined**

Explanation: The code `x = [p[0] for p in a]` creates a new list `x` where each element is the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `dx` remain unchanged.
