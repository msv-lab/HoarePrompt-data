Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No' if there is at least one pair of elements where the first is greater than the second.
- This function does not account for the possibility of sorting the array through the specified operation (splitting and swapping parts of the array).
- For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. The array is not sorted, but it can be sorted by splitting it into `[1, 1, 4, 5]` and `[1, 4]`, and then swapping these parts to get `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4] -> [1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5] -> [1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`, which is sorted.
- The function `func_2` reads the input correctly but uses `func_1` which does not handle the problem as described. Therefore, the overall solution is incorrect because it does not implement the logic to check if the array can be sorted using the specified operation.
