Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers converted from space-separated integers input by the user, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `i = 0` sets the value of `i` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
