Output State: **`list[i + 1]` is decreased by the value of `2 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i - 1]` is now `0`.**

Explanation: The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` subtracts `list[i - 1]` from itself, which means it sets `list[i - 1]` to 0. The precondition that `list[i - 1]` remains a positive number is no longer valid since it is now 0. The value of `list[i + 1]` is unchanged from its original state, which is decreased by `2 * list[i - 1]`. Since `list[i - 1]` is now 0, the decrease to `list[i + 1]` is effectively 0.
