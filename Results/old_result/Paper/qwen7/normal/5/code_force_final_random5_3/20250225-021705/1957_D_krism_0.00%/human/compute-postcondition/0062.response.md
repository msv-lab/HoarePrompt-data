Output State: **`i` is 31; `j` is 2; `suf[j][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, `suf[2][0]` is incremented by 1. Since `suf` is not initialized in the initial state, we assume it is a list or a nested list where `suf[2]` exists and initially `suf[2][0]` is 0. After the operation, `suf[2][0]` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
