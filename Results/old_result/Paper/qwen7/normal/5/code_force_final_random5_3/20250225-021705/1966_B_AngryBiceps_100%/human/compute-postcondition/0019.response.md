Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is an input from the user.
- `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each element in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each element in the list `a`.
- The set of the first element in `a` contains only one unique character.
- The set of the last element in `a` contains only one unique character.
- The first and last elements in `a` are not the same.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
