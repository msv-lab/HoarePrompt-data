Output State: **`last_digit_index` is 0, password is a string, i is 0, char is the first digit in the password**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `last_digit_index`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `last_digit_index` is updated to 0, while `password`, `i`, and `char` retain their original values.
