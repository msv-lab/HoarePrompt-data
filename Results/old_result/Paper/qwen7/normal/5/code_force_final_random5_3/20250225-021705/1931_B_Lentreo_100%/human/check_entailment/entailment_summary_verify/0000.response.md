### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary to validate the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if we can make the amount of water in all containers the same using the allowed operations (pouring water from one container to another where the source index is less than the target index).
- The sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers \( n \), ensuring that each container can potentially end up with the same amount of water, which is \( \frac{\text{total}}{n} \).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` calculates the mean value based on the sum of the elements in `nums`.
- It then checks if the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean remains non-negative throughout the iteration.
- If the cumulative sum ever becomes negative, the function returns 'NO'.
- Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by \( n \). This is a crucial step because if the sum is not divisible by \( n \), it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

2. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have, which is \( \text{mean} = \frac{\text{total}}{n} \).

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program iterates through each container and checks if the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the mean remains non-negative.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water, and the program returns 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
- The sum divisibility check ensures that the problem constraints are met.
- The balance check ensures that the cumulative differences do not become negative, which would indicate an imbalance that cannot be corrected with the allowed operations.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.
