Output State: **`cur` is now `num`, `i` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces (now including its last element), `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value either `1` or `2`, and `num` is the last element of `N`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is updated to be equal to `num`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
