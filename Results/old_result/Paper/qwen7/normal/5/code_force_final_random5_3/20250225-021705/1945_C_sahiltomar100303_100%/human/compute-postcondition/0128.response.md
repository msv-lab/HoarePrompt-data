Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0.
- `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value depending on the value of `s[right]`.
- `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1 depending on the value of `s[right]`.
- `tleftZero` is 3 if `s[right]` is '0' and 2 if `s[right]` is '1'.
- `trightZero` is 0 less than its previous value.
- `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0'.
- `right` is equal to `n`.
- `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(right + 1) // 2`.
- `left` is equal to 0.
- `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

The `print(left)` statement will print the value of the variable `left`.

Given that `left` is explicitly set to 0 in the initial state, the output will be:

Output: **0**
