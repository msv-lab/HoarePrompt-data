Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value depending on the value of `s[right]`, `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or one less than its previous value, `tleftZero` is 0, and `trightZero` is either the same as its previous value or 1 less than its previous value. If `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` remains 0 and `trightZero` is 1 less than its previous value. If `s[right]` is not '0', `students` is 1 less than its initial value and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.
