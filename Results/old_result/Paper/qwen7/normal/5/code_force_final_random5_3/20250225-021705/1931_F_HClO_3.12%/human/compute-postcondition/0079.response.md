Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` and `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`; `n` is greater than 1; `idx2` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code `idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. All other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
