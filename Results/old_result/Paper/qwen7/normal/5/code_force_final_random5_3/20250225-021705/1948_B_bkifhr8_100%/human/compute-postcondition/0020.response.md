Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`, and `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` shifted by one and the current element of `arr`. If `nums` is not sorted, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
