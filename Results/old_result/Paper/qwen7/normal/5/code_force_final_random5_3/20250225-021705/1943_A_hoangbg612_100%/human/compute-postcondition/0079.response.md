Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list, `num` is an element of the list `N`, and `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`; `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The values of `N`, `num`, and the condition about `num` being less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N` remain unchanged.
