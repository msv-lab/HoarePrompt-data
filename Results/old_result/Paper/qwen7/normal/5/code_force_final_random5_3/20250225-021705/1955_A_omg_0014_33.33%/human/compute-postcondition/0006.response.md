Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`.
- The current value of `a * b` is less than the current value of `a * d`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a * b)`.

From the information given, we know that `a * b` is less than `a * d`, where `d = c / 2`. This means that `a * b < a * (c / 2)`. However, the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not explicitly provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a * b`. We only know that it is a product of two integers `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `a * b`, which is an integer product of `a` and `b`.

Output: **a * b (where a and b are integers obtained from the input split)**
