Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not used in the main logic of the program. Instead, the program directly checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency dictionary returned by `func_1`, which is unnecessary and does not solve the problem as intended.

The correct approach should involve using the frequency dictionary to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the operations. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_cards = n
    for freq in frequency_table.values():
        min_cards = min(min_cards, (freq + k - 1) // k * (k - 1))
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected program properly calculates the minimum number of cards that can remain by considering the frequency of each number and applying the operation optimally.
