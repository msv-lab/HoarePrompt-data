To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2):
```

The loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
1. `left > 0`
2. Either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is greater than `mid`
- `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`
- `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`
- `left` is `mid - 1`
- `leftMove` is `0`
- `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` (if `s[left - 1] == '0'`)
- `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` (if `s[left - 1] != '0'`)

We need to ensure that the loop can continue based on the loop condition. Let's break it down:

### Condition 1: `left > 0`
- The current value of `left` is `mid - 1`.
- For the loop to continue, `left` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `mid - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `mid` must be greater than 1.

### Condition 2: `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`
- We need to check both parts of this condition:
  - `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2`: This condition depends on the value of `leftZero` and `left`. Since `left` is `mid - 1`, we need to ensure that `leftZero` is less than `(mid - 1 + 1) // 2 = mid // 2`.
  - `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`: This condition depends on the value of `rightOne` and `n - left`. Since `left` is `mid - 1`, we need to ensure that `rightOne` is less than `(n - (mid - 1) + 1) // 2 = (n - mid + 2) // 2`.

### Summary of Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `mid` is greater than 1.
- Ensure `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2`.
- Ensure `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`.

Since these adjustments are necessary for the loop to continue, the final state should reflect these changes.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid` and `mid` must be greater than 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` (if `s[left - 1] == '0'`), and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` (if `s[left - 1] != '0'`, and `leftZero` must be less than `mid // 2`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`)**
