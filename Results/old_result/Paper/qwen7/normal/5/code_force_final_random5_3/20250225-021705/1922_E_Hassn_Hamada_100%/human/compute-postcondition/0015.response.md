Output State: **`size_overlap` is (2, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 1, `size` is `i + 3`, `value` is \(2^{i+3} - 2^i\), and `value` is \(2^{i+3} - 2^i\).**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `value` to \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\). Given the initial state, `size` is \(i + 3\), so the new value of `value` is calculated as follows:

- `size` is \(i + 3\)
- `value` is updated to \((1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)\)

This simplifies to \(2^{i+3} - 2^i\). The other variables remain unchanged.
