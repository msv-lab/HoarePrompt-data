Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where 't' is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and 'X' is an integer between 2 and 10^18. Based on these values, the function returns a specific output.**

This means the function, although defined without explicit parameters, works within a context where it receives two values: `t` (a positive integer between 1 and 1000) and `X` (an integer between 2 and 10^18). The function then processes these values to produce a result, though the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information.
