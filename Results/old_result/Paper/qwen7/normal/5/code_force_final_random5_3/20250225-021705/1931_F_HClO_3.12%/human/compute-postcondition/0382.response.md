Postcondition: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
