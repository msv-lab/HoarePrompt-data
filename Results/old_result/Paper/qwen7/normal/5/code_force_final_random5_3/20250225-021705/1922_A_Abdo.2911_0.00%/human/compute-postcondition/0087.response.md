Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Since `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is now 1, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than 1.

4. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Consider the postcondition for `match_c`**:
   - The postcondition for `match_c` is based on the comparison between `c[i]` and `template[i]` after converting them to lowercase.
   - This postcondition does not change the loop's continuation logic but affects the loop body's behavior.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
