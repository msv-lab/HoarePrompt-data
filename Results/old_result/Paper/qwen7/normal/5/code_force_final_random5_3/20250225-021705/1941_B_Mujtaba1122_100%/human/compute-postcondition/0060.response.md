Based on the initial state described:

- The list is mostly zeros.
- The last element (`list[n-1]`) is -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value.
- The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the list or any other variables, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
