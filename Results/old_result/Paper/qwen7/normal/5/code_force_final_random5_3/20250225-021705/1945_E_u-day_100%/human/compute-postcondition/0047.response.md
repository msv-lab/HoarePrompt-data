Based on the initial state provided:

- `pos` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is equal to `n-1`
- `low` is such that `arr[low]` equals `k`
- `high` is such that `low + 1 < high`
- `mid` is added to set `st` multiple times
- `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` in each iteration until the final search range cannot be further narrowed

The `print(0)` statement will simply print the integer 0.

Output: **0**
