### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program first checks if the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`. This is a necessary condition for making the amount of water in all containers the same. If the sum is not divisible by `n`, it is impossible to achieve the desired outcome, and the program correctly returns 'NO'.

2. **Mean Calculation**:
   - If the sum is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have (`mean = total // n`). This value represents the target amount of water each container needs to have for all containers to have the same amount of water.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program then iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current container's water and the mean is balanced out across all containers. Specifically, it keeps track of the cumulative difference (`curr`) between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water, and the program returns 'NO'.
   - If the cumulative difference remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it implies that the water can be redistributed such that all containers end up with the mean amount of water, and the program returns 'YES'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description. The annotations also support this understanding, confirming that the program correctly evaluates the balance of water across containers.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
