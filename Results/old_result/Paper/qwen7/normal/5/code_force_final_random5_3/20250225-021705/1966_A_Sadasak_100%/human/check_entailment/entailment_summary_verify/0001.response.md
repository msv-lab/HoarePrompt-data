### Reasoning

The original assessment provided an incorrect analysis of the given program. Let's break down the issues and provide the correct solution.

#### Issues in the Original Assessment

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` sets the frequency of any card number to `k` if it exceeds `k`, which is unnecessary and does not help in solving the problem.
   - The logic should simply count the occurrences of each card number without setting any upper limit.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies:**
   - After calling `func_1`, the program checks if `k` is present in the frequency values. This is incorrect because the presence of `k` does not guarantee that `k - 1` cards can be achieved.
   - The program should sum the remaining cards from all groups to get the minimum number of cards.

3. **Missing Grouping and Calculation:**
   - The original program does not group the cards by their numbers and calculate the remaining cards correctly.

#### Correct Approach

1. **Group the Cards by Their Numbers:**
   - Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each card number.

2. **Calculate Remaining Cards:**
   - For each group, calculate how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed and how many cards will remain.
   - Sum up the remaining cards from all groups to get the minimum number of cards.

#### Corrected Program

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Group the cards by their numbers
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] += 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        # Calculate how many full groups of k cards can be formed
        full_groups = count // k
        # Add the remaining cards after forming full groups
        min_cards += count % k
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Final Evaluation

The corrected program accurately implements the logic to find the minimum number of cards by grouping the cards and calculating the remaining cards. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

**Final: True**

The given program is now correct.
