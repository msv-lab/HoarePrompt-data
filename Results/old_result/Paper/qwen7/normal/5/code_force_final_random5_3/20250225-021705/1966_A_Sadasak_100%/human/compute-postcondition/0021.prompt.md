You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, and k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` is a list of integers, and for every unique number `num` in `arr`, `frequency_table[num]` will be the minimum value between the count of `num` in `arr` and `k`. If a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`. All other keys in `frequency_table` will not exist if they were not present in `arr`.
    #
    #This means that for each number in the original list `arr`, the final value in the `frequency_table` will reflect the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k` times, ensuring no number's count exceeds `k` in the `frequency_table`.
    return frequency_table
    #A dictionary named `frequency_table` where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and the value for each key is the minimum value between the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`. All other keys in `frequency_table` will not exist if they were not present in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique number from `arr` and the value for each key is the minimum value between the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`. All other keys in `frequency_table` will not exist if they were not present in `arr`.

```

Return Postconditions: A dictionary named `frequency_table` where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and the value for each key is the minimum value between the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`. All other keys in `frequency_table` will not exist if they were not present in `arr`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
