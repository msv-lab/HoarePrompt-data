Output State: **`p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]`, `p[i+1]` is equal to `mex - a[i+1]`, `p[i+2]` is equal to `mex - a[i+2]`, `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `p[i]` to be `mex - a[i]`. This changes the value of `p[i]` but does not affect the values of `p[i+1]` and `p[i+2]`. Additionally, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Therefore, `mex` now is the minimum of its original value and the new value of `p[i]`.
