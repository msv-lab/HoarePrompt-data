Output State: **`T` must be at least 1; `index` is increased by `n`; `a` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and of length `n`; `last_year` is the first element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the first element of the list `a` to the variable `last_year`. The other variables (`T`, `index`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
