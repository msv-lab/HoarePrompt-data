Output State: `results` is an empty list, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `j` is equal to `n`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `reachable_first_row` will be set to False because the condition to keep it as True (i.e., encountering '>' in `row1`) is not met after all iterations. `reachable_second_row` remains True because it is set to True when '>' is encountered in `row2` and is not reset within the loop. The variable `j` reaches `n` after all iterations of the loop have completed.
