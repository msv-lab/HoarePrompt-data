The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer t (indicating the number of subsequent test instances), followed by t sets of data. Each set consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. For each set, the function sorts the list of integers in non-decreasing order, calculates the sum of the differences between the last half and the first half of the sorted list, and prints this sum for each set.
