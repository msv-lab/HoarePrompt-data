Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n-5`, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, and either `rightZero` is 1 or `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is decremented by 1. The initial state of `i` is `n-4`, so after decrementing `left` by 1, `i` becomes `n-5`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
