### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate this sequence based on the input number `number`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function aims to construct a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences is determined by the input `number`.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to build the sequence.
   - The main logic involves setting up a sequence of numbers and adjusting values based on the binary representation of `number`.

3. **Binary Representation Approach**:
   - The function iteratively builds the sequence using powers of 2.
   - For a given `size`, it appends numbers from `0` to `size-1` to the sequence.
   - It then recursively adjusts these values based on the binary representation of `number`.

4. **Base Case and Recursive Case**:
   - When `number` is `0`, it returns `0` indicating the sequence is complete.
   - For non-zero `number`, it calculates the appropriate size and constructs the sequence accordingly.
   - It ensures that the sequence meets the requirement by adjusting values based on the binary representation.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The main loop prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - The sequence construction seems to correctly handle the binary representation and ensure the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the base case (`number == 0`) correctly.
   - It uses assertions to ensure the sequence is built correctly during recursion.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to generate the required sequence based on the input `X`.

### Correctness:
**True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the logic implemented in the `func_1` function.
