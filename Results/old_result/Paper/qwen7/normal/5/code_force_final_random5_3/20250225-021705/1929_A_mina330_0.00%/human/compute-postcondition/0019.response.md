Output State: **`ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is `ntest`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input and sorted in non-decreasing order, `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the resulting list in `a`. The original values of `ntest`, `itest`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to reflect the new input, and `kq` remains as the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` in the specified range, which was calculated before this line of code.
