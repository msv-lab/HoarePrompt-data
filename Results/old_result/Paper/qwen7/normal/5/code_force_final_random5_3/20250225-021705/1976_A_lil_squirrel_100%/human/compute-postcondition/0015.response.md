Postcondition: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing characters from the password that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing characters from the password that are digits. If the character `ch` is a digit, `digits` now includes the character `ch`; otherwise, `ch` is appended to the `letters` list.
