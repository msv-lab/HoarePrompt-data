Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `cnt`, which is iterating over the values of `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are values in `num_of_lens.values()`. This means the loop will run for each unique element in `num_of_lens`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `cnt`**: Since `cnt` is iterating over the values of `num_of_lens`, it will take on the values of the counts stored in `num_of_lens`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `cnt` should be set to the first value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

4. **Check the Initial State of `num_of_lens`**: For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value. If `num_of_lens` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given these points, let's adjust the initial state accordingly:

- `total_count` is 0 (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value for the loop to execute.
- `test_cases` and `results` remain unchanged (they do not affect the loop execution).
- `num_list` is an empty list (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer, and `_` must be greater than 0 (these do not affect the loop execution).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value, and `cnt` will be set to the first value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

**State:**
**`num_of_lens` must contain at least one value, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens.values()`**
