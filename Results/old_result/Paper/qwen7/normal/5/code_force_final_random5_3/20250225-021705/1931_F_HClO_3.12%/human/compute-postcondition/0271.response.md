Output State: **`m` must be at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

The code splits the input into multiple parts using `map(int, input().split())`. The first part is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are unpacked into `l3`. The initial conditions for `m` and `val` remain unchanged.
