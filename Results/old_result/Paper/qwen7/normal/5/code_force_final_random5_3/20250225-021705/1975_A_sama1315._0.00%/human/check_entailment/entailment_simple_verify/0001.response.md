### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

Here is the code for `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'
```

**Analysis:**
- The function correctly checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order using `all()`.
- It returns 'Yes' if the array is sorted.
- It uses `any()` to check if there is at least one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element.
- If such a pair exists, it returns 'No', otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

However, the function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted. It does not verify if the array can be made sorted by splitting and swapping parts. This is a critical oversight in the original assessment.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function reads the input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Here is the code for `func_2`:
```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

**Analysis:**
- The function reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
- It iterates over each test case, extracting the necessary information (number of elements `n` and the array elements).
- It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
- Finally, it prints the results, each on a new line.

The function `func_2` correctly processes the input and calls `func_1`, but it does not handle the problem as described. It only checks if the array is already sorted, not if it can be made sorted by splitting and swapping parts.

### Conclusion
The original assessment incorrectly assumed that `func_1` correctly determines if the array can be made sorted by splitting and swapping parts. However, `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for solving the problem.

Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

**Final: False**
