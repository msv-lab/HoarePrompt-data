Postcondition: `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is different from 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, `start` plus 1 is less than the length of `lst`; if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`. The current value of `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
