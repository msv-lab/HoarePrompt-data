Based on the initial state provided:

- `pos` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- `low` and `high` are such that `low + 1 < high`.
- `mid` is added to set `st` multiple times and is updated to `(low + high) // 2` in each iteration until the final search range cannot be further narrowed.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

We need to determine the values of `low + 1` and `pos + 1` when the `print` statement executes.

From the information given:
- `pos` is explicitly stated to be 2.
- `low + 1 < high` implies that `low` is less than `high - 1`.

The key point here is that the loop continues until the search range cannot be further narrowed, meaning `low` and `high` will converge to the same value or `low + 1` will be equal to `high`. Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, the loop will continue to narrow down the search range.

Given that `i = n - 1` and `n > 0`, the loop will eventually terminate with `low` being the position where the binary search ends. Since `pos` is 2, and the loop narrows down the search range, `low` will be the position where the target is found or the closest valid position if the target is not found.

Since the loop converges and `low` is the final position, and `pos` is 2, it implies that `low` will be 1 (because `pos` is 2 and `low` is the position just before `pos` in the context of the search).

Therefore, `low + 1` will be 2, and `pos + 1` will be 3.

Output: **2 3**
