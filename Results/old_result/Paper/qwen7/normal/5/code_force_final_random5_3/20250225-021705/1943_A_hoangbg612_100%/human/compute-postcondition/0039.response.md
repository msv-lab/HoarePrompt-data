Output State: The final value of `cur` will be the largest number in the list `N`, and the dictionary `M` will map each unique number in `N` to its frequency count. Specifically, `M[cur]` will be the count of occurrences of `cur` in `N`, and `M[num]` for any `num < cur` will be the count of how many times `num` appears in `N` up to the point where `cur` was last incremented.

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `cur` will hold the maximum value present in the list `N`. The dictionary `M` will contain entries for each unique number in `N`, with the value being the count of how many times that number appears in the list.
