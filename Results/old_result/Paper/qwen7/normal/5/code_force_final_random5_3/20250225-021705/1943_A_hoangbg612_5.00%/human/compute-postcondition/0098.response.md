Output State: **`cur` is the next element in `N`, `N` must contain at least one element, and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Since `cur` is the next element in `N` and `N` contains at least one element, these conditions remain unchanged. The only difference is that `M[cur]` is now incremented by 1.
