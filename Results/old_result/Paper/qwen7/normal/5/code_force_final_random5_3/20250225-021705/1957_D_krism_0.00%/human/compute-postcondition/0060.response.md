Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 31
- `j` is 1
- The postcondition states that if `cur >> j & 1` is true, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is set to 1.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(32):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- `j` is the loop variable, which ranges from 0 to 31.

### Adjusting the State
- The only variable in the loop head that changes within the loop is `j`.
- The condition `cur >> j & 1` is evaluated based on the value of `j`, but the loop itself does not directly change `i` or any other variables outside the loop scope.

### Next Iteration
- At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

### Updated State
- `i` remains unchanged at 31.
- `j` is now 2.
- The postcondition will be evaluated again based on the new value of `j`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 31, `j` is 2**
