Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[ (x, y), (x, y) ]`, `i` is 4, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The other variables (`res`, `n`, `coord`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) are not affected by this operation.
