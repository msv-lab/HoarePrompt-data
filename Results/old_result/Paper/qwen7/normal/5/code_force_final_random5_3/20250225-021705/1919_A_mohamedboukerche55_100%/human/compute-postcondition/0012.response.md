Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, after the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to the number of iterations completed so far.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `t`, and `t` does not change within the loop.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is the number of iterations completed so far, so if the loop just finished its last iteration, `i` would be `t - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `t - 1` and then incremented to `t`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is \(t - 1\) and will be incremented to \(t\)**.
