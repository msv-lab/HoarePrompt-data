Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, and if the condition `len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0])` is true, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `c`) remain unchanged. The condition checking part of the initial state remains intact.
