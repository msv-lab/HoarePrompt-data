Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, the current value of `cur` is increased by 1 if the condition `num > cur + 1` is true, and remains unchanged otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. This does not affect the condition `num > cur + 1` which was previously checked. The condition itself is not evaluated within this line of code, so the postcondition about the condition remains as it was before the assignment. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cur` and retains the original postcondition.
