Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through each one using a loop.
2. **Card Counting Logic**:
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers.
   - It checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If true, it prints `n` because no operations can reduce the number of cards further.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the frequency table of card numbers, ensuring no number appears more than `k` times.
   - It then checks if `k` is present in the frequency table. If true, it prints `k - 1` as the result. Otherwise, it prints `n`.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly counts the occurrences of each card number and ensures no number appears more than `k` times.
   - It uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each card number, updating it to `k` if the count exceeds `k`.
   - The function returns the frequency table, which is used in the main logic to determine the minimum number of cards remaining.
4. **Output Handling**:
   - The program outputs the correct minimum number of cards for each test case based on the logic described.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
