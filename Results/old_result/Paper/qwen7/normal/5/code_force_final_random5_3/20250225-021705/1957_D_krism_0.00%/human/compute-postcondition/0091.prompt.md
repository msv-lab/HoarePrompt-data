Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `pre` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [32, 0]; `suf` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [0, 0]; `i` is 32; `n` is 32.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all 32 iterations, each sublist in `pre` will have its first element set to 32 (since `pre[i][0] += 1` was executed 32 times for each `i`), while the second element remains 0. The variable `suf` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to 32 (one past the last index processed in the loop), and `n` retains its initial value of 32.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    cur = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if cur >> j & 1:
            suf[j][1] += 1
        else:
            suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` remains 32, `j` is 31, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` in `i` (which is 32) is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is equal to the count of 1s at that bit position across all bits of `i`, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is equal to the count of 0s at that bit position.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 31, `j` is 31, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range.

To understand this final state, consider that the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 31. For each `j`, it checks the `j`-th bit of `cur` (from the right, starting at 0). If the bit is 1, it increments `suf[j][1]`. If the bit is 0, it increments `suf[j][0]`. By the end of the loop, `suf[j][1]` will hold the number of 1s in the bits from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` will hold the number of 0s in the same range. This means that `suf[0][1]` will be the total number of 1s in the last 32 bits of `cur`, and `suf[0][0]` will be the total number of 0s in those bits.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 30, `j` is 0, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the total count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total count of bits set to 0 in the same range.

After the loop completes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 0, as the loop decrements `j` from 31 to 0. The variable `cur` remains unchanged at the initial value of `prefix[30]`. For each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` will contain the total number of 1s in the binary representation of `cur` (since it counts 1s from position `j` to 31, and after 32 iterations, this covers all bits), and `suf[j][0]` will contain the total number of 0s in the same range.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
