Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case count `t` and for each test case, an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It returns a result based on the processed data.**

This means the function `func_1` does not accept any parameters through its definition but is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes an integer `n` representing the number of integers in a list `a`, where each element in the list `a` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\). The function then performs some unspecified operation based on `n` and the list `a`, and returns the result of that operation.
