Output State: **`p[i]' is equal to `mex - a[i]'**.

Explanation: The code `p[i] = mex - a[i]` assigns the value of `mex - a[i]` to `p[i]`. Here, `mex` and `a[i]` are assumed to be previously defined variables. The value of `p[i]` is now updated to be the difference between `mex` and `a[i]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
