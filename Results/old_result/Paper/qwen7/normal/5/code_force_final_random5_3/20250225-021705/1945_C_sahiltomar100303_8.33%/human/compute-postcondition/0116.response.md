Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, `trightOne` is decremented by 1, and either `tleftZero` or `trightOne` must meet the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)`**

Explanation: The value of `trightOne` is decremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state, including the condition involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne`.
