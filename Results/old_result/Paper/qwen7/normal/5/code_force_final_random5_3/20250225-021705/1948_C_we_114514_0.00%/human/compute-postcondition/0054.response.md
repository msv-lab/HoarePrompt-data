Postcondition: `results` is an empty list, `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is either False or remains unchanged, and `j` is `n`. Since the if condition `j == n - 1` does not change the values of `results`, `reachable_second_row`, `reachable_first_row`, and `j`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
