Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ur` is 2, and `ul` equals `ur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. However, the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` remain unchanged from their previous states. The only additional information is that we have broken out of the loop or conditional block.
