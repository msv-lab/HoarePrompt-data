Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `n` must be greater than `mid`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0'; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` was previously increased by 1 before this line of code, it means `rightOne` has been incremented twice. However, the initial state does not specify an exact value for `rightOne`, only that it was increased by 1 prior to this line. Therefore, we can say `rightOne` is increased by 1 again, making it `rightOne + 1` from its previous state.

All other variables (`i`, `n`, and the character at index `i` in string `s`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
