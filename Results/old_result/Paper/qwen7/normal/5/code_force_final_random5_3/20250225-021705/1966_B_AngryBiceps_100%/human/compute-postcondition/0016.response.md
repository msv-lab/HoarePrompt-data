Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the first input from the user and the second element is the second input from the user, `first_row` is the first element of the list `a` plus the first element of the last sublist in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last sublist in the list `a` plus the last element of the last sublist in the list `a` plus the last element of the last sublist in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments the value of `last_row` by the last element of the last sublist in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list containing two sublists, and each sublist contains two elements, `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last element of the last sublist, which is the second element of the second sublist. Therefore, `last_row` is updated to its original value plus this second element.
