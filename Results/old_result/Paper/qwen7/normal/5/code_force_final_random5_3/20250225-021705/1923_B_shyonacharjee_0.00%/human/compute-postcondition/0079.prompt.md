Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `success` is True, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `bullets_needed` is `health` for the last monster in the list, `position` is the position of the last monster in the list, `health` is the health of the last monster in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` and `k` are input integers, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `success` is False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters plus `bullets_needed`, `i` is `n-2`, `bullets_needed` is the `health` of the current monster, `position` is the position of the current monster, `health` is the health of the current monster, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is `distance`, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `success` remains False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters plus `bullets_needed` - `bullets_needed`, `i` is decremented by 1, `bullets_needed` is the `health` of the current monster, `position` is the `position` of the current monster, `health` is the `health` of the current monster, `time_available` is now equal to `distance`, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions, the current `position` and `health` are assigned from the tuple `monsters[i]`, and either the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `distance` is equal to `abs(position)`, `success` remains False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters plus the health of the current monster, `i` is n-1, `bullets_needed` is the `health` of the current monster.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
