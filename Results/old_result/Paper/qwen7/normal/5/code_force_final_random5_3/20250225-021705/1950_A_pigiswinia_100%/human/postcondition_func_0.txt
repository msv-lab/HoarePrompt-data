The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 0 to 9. For each test case, it determines whether the integers form a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if \(a < b > c\)), or neither ('NONE'). After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.
