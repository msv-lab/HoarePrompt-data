Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, considering both the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.
- The annotated program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used in the code, but `c` is never defined in the problem statement. The correct variable to use for the promotional price is `b`.
- The logic in the code compares `a * b` (the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price) with `a * d` (the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotional price), which is incorrect because `d` is set to `c / 2` instead of `b / 2`.
- The correct logic should compare `a * b / 2` (cost of buying two yogurts at the promotional price) with `a * n` (cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price).

Given these points, the annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
