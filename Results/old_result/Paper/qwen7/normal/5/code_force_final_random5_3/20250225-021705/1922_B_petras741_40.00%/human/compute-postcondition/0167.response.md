Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The initial value of `j` is given as `n + 1`. For the loop to start executing, `j` must be within the range specified by `range(1, eta_ln)`.

3. **Determine the Initial Value of `eta_ln`**: The value of `eta_ln` is given as the length of `eta`. This value does not change during the loop execution and is already known.

4. **Check the Range Condition**: For the loop to execute, `j` must be in the range from 1 to `eta_ln` (exclusive). Since `j` starts at `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `n + 1` is less than `eta_ln`.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `j` is set to `n + 1` and that `n + 1` is less than `eta_ln`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be `n + 1`.
- `n + 1` must be less than `eta_ln`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `eta_ln` must be greater than `n + 1`**
