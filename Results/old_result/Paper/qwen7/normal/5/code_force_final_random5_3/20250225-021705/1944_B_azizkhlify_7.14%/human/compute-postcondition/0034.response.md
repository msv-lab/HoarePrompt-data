The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must become 1. Therefore, `i` must be set to 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**
