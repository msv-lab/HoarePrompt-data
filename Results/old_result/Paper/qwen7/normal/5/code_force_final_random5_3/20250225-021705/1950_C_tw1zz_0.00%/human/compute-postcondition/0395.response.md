Based on the initial state provided:

- `h1` is either '01' or a value between '02' to '23' (inclusive).
- `m1` is equal to the string `m` from the user's input split by `:`.
- `time` is 'AM'.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `h1` will be one of the valid hour values ('01', '02', ..., '23').
- `m` is the minute part of the time entered by the user, split by `:`. For example, if the user inputs "12:34", `m` would be '34'.
- `time` is explicitly given as 'AM'.

Given the `sep=''` parameter in the `print` function, the values will be printed without any separators between them, except for the colon (`:`) and the space (` `).

So, the output will be a string combining `h1`, `m`, and `time` with appropriate delimiters.

Output: **h1:m m AM (where h1 is either '01', '02', ..., '23' and m is the minute part of the user's input)**
