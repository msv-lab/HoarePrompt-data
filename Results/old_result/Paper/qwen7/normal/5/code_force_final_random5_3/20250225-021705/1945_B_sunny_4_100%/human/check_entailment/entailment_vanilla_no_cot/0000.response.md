Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has an error in its logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. The formula `ans = m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the overlaps between the intervals where fireworks are launched by the two installations.

To find the correct solution, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks at the same time. The correct approach involves using the LCM to adjust the calculation of the number of fireworks visible.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation
        A = (m + lcm_ab - 1) // lcm_ab
        B = (m + lcm_ab - 1) // lcm_ab
        
        # Calculate the total number of unique times fireworks are launched
        total_times = (m + lcm_ab - 1) // lcm_ab
        
        # The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
        max_visible = A + B - total_times + 1
        
        print(max_visible)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected function should provide the right answer by properly accounting for the overlaps and ensuring the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is calculated accurately.
