Output State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is the first element of `num_list`; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{x: 1}`; `x` is not in `num_of_lens`.**

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Since `x` was initially not in `num_of_lens`, it is now added to the dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
