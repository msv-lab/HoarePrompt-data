### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly uses the provided functions to read the input.
   - `func_1()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2()` reads the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3()` reads the permutation `p`.

2. **Permutation Mapping:**
   - The code creates a dictionary `num_indx` that maps each number in the permutation to its index.
   - This mapping helps in quickly finding the index of any number in the permutation.

3. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The code initializes `left` and `right` to 0 and `n` respectively.
   - It performs a binary search to find the position where `x` should be placed.
   - During the binary search, it updates `left` and `right` based on the comparison of `p[mid]` with `x`.

4. **Swapping Logic:**
   - After the binary search, the code checks if `p[left]` is equal to `x`.
   - If not, it checks if `x` is present in the permutation but not at the correct position.
   - If `x` is not found at the correct position, it finds the first missing index (`temp[0]`) and swaps it with `x` and then with `left`.
   - This ensures that `p[left]` becomes `x` after the binary search.

5. **Output:**
   - The code prints the number of swaps performed and the indices of the swaps.

Given the detailed analysis, the annotated code correctly implements the required logic to rearrange the permutation using at most two swaps to ensure that `p[left]` equals `x` after performing the binary search. The code follows the problem description accurately and performs the necessary operations to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the provided code correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.
