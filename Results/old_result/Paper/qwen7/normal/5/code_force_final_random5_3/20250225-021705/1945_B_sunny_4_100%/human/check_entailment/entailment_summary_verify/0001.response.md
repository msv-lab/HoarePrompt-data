### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes, and from the second installation every `b` minutes. Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period of `m` minutes using integer division (`m // a` and `m // b`).
   - The formula used is `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`. This formula is derived from the fact that we need to account for the possibility of fireworks being launched at the exact same time (i.e., at `m` minutes).

3. **Correctness of the Formula**:
   - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` accounts for the following:
     - `m // a` gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within `m` minutes.
     - `m // b` gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within `m` minutes.
     - Adding `2` accounts for the possibility of fireworks from both installations being launched at the exact same time (at `m` minutes), which would otherwise be counted twice if we just added the two results together.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases well, such as when `a` or `b` is equal to `m`, ensuring that the calculation includes all possible simultaneous launches.

5. **Verification Using Function Summary**:
   - The function summary indicates that the function processes up to 10,000 test cases, where for each test case, it takes three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) as input. It calculates the value of \( \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2 \) and prints the result. This aligns with the provided solution.

6. **Validation of the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is appropriate for calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - The solution handles all edge cases appropriately, including scenarios where `a` or `b` equals `m`.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

### Final Evaluation:
