Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are strings containing the values split from the input.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into four parts and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. Since the input is split, these variables now hold string values corresponding to the respective parts of the input. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
