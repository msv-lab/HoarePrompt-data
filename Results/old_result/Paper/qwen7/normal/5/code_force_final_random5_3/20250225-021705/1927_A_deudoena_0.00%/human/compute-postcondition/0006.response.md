Output State: **`j` is equal to 'B', `ind1` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `ind1` is assigned the value of `i`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, `ind1` is simply set to whatever value `i` holds. All other variables retain their initial values, so `j` remains equal to 'B'.
