Output State: **`cur` is the second-to-last element of `N`, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces without its last element, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`, and `M[cur]` is set to `1`.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` remains unchanged as it is the second-to-last element of `N`. The variable `i` remains 0, `S` is still an input integer, `T` is still 1, `N` is still a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces without its last element, `M` is still a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`, and now `M[cur]` is set to `1`.
