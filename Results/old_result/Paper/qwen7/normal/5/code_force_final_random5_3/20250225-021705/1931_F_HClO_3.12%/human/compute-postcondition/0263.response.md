Postcondition: `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, and `val` is either an empty list or a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `idx2`, and all other variables retain their original values. Otherwise, `a3` is the first integer entered, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers entered, and `m` is decremented by 1.
