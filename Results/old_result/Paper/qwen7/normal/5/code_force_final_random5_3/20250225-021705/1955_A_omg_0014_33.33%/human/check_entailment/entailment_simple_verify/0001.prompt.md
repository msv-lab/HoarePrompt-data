You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer that was initially provided and must be greater than 0, i is equal to n - 1 (after all iterations of the loop), a, b, and c are integers obtained from the input split during each iteration, d is equal to c / 2 for each iteration, and the loop has printed either a * b or round(a * d) for each iteration based on the condition a * b < a * d.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` (which should be `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively).

2. **Promotion Price Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is supposed to represent the price per yogurt when bought in pairs under the promotion.
   - This calculation is correct.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The program compares `a * b` (the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price) with `a * d` (the cost of buying all yogurts at the promotion price).
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Promotion Price Calculation**:
   - The variable `c` in the code represents `b` (the price for two yogurts), not `n` (the number of yogurts).
   - Therefore, `d = c / 2` should be `d = b / 2`.

2. **Rounding Issue**:
   - The program uses `round(a * d)` to round the result of the promotion price calculation.
   - However, since `d` is already a floating-point division (`b / 2`), rounding might not always give the minimum cost. For example, if `b / 2` results in a non-integer value, rounding might lead to an incorrect minimum cost.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        d = b / 2
        total_cost_regular = n * a
        total_cost_promotion = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        print(min(total_cost_regular, total_cost_promotion))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - Iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Price Calculation**:
   - Calculates `d` as `b / 2`, which is the price for one yogurt when bought in pairs under the promotion.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - `total_cost_regular` calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - `total_cost_promotion` calculates the cost if the maximum number of yogurts are bought at the promotion price, and any remaining yogurts are bought at the regular price.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the minimum of the two calculated costs.

### Conclusion:

The original program has issues with the promotion price calculation and rounding. The corrected program addresses these issues and should provide the correct output.

**Correctness: False**
