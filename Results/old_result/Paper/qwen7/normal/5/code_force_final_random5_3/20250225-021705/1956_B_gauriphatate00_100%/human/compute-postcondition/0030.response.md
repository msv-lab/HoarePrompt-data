Output State: **`max_score` is 1, `num` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and `num` (now 2) must be in `count_a`**

The code `max_score += 1` increments the value of `max_score` by 1. Initially, `max_score` is 0, so after executing this line, `max_score` becomes 1. The values of `num` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `num` (which is now 2) must be in `count_a` also remains valid.
