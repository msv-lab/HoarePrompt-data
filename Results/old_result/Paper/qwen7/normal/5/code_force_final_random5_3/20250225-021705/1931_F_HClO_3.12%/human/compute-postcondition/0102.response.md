Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, the value of `val` is an empty list, and the condition `idx1 <= idx2` holds true, and `m` is equal to 2.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the conditions. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
