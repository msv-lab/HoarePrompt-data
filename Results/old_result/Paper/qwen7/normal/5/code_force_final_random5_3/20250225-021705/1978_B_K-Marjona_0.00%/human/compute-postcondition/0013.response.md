Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of remaining test cases, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**

The code assigns the value of the minimum between `n` and `b - a` to `k`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
