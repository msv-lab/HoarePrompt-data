Postcondition: **The list `r` will contain counts of how many times each index from the array `a` appears within the range `[n, 2*n)`. Specifically, `r[j]` will hold the count of how many times `a[i]` equals `j+1` for `i` in the range `[n, 2*n)`. The value of `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. The variables `res`, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` will remain unchanged from their initial state.**
