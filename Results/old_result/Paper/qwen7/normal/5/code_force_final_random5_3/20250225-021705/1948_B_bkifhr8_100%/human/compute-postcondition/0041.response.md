Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True, `i` is 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.**
