Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Initialization and Calculation of `dist`**: 
   - The variable `dist` is initialized to `abs(n / 2)`, but it should be initialized to `abs((n - 1) / 2)` because the position `i` is 1-based.
   - The value `30001` is used as a large constant to represent an invalid distance, but it might not cover all edge cases.

2. **Logic for Checking Conditions**:
   - The logic to check if the current position satisfies the conditions is flawed. Specifically, the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` should be checked separately and updated accordingly.

3. **Updating `ans` and `b_d`**:
   - The logic to update `ans` and `b_d` inside the loop is incorrect. It should ensure that both conditions are met before updating `ans`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        input_string = input()
        arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
        z = arr.count(0)
        o = arr.count(1)
        z_r = z
        o_r = o
        z_l = 0
        o_l = 0
        dist = abs((n - 1) / 2)
        ans = 0
        b_d = dist
        
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 0:
                z_l += 1
                z_r -= 1
            else:
                o_l += 1
                o_r -= 1
            
            if z_r >= 0 and o_r >= 0 and (z_l >= math.ceil(z_l / 2) and o_r >= math.ceil(o_r / 2)) and (b_d > abs((n - 1) / 2 - i - 1)):
                ans = i + 1
                b_d = abs((n - 1) / 2 - i - 1)
        
        print(ans)
        t -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions are properly checked and the optimal position is determined correctly.
