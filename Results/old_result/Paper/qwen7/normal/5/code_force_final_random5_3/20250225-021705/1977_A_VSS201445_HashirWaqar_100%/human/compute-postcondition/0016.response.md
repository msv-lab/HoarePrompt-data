Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user, splits them based on whitespace, and converts them to integers. It then assigns these integers to `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds a positive integer between 1 and 100.
