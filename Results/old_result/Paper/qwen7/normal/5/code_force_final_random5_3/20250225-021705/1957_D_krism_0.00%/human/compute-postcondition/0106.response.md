Output State: **`j` is 0; `c` is an integer where the result of `(c >> j & 1)` is 0; `pre[j][0]` is 1; `suf[j][0]` is 0**

Explanation: The code subtracts 1 from `suf[j][0]`. Given that `j` is 0, `suf[0][0]` was initially 1 (from the initial state). After executing `suf[j][0] -= 1`, `suf[0][0]` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
