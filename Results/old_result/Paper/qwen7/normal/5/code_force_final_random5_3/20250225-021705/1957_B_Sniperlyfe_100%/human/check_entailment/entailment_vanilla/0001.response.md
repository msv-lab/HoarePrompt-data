Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function constructs an array `nums` of length `n` initialized to zeros.
   - It sets `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1. For example, if `k = 5`, `k.bit_length()` is 3, and `(1 << 2) - 1` is 3 (binary `11`).
   - It then adjusts `k` by subtracting this value from `k`.
   - It iterates through the rest of the array (`i` from 1 to `n-1`):
     - If `k` is greater than 0, it sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`.
     - It decreases `k` by the value assigned to `nums[i]`.
   - Finally, it adjusts `nums[0]` by adding the remaining value of `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of `func_1` for each test case and prints them out.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Sum Condition**:
   - The sum of the numbers should be `k`. The code ensures that the sum is correct because `nums[0]` is adjusted at the end to make sure the total sum is `k`.

2. **Bitwise OR Condition**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements.
   - The initial value of `nums[0]` is chosen to be the largest possible number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1. This ensures that the first element contributes significantly to the OR result.
   - Subsequent elements are set to `nums[0] + 1` when possible, which further increases the number of 1s in the OR result.
   - The adjustments ensure that the sum condition is met while maximizing the number of 1s in the OR result.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 1`, `k = 5`
  - `nums[0] = 5` (since `5` is the largest number with 3 bits set to 1).
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - `nums[0] = 3` (since `3` is the largest number with 2 bits set to 1).
  - `nums[1] = 0` (since `k` is already 0 after setting `nums[0]`).
  - Output: `3 0`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 2`, `k = 5`
  - `nums[0] = 3` (since `3` is the largest number with 2 bits set to 1).
  - `nums[1] = 2` (since `k = 2` after setting `nums[0]`).
  - Output: `3 2`

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 6`, `k = 51`
  - `nums[0] = 31` (since `31` is the largest number with 5 bits set to 1).
  - `nums[1] = 1` (since `k = 20` after setting `nums[0]`).
  - `nums[2] = 1` (since `k = 18` after setting `nums[1]`).
  - `nums[3] = 32` (since `k = 6` after setting `nums[1]` and `nums[2]`).
  - `nums[4] = 2` (since `k = 4` after setting `nums[3]`).
  - `nums[5] = 12` (since `k = 0` after setting `nums[4]`).
  - Output: `31 1 1 32 2 12`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence while ensuring the sum condition is met. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
