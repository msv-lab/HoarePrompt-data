Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, respectively, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftOne` is `0`, and `right` is `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` starting from index `mid` to `right`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, and `leftOne` is either `0` or `1`, depending on whether the last character `s[right]` was '0' or '1', `right` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `right` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`, and either `tleftZero` or `trightOne` must meet the condition `(tleftZero < (right) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right) // 2)`. In both cases (whether `s[right] == '0'` or not), `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted: `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[right] == '0'`, and `trightOne` is decremented by 1 regardless of the value of `s[right]`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `right` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `n`; either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` still holds true; if `s[right] == '0'`, then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
