Postcondition: `i` is less than or equal to `n-1`, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, `n` remains unchanged, and `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 6 if the loop executed 3 times, 8 if the loop executed 4 times, and so on until `i` reaches `n-1`. If at any point `ul == k * 2`, the loop breaks early and `i` may be less than `n-1`. The if condition evaluates to true.
