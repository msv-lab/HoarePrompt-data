You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case contains two integers n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a[i]` will be either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1 for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The variable `x` will be 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise it will be 2. The list `b` will be updated such that for every `i` from 1 to `n`, `b[i]` will be the sum of `b[i-1]` and `x`. Specifically, `b[i]` will be the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i=1` to `i`. The variable `i` will be `n` after the loop completes, and `b[n+1]` will be `b[n] + x` where `x` is determined by `a[n]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `b[i]` will hold the total count of occurrences where `a[i]` was greater than 1 up to index `i`, and `b[n+1]` will be the final count including the last iteration.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `q` will be 0 (since it starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0), `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers input during the loop's final iteration. The program will print 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or if `x == y`, otherwise it will print 'YES'. The variables `a`, `b`, and `i` will reflect their final states after all iterations, with `i` being `n` (the total number of elements in the list `a`), and `b[n+1]` being `b[n] + x` where `x` is determined by the final value of `a[n]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after running the loop through all its iterations, `q` will be zero, and the program will make its final decision ('NO' or 'YES') based on the last inputs `x` and `y`, using the updated lists `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an array `a` of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it compares the sum of elements in a specified subarray with a cumulative count related to those elements. If the sum of the subarray is less than the cumulative count or if the query indices are the same, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function ultimately prints the result for each query and does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem description. Specifically, the program uses a fixed value `x` (either 1 or 2) to calculate the sum of `b`, which does not take into account the requirement that all elements in `b` must be distinct from the corresponding elements in `a`. Additionally, the program does not check if the sum of the subarray matches the sum of the corresponding segment in `b`.

For example, consider the following subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` from the provided input. The subarray from index 1 to 3 (i.e., `[2, 1, 4]`) should be checked. According to the problem description, a valid `b` array for this subarray could be `[3, 1, 6]` (where the sum of `b` is equal to the sum of the subarray and all elements in `b` are distinct and positive). However, the program does not generate such a `b` array and instead uses a fixed increment, leading to incorrect results.
