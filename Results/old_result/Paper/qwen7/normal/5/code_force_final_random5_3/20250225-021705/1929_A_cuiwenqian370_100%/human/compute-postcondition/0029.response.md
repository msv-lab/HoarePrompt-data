Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `index` is set such that there are enough elements in `data` to create the required arrays.
- `results` list contains at least one element.

The `print(result)` statement will print the first element of the `results` list because it is mentioned that `results` contains at least one element. Since no specific value is given for the elements in `results`, we can only refer to the first element generically.

Output: **the first element of results**
