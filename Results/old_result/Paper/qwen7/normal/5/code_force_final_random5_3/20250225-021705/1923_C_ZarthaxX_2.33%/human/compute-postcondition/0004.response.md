State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `i` is 1**.

Explanation:
- The loop starts with `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
- For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 1.
- The values of `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` do not directly affect whether the loop can start; they are just the initial states of the program before the loop begins.
- Therefore, the only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted is `i` to be 1, ensuring the loop can start executing.
