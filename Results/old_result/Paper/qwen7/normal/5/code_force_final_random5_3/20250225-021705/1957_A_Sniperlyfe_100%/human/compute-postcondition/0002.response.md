Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `n` and `arr`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. The variable `n` takes the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration.
3. **Determine the Initial State**: Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks, and `freq` is an empty dictionary.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can execute. For the loop to start, `arr` must contain at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `arr` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary**
