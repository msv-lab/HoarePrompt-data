Output State: **`cnt` is 2*n - 8, `i` is 10, `m` must be greater than 10, `x` is -79, `y` is 100**

Explanation: The code updates `cnt` by adding the result of `x // y + (i > 1)` to its current value. Here, `x // y` is `-8` because `-79 // 100` is `0` (integer division), and `0 + 1` (since `i > 1` is `True`) equals `1`. So, `cnt` becomes `2*n - 8`. The values of `i`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
