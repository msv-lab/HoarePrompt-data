Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `res` is a non-empty list of elements from `a` where the corresponding index in `l` is 1.
- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in res:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is taken from the list `res`.
   - No other variables are involved in the loop head.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `res` must contain at least one element.
   - Since `res` is a non-empty list at the end of the previous iteration, it means there is at least one element in `res`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `res`, as it is the source of the loop variable `i`.
   - After processing one element from `res`, `res` will have at least one fewer element (assuming the loop body does not add or remove elements from `res`).

### Conclusion
Since `res` is a non-empty list at the end of the previous iteration, after one iteration, `res` will still be a non-empty list, but it will have one fewer element. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

### Final Answer
State: **`res` is a non-empty list of elements from `a` where the corresponding index in `l` is 1, and it has one fewer element than before**.
