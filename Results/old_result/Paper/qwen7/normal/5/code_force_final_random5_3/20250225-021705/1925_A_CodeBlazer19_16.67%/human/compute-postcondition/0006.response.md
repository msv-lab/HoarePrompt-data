Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(97, k + 97)`. The variable `j` is being iterated over this range.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\)
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is the first integer input by the user
   - `k` is the second integer input by the user
   - `s` is a string containing the character 'a'
   - `j` is 97 (since it starts from 97)

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `k + 97`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**: Since `j` starts at 97 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 97. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 98. Therefore, `j` should be 98 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the other states**: The other states (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `s`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is a string containing the character 'a', `j` is 98**
