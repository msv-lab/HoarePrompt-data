Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis:
The problem description seems to be incomplete or unclear from the provided code snippet. However, we can infer that the main function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` is supposed to create `.py` files (specifically `ac.py` and `wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in directories whose names fall within a specified range of integers.

### Code Analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Directory Scanning:**
   - The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` is defined correctly.
   - It uses `os.getcwd()` to get the current working directory.
   - It scans all subdirectories in the current directory using `os.scandir()` and checks if their names are digits and fall within the specified range (`start` to `end`).

2. **HTML File Processing:**
   - For each subdirectory whose name matches the criteria, it lists all `.html` files using `os.listdir()`.
   - It prints the number of `.html` files in each matching subdirectory.
   - For each `.html` file in these subdirectories, it creates two new files: `ac.py` and `wa.py`.

3. **File Creation:**
   - The files are created using `open(file_path, 'w').close()`, which effectively creates an empty file.

4. **Main Function Execution:**
   - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block calls `generate_files_for_html_in_range(1951, 1980)` with specific start and end values.

### Provided Additional Function:
- There is an additional function `func_1()` defined, but it does not seem to be used anywhere in the provided code. This function appears to be unrelated to the main functionality described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided code, the function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` performs the intended task of creating `.py` files for each `.html` file in subdirectories whose names are within the specified integer range. The additional function `func_1()` is not relevant to this task and does not affect the correctness of the main function.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
