Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `len` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `len = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `len`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
