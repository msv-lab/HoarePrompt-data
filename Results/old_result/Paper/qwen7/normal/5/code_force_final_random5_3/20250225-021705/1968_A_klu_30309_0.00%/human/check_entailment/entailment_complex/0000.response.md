Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates over all possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) and if \( 2y \ge x \). If both conditions are met, it immediately returns \( y \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the last \( y \) that was checked, which is stored in `max_val`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For other values of \( x \), the function correctly identifies the largest \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), the function finds \( y = 5 \) because \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - For \( x = 21 \), the function finds \( y = 18 \) because \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 27 \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - For \( x = 100 \), the function finds \( y = 98 \) because \( \gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 148 \), which is the maximum possible value.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic of the function correctly identifies the largest \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given constraints.
   - The function handles edge cases appropriately and returns the correct values as per the examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
