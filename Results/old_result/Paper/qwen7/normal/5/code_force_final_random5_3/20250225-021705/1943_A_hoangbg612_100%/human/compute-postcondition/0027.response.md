Output State: **`M[cur]` is incremented by 1, `cur` remains unchanged if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`, otherwise `cur` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The value of `cur` remains unchanged unless the condition `num > cur + 1` is met, in which case `cur` is increased by 1. Since the initial conditions state that `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`, and `cur` is increased by 1 if `num > cur + 1`, the output state reflects these changes while keeping the rest of the initial conditions intact.
