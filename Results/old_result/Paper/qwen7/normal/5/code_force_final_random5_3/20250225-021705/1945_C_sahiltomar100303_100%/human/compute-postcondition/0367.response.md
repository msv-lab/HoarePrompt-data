Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 (i.e., `rightZero` is now `rightZero + 1`).**

This means that the value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
