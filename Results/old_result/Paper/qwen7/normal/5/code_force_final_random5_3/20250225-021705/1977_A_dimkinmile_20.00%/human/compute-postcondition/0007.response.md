Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case consisting of two positive integers n and m where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (t is not explicitly passed as a parameter but implied by the context). It returns a value based on the relationship between n and m.**

Note: The function does not accept any parameters directly, but it implies processing a test case which includes two integers n and m within specified ranges, and potentially a third integer t (though not explicitly mentioned in the parameter list) also within a specified range.
