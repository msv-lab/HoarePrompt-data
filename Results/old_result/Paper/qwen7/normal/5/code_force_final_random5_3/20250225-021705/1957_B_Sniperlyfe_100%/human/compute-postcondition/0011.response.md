Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `nums[1]`, and `nums[1]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, `nums[2]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `nums[2]` to be the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `nums[1]` remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
