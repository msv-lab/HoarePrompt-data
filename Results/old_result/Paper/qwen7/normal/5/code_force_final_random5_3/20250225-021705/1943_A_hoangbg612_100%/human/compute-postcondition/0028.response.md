Postcondition: `cur` is an index in the list `N`, and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`. If `num > cur`, `cur` is increased by 1. If `num > cur - 1`, `M[cur-1]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur-1` or `num <= cur`. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is set to 1 and `cur` remains unchanged if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`, otherwise `cur` is increased by 1.
