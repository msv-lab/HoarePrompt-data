Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `x` which is iterating over the string `c`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `counter` is increased by 1.
   - `c` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter than before.
   - `x` is the next character in `c`.
   - `no` is `False`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `c` must still be a non-empty string.
   - Since `x` is the next character in `c`, `c` must still contain at least one more character.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `c` must be a non-empty string but one character shorter than before.
   - `x` must be the next character in the updated `c`.
   - `no` remains `False` as it is not affected by the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`counter` is increased by 1, `c` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter than before, `x` is the next character in `c`, `no` is False**.
