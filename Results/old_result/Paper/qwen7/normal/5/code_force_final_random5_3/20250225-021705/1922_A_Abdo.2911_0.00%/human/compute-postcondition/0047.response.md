Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either lowercase or not lowercase; `match_a_b` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and the character at index `i` in `template`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `match_a_b` remains `False`.
