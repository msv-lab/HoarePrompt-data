Output State: **`N` is a list containing all elements except the one that was just processed (which is `num`), `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 to become 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is not broken since the condition `num > cur + 1` is not specified to be checked here.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` simply increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1, making it 1. No other changes are made to the variables or conditions specified in the initial state.
