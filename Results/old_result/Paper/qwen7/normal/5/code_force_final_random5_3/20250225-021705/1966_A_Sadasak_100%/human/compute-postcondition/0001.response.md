Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `num`, which iterates over the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: Since `num` is being assigned each element from the list `arr` during each iteration, the initial value of `num` is not specified. However, we know that the loop will start with the first element of `arr`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `arr`**: The list `arr` contains integers representing the numbers on the cards. For the loop to start, `arr` must contain at least one element.

4. **Determine the state of `frequency_table`**: The `frequency_table` is initially an empty dictionary. The loop body is omitted, but since the loop will assign values to `num`, it doesn't affect the initial state of `frequency_table`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element for the loop to start executing. The initial value of `num` will be the first element of `arr`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must have at least one element.
- `num` will be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
