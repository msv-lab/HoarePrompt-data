Postcondition: **`j` is greater than 1002, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001, `rho` and `res` are increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. If `j` is greater than 1000, `rho` and `res` are further increased by the same amount and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**
