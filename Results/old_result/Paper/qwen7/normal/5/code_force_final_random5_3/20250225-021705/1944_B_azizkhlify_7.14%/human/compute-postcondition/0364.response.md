Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ur` is 2, and `ul` equals `ur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented from its current value.
   - Since `i` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `n + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `2 * n`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be incremented to `n + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

So, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
