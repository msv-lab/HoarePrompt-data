Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(26):
        if char_count[j] == a[i]:
            s += chr(j + ord('a'))
            char_count[j] += 1
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 0, `j` is 26, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is 'bab...z', `char_count[2]` is equal to 26, and the loop has completed all its iterations.

Explanation: Given the loop runs for 26 iterations (as indicated by `range(26)`), and each iteration increments the character count and appends the corresponding character to `s`, after all iterations, `i` will remain 0 (since it is not incremented within the loop), `j` will be 26 (after completing the last iteration), `s` will be the string 'bab...z' (appending characters based on the counts in `char_count`), and `char_count[2]` will be 26 (since 'b' was the second character and it was appended 26 times).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 25, `j` is 25, `n` is 26, `s` is 'bab...zAbbCdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzaaaabbbbccccdddd....zzzz', `char_count[2]` is 27, `char_count[3]` is 29.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 26, `j` is 2, `n` is 26, `s` is 'bab...zAbbCdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzaaaabbbbccccdddd....zzzzbzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `char_count[2]` is 27, `char_count[3]` is 32.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` remains unchanged at 26 because the loop only modifies `j` and updates the string `s` and `char_count[j]`. The variable `j` cycles through the range from 0 to 25, and for each iteration, it checks if `char_count[j]` matches `a[i]`. In this case, `a[i]` is 'z', which corresponds to `char_count[25]`. Since `char_count[25]` does not match `a[i]`, the loop continues until it finds `char_count[2]` (which is 'b' in the alphabet) matching `a[i]` on the third iteration. After finding the match, it increments `char_count[2]` by 1, appends 'b' to the string `s`, and breaks out of the loop. This process repeats for all characters in the alphabet, resulting in the final state where `j` wraps around to 2 (indicating the end of the alphabet), and `char_count[3]` is incremented to 32.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
