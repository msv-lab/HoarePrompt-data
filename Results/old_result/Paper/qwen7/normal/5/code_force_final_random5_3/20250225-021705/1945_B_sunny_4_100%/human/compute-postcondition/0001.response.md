Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 is maintained, and now `t` also holds the value of the input integer. All other variables (A, B, a, b, m) are not yet defined and their values are unknown.
