Output State: **`a` is `a + f`, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `i` is less than `m` and equal to `i + 1`, `k` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `u` is updated to the first input integer, `v` is updated to the second input integer, `f` is updated to the third input integer, `a` is increased by `f`.**

Explanation: The code `a += f` updates the value of `a` by adding `f` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or updated states.
