Postcondition: **`i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `ptsb` contains the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` contains the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + (k - i - 1) * s[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, and `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`. Additionally, `maxs` is now strictly less than `maxb`.**
