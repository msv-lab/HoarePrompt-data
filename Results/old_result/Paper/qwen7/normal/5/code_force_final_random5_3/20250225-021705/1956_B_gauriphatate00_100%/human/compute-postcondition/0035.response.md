Output State: **`max_score` is 2, `num` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `num` (which is now 3) must be in `count_a`.**

The value of `max_score` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `num` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `num` must be in `count_a` is still valid.
