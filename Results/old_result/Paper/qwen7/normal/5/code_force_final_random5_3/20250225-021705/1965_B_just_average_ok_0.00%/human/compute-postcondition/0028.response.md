Output State: **`idx` is 4, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` must be at least 8, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 3, so after executing this line, `idx` becomes 4. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `nums` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
