Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) and calculates the number of steps (`t`) required to reduce `x` to 1 by repeatedly dividing `x` by 2 when it is even or decrementing `x` by 1 when it is odd. It then generates a list `ans` containing alternating values starting from a high initial value and decreasing by 1 each time until a low value, reflecting the operations performed. Finally, it prints the total number of steps `t` and the list `ans` in reverse order.**
