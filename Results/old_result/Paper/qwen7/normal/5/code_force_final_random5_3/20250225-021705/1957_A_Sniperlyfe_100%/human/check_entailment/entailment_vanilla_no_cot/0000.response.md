Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the number of regular polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3, which is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that different types of polygons can be formed (e.g., triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.). The correct approach would be to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all stick lengths to determine the largest possible side length for a polygon that can be formed using all sticks without breaking any, and then calculate how many such polygons can be formed.
