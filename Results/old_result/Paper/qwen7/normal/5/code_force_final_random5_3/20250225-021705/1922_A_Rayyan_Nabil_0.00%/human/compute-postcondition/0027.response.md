Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'YES'**.

Explanation: The code `c = input()` assigns the input from the user to the variable `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
