Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums`. It calculates the mean value based on the sum of the elements in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`. It then checks if the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean remains non-negative throughout the iteration. If the cumulative sum ever becomes negative, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES', indicating that the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean is always greater than or equal to 0.**
