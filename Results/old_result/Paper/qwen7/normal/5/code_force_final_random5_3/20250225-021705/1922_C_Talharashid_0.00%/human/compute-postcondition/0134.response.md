Output State: **`start` is the input integer - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is either `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` or `abs(d2[end] - d1[start])`, `i` is 2, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d2[end])`**

Explanation: The value of `start` is decremented by 1, making it one less than the original input integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
