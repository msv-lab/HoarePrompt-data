Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list of integers \( a \). It computes the cumulative XOR of elements in the list \( a \) and then calculates a specific value based on the counts of 0s and 1s in certain bit positions. The function ultimately returns the computed value \( ans \).**
