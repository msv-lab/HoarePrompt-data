Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either -1 or `i`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
