Output State: **`i` is now the value of `num`, which is `max(big) + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `i` was being checked against the list `no`. The value of `i` (which is now stored in `num`) remains unchanged, and the condition that `i` is not in the list `no` is no longer checked. Therefore, the only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
