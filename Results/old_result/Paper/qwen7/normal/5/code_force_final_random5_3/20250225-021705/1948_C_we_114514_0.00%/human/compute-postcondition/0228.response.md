Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case processed. Given that the loop has executed all iterations and the final state indicates `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n`, and test_case may be either empty or contain 'NO', with `row1` and `row2` being empty lists, it means that for every test case, the condition to reach the second row (`reachable_second_row`) was satisfied by the end of the loop. Therefore, the `results` list will contain 'YES' for each test case, assuming there were no 'NO' cases that would change the outcome.

In simpler terms, the `results` list will be a list of 'YES' entries, one for each test case, indicating that for every test case, it was possible to reach the second row based on the conditions specified in the loop.
