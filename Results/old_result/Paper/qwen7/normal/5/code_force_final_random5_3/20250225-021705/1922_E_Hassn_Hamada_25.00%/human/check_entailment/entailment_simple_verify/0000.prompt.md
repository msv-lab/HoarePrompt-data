You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Since `number` must be at least 31, the loop will run 5 times, setting `i` to 4 each time. The `sequence` list will contain 5 elements, all of which are 4.

    #State: Output State: `size` is 5, `i` is 7, `sequence` is undefined, `result` is undefined.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - 1`, which means it will run 5 times since `size` is initially 5. After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `i` becomes 4. After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `i` becomes 5. After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `i` becomes 6. Following this pattern, after the fourth iteration (`i = 3`), `i` becomes 7. Since the loop modifies `sequence` and `result` based on the current value of `i`, and these modifications are not defined beyond the third iteration, we can conclude that `sequence` and `result` are undefined after the loop completes all its iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` attempts to generate a sequence based on the input `number`, but it does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- Input: `X = 37`

The program generates an array `[0, 0, 2, 3, -1, -1, 0]`. However, this array does not have exactly 37 increasing subsequences. For instance, the subsequence `[0, 2, 3]` is counted multiple times due to the presence of `-1` values, which do not contribute to increasing subsequences but complicate the counting logic.

A correct implementation would need to carefully manage the generation of the array to ensure that the exact number of increasing subsequences matches `X`. The current approach does not guarantee this, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
