Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - (2 * 2 - 2)`, `y` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `y = i * i` assigns the value of `i * i` to `y`. Given that `i` is 2, `y` is calculated as `2 * 2`, which equals 4. The values of `cnt`, `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
