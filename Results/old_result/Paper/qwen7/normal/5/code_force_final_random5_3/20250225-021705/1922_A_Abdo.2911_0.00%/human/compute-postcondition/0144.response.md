Output State: **`match_a_b` is True**.

Explanation: The code `match_a_b = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `match_a_b`. This means that before the assignment, `match_a_b` was likely a boolean variable, and now it is explicitly set to `True`. The values of `i`, `n`, `template`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their previous states as described in the initial state.
