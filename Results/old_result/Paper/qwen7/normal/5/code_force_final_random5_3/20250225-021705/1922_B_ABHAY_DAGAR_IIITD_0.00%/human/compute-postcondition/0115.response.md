Output State: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary with the key `x` and value `1` (since `x` was incremented by 1), `x` is the first element of `num_list`, and the current value of `x` is in `num_of_lens`.**

This means that the value of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` has been updated to reflect that it has occurred once. All other variables remain in their respective states as described in the initial state.
