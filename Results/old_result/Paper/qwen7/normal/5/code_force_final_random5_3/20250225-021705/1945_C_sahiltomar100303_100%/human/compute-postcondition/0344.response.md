Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is greater than 1, `leftOne` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially 2 (based on the initial state), after executing the code, `leftOne` becomes 3. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
