Output State: The final value of `s` after the loop executes all its iterations is calculated as the cumulative sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`, plus the additional term `c * (k + m) * c * (k + m) * (m - k + 1) + c * a * m` if `m` is equal to or greater than `k + m`. The variable `i` will be `0` after the loop completes, `m` will be the total number of friend pairs across all test cases, `k` will be the total number of operations across all test cases, `n` will be the initial input integer, `M` will be 1000000007, `c` will be the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, and `a` will be the total sum of `f` for all friend pairs across all test cases.

This final state represents the complete computation after processing all test cases and operations as specified in the loop.
