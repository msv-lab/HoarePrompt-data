Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

The code `idx1 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values of `m`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n` are still valid as per the initial state.
