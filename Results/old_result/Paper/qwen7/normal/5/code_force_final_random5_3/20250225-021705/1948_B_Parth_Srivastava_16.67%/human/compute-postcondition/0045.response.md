Postcondition: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a`, `n` is the length of `c`. If there exists an index `i` greater than 0 where `a[i] > 10`, then `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `c` either contains the value of `a[i]` or has an additional element which is the same as the element at index `i` in `a`; `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`, and `n` is either incremented by 1 or `n + 2` depending on whether `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, then `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10, and `c` contains the value of `a[i]` with `n` being `n + 1` or `[x]` with `n` being `n + 2` depending on whether `y` is less than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `n` is incremented by 1 and `c` contains the value of `a[i]`.**
