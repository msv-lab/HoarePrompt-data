Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `j`. Since `j` was already 0, its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.
