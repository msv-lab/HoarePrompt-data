Output State: **`ones[i]` is 1, `ones[i - 1]` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except for the first element which is 1, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `ones[i]` to be the sum of `ones[i - 1]` and 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise it's just `ones[i - 1]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `ones[1]` (which is `ones[i]`) is set to `ones[0] + (1 if nums[0] == 1 else 0)`. Since `ones` starts with all zeros and `i` is 1, `ones[0]` is 0. Therefore, `ones[1]` becomes 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise it remains 0. However, since `i` is updated to 2 after this line of code, `i` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
