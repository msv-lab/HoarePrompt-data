Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` defined in the program do not address the requirements of the problem. Specifically, the problem requires distributing bets in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The functions defined seem to be related to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers using the greatest common divisor (GCD), which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any outcome. This can be achieved by setting each bet to a value that ensures the condition is met, given the multipliers provided.
