Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is an empty string.
   - `sum_value_digits` is the sum of digits of the original `i` (converted to integers).
   - `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to infinity (`range(1, inf)`).

3. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and `i` is currently an empty string, it means that the loop has not yet started or has just started.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to `1`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` needs to be set to `1`.
   - `sum_value_digits` remains the same as it was computed based on the previous value of `i` (which was an empty string).
   - `values[i]` will be calculated based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of digits of the original `i` (converted to integers), and `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`**.
