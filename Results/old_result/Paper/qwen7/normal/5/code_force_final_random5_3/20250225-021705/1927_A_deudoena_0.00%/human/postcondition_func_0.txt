The function processes a string `inpstr` containing characters 'W' and 'B', and calculates and prints the difference between the length of the string and the sum of the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string. If no 'B' is found, `ind1` remains 0. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated result.
