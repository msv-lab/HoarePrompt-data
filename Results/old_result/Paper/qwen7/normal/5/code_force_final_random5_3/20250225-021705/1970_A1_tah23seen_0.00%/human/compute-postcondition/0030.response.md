Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` is the value corresponding to key `n-1` in dictionary `d`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus the character at index `n-1` in string `s`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is updated to the next key in the dictionary `d`, which is `n-1`.
- The variable `j` is set to the corresponding value in the dictionary `d` for the key `n-1`.
- The variable `ans` is updated by adding the character at index `i` (which is `n-1`) in the string `s` to its previous value.
