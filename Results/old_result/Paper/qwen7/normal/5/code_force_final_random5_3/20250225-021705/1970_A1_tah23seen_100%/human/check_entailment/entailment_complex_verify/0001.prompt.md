You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the length of `s`, and `d[n]` is the final depth value calculated based on the parentheses in `s`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, and then by the negative first element of each tuple, `i` is the first element of the last tuple in `d`, `j` is the second element of the last tuple in `d`, and `ans` is the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in `d`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `d` remains sorted as initially described, `i` and `j` will refer to the last tuple in `d`, and `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of `s[i]` for all tuples `(i, j)` in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")`. It calculates the depth of each parenthesis in the string and stores these depths in a dictionary `d`. The dictionary is then sorted based on the depth values, and the function constructs a new string `ans` by concatenating the characters from `s` corresponding to the keys in the sorted dictionary. Finally, the function returns the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in the sorted dictionary `d`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   ```python
   n = input()
   print(func_1(n))
   ```
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
       n = len(s)
       ans = ''
       d = {}
       d[0] = 0
       for i in range(len(s)):
           if s[i] == '(':
               d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
           else:
               d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
       d.pop(n)
       d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
       for (i, j) in d:
           ans += s[i]
       return ans
   ```

   - **Initialization:**
     - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
     - `ans` is initialized as an empty string.
     - A dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`.

   - **Building the Balance Table:**
     - A loop iterates over each character in `s`.
     - For each character, it updates the balance in the dictionary `d`. If the character is '(', the balance increases; if it is ')', the balance decreases.

   - **Removing the Last Entry:**
     - `d.pop(n)` removes the entry corresponding to the last index `n`.

   - **Sorting the Dictionary:**
     - `d.items()` returns a list of tuples where each tuple is `(index, balance)`.
     - The list is sorted first by `balance` (in ascending order) and then by `-index` (in descending order).

   - **Constructing the Result String:**
     - The sorted items are iterated over, and the corresponding characters from the original string `s` are appended to `ans`.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

**Input:**
```
(()(()))
```

**Expected Output:**
```
()(()())
```

#### Execution Steps:

1. **Balance Calculation:**
   - `d` will be updated as follows:
     ```
     d = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 0, 7: -1}
     ```
   - After removing the last entry (`d.pop(7)`), `d` becomes:
     ```
     d = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 0}
     ```

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting `d.items()` with the custom key:
     ```
     [(0, 0), (6, 0), (1, 1), (4, 2), (3, 1), (5, 1)]
     ```

3. **Result Construction:**
   - Constructing the result string by appending characters from the original string at the sorted indices:
     - `ans = s[0] + s[6] + s[1] + s[4] + s[3] + s[5]`
     - `ans = "(()(()))" -> "()(()())"`

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
