Output State: **The program returns the count of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`, and `i` is set to -1.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `counter` variable holds the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`. The variable `i` is set to -1, indicating that the loop has completed all possible iterations.
