Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an input integer, `y3` is an input integer, `x4` is an input integer, `y4` is an input integer, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4` hold true, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4` or `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2` hold true; `x3` is now an input integer, `y3` is now an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x3` and `y3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
