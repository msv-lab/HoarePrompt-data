Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(97, k + 97)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `k`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(97, k + 97)`. This means `j` must be less than `k + 97`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 105
   - `k` must be at least 8
   - `s` is a string containing the character with ASCII value 105 (which is 'u')

4. **Calculate the new value of `j`**: Since `j` is incremented in each iteration, and it was 105 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 106 in the next iteration.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than `k + 97`. Given that `j` is now 106, `k` must be such that `106 < k + 97`. Simplifying this, we get `k > 9`.

6. **Adjust the states**: The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `k`. Therefore, we need to update these variables. `j` will be 106, and `k` must be greater than 9.

**Final State**:
State: **`j` is 106, `k` must be greater than 9, `s` is a string containing the character with ASCII value 105**
