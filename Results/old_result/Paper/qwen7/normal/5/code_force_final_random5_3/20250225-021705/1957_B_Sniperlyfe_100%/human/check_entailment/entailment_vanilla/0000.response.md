Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to generate an array `nums` of length `n` such that the sum of elements equals `k` and the bitwise OR of all elements is maximized.
   - The function initializes `nums` with zeros.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k`.
   - For each subsequent element, it tries to add the minimum possible value that keeps the sum equal to `k` and ensures the bitwise OR is maximized.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The main loop processes each test case, calls `func_1` to get the result, and formats it into a string.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Setting `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is a good start because it uses the maximum number of bits available in `k`. However, this might not always lead to the optimal solution for maximizing the bitwise OR.

2. **Subsequent Elements:**
   - The loop tries to fill the remaining positions with the smallest possible values that keep the sum correct. This approach might not always maximize the bitwise OR efficiently.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider the case where `k` is very small compared to `n`. The initial large value assigned to `nums[0]` might not allow the remaining elements to contribute effectively to the bitwise OR.
   - For example, if `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the function will set `nums[0]` to `1`, but the remaining elements will all be `0`, resulting in a bitwise OR of `1` instead of potentially achieving a higher value.

### Conclusion:

The given implementation does not guarantee the optimal solution for maximizing the bitwise OR. While it attempts to use the largest possible value for the first element, it does not ensure that the remaining elements are optimally chosen to maximize the bitwise OR.

Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
