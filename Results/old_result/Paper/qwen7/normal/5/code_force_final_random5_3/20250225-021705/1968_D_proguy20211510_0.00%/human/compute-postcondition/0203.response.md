Output State: **`founds` is `True`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing two elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `a[pb - 1] â‰  maxa`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pb` to be the value of `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
