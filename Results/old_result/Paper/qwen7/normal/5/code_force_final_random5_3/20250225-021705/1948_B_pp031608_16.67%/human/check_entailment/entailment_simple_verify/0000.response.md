### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Key Points to Evaluate:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. This part is correct.
2. **Main Loop Logic**: The main loop iterates through the list and attempts to perform the digit-splitting operation when the condition `list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10` is met. However, the implementation of the digit-splitting operation is flawed.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Digit-Splitting Operation**:
   - The current implementation of the digit-splitting operation is:
     ```python
     a = list1[p - 1]
     list1.pop(p - 1)
     list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
     list1.insert(p, a % 10)
     ```
   - This operation assumes that `a` is a two-digit number and splits it into its tens and units place. However, it does not handle the case where `a` might be a one-digit number or a number greater than 99. Additionally, it does not ensure that the new elements are inserted in the correct positions to maintain the order.

2. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Example 1**: Input: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
     - Expected Output: `YES`
     - Correct Splitting: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
     - Current Implementation: Does not perform the necessary splits, so it incorrectly outputs `NO`.

   - **Example 2**: Input: `[12, 28, 5]`
     - Expected Output: `NO`
     - Correct Splitting: Not possible to sort the array.
     - Current Implementation: Does not perform the necessary splits, so it incorrectly outputs `NO`.

   - **Example 3**: Input: `[0, 0]`
     - Expected Output: `YES`
     - Correct Splitting: Already sorted.
     - Current Implementation: Outputs `YES`, which is correct.

3. **General Case**:
   - The current implementation does not handle the general case where the array needs to be split multiple times to achieve a sorted order. It only performs a single split operation per iteration, which is insufficient.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The digit-splitting operation is flawed and does not handle all necessary cases. Therefore, the program cannot guarantee that it will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
