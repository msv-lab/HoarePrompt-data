Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the integers inputted by the user, `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`, `i` is `k + 1`, `k` is `k`, `n` is the initial input integer, `m` is the initial input integer, `k` is the initial input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, and `a` is the sum of `f` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the user input and assigns them to the respective variables. The values of `s`, `i`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
