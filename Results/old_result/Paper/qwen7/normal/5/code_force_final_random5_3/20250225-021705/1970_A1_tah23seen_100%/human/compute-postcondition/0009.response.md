Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is the length of `s`; `d[i + 1]` is `d[1]` and its value is `d[0] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d[i + 1]` to `d[i] - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `d[i + 1]` becomes `d[1]` and its value is set to `d[0] - 1`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and the character at index `i` of `s`) remain unchanged.
