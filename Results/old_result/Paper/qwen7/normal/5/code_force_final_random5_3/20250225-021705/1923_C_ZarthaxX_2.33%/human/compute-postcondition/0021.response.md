Output State: **Postcondition: `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `q` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`. We continue the loop or block of code.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since there is no further code to execute within the current loop or block, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The conditions and values of `l` and `r` staying equal to each other are preserved.
