Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not actually solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined but are not used to distribute the coins according to the problem statement. Instead, they seem to be related to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the greatest common divisor (GCD), which is not relevant to the problem of distributing coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the required bets for each outcome such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. The current implementation does not attempt to do this and thus fails to meet the problem's requirements.
