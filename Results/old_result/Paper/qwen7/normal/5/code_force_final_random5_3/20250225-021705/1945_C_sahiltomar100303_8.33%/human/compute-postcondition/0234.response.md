Output State: **`left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than `left // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 2) // 2`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

The code `leftOne -= 1` decreases the value of `leftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was originally less than `left // 2`, and now it has been decreased by 1, the new value of `leftOne` is still less than `left // 2`. The conditions for `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
