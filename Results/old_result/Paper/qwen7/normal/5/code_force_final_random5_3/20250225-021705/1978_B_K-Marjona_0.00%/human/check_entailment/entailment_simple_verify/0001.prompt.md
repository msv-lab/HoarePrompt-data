You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: All test cases have been processed, and the variable `t` is now 0. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are reset to their initial values for each test case, and `k` is recalculated based on the input for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins each, where `i` ranges from `1` to `k`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - We need to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`, which ensures that `k` is within the valid range.
   - It then checks if `b <= a`. If true, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so it prints `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula:
     - Sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series with the first term `b` and last term `(b - k + 1)`: `((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2) * k`
     - Plus the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`: `(n - k) * a`

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series is correct.
   - The condition `b <= a` correctly handles the case where the modified price is not beneficial.
   - The overall approach to finding the maximum profit is sound and matches the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when `b <= a`, where it simply prints `a * n`.
   - It also correctly handles the case when `k` is very large (up to `min(n, b - a)`).

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to maximize the profit based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
