Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers where all elements `b[i]` are 0 for all `i`**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `b` stays as a list of integers where all elements are 0.
