Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, results list contains 'no', `arr` is updated with the new string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `results.append('no')` appends the string `'no'` to the `results` list. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
