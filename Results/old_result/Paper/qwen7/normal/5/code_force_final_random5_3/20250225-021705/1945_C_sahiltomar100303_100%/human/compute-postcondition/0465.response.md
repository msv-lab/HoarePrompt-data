Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` is equal to `n`
- `left` remains 0
- `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`
- `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0
- `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`
- `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0
- The condition `left != 0` is false

The print statement is `print(right)`. Since `right` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`, the value of `right` will be `n`.

Output: **n**
