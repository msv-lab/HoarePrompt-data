Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or n//2, `rightOne` is either n//2 or n//2 + 1, `rightZero` is n - leftZero, `leftOne` is n - rightOne, `right` is mid + 1, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to (mid + 1) // 2, `trightOne` is less than or equal to (n - mid - 1) // 2, and `tleftOne` is either `tleftOne` or `tleftOne + 1`.

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the variables after executing the if-else block. Depending on whether `s[right]` is '0' or not, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` will adjust accordingly. If `s[right]` is '0', `trightZero` decreases by 1, leading to an increase in `tleftOne`. Otherwise, `tleftZero` increases by 1 without affecting `trightOne`.
