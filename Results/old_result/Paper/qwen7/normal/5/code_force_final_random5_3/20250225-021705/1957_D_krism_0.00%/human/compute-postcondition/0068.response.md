Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `n` to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order, decrementing `i` by 1 each time. Therefore, the loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 31
   - `j` is 31
   - For each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 30.
   - The value of `j` remains unchanged at 31 because the loop body does not modify `j`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - The state of `i` needs to be updated to 30.
   - The state of `j` remains 31.
   - The state of `suf[j][1]` and `suf[j][0]` for all `j` from 0 to 31 remains unchanged because the loop body does not modify these values outside the loop condition check.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 30, `j` is 31, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range.**
