Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop variables in the for loop are `i` and `c`.
   - `i` is the index of the current element in the sorted and unique elements of `b`.
   - `c` is the current element in the sorted and unique elements of `b`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are more unique elements in `b` to iterate over.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `b` is a list or iterable that must contain at least one unique element.
   - `char_map` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

4. **Analyze the loop head:**
   - The loop head is `for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop continues based on the sorted and unique elements of `b`, we need to ensure that `b` still contains at least one unique element.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - `c` will be the next unique element in the sorted order of `b`.

6. **Update the states accordingly:**
   - `b` must still contain at least one unique element.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `i + 1`.
   - `c` will be the next unique element in the sorted order of `b`.

Given this analysis, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`b` is a list or iterable that must contain at least one unique element; `char_map` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - (i + 1) - 1))`.**
