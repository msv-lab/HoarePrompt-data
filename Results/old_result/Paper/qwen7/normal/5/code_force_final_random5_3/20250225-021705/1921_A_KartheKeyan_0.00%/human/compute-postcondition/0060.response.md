Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `x` and `y` are input integers.
   - `coord` is a list of four tuples: 
     - First tuple: (1, `y`)
     - Second tuple: (`x`, `y`)
     - Third tuple: (`x`, `y`)
     - Fourth tuple: (`x`, `y`)

2. **Calculations:**
   - `p1` is the sum of squared differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the first two points in `coord`.
     - First point: (1, `y`)
     - Second point: (`x`, `y`)
     - Squared difference for x-coordinates: \((x - 1)^2\)
     - Squared difference for y-coordinates: \((y - y)^2 = 0\)
     - Therefore, `p1 = (x - 1)^2 + 0 = (x - 1)^2`
   - `p2` is the sum of squared differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the last two points in `coord`.
     - Third point: (`x`, `y`)
     - Fourth point: (`x`, `y`)
     - Squared difference for x-coordinates: \((x - x)^2 = 0\)
     - Squared difference for y-coordinates: \((y - y)^2 = 0\)
     - Therefore, `p2 = 0 + 0 = 0`

3. **Result Calculation:**
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
     - Since `p2 = 0`, the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2` is \( \sqrt{(x - 1)^2} \times \sqrt{0} = |x - 1| \times 0 = 0 \).
     - Therefore, `res = |0| = 0`.

Based on this, the `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
