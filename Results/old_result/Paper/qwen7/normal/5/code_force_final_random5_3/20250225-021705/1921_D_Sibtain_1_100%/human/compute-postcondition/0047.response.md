Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is equal to the length of list `a`, `len(a)` remains 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `i` and `j` are both equal to the length of list `a`, and `n` is decremented by 1.**

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
