Postcondition: `N` is a non-empty list, `cur` is the next element in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. If `num` (the next element in `N`) is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`.
