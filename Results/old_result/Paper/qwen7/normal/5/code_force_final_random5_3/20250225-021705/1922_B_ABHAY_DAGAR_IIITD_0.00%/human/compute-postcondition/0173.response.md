Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The function returns a result based on the input tuples, where each tuple's n and a_i values are processed according to their constraints.**

Note: The specific return value or result based on processing the tuples is not detailed here as per the given instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the internal operations.
