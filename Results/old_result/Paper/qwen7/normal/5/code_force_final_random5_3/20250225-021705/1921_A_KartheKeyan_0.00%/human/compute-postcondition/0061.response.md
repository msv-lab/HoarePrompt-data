Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, input integer), (input integer, input integer), (input integer, input integer), (input integer, input integer); `p1` is the sum of squared differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the first two points in `coord`; `p2` is the sum of squared differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the last two points in `coord`; `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.**

The value of `i` is decremented by 1, changing it from 3 to 2. The values of `x`, `y`, `coord`, `p1`, `p2`, and `res` remain unchanged as the code snippet only affects `i`.
