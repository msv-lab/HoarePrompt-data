You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `nums`.
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which will be used to track the year when the last sign occurred.

3. **Calculating the Year for the Next Sign:**
   - The program uses a loop to iterate through each periodicity `x` in `nums`.
   - Inside the loop, it updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

### Reasoning:

- **Formula Explanation:**
  - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is intended to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
  - However, this formula does not correctly handle the sequential waiting period as described in the problem statement.

- **Correct Approach:**
  - To correctly determine the year when the next sign will occur, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities up to the current point.
  - The LCM ensures that we account for the sequential waiting period for each sign.

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the example input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

- **Initial Year (`start_year`) is 0.**
- **First Sign (Periodicity 3):**
  - `start_year` becomes 3 (the smallest multiple of 3 that is >= 0).
- **Second Sign (Periodicity 2):**
  - `start_year` becomes 4 (the smallest multiple of 2 that is >= 3).
- **Third Sign (Periodicity 4):**
  - `start_year` becomes 8 (the smallest multiple of 4 that is >= 4).
- **Fourth Sign (Periodicity 5):**
  - `start_year` becomes 10 (the smallest multiple of 5 that is >= 8).
- **Fifth Sign (Periodicity 9):**
  - `start_year` becomes 18 (the smallest multiple of 9 that is >= 10).
- **Sixth Sign (Periodicity 18):**
  - `start_year` becomes 36 (the smallest multiple of 18 that is >= 18).

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year when the nth sign will occur. It uses a formula that does not account for the sequential waiting period properly.
