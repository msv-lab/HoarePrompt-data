Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(test_cases)`. The only variable involved here is `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. Since we don't know the exact value of `test_cases` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only ensure that it remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `test_cases` must still be greater than 0.

**State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
