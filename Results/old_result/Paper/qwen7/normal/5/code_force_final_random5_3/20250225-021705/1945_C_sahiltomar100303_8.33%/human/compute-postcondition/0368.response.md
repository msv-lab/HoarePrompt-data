Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` is the upper limit of the range, `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was previously increased by 1 if `s[i]` was '0', now it is simply incremented by 1 regardless of the condition. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
