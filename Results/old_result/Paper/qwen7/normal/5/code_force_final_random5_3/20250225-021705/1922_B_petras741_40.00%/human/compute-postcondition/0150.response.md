Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `eta` is a list containing the element `j`, where `j` is `n - 1`.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - Each element in the list `q` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding index in the list `w`.
   - If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains `j`. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.

4. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`, if the current value of `j` is `n - 1`, the next value of `j` will be `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be updated to `n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is used to determine the range of the loop but does not change within the loop itself.
   - The list `eta` will be checked again based on the new value of `j` (which is now `n`).

6. **Final state before the next iteration**:
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `n` is still greater than 0.
   - The list `eta` will be checked again based on the new value of `j`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`eta` is a list, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and each element in the list `q` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding index in the list `w`. If `q[n]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains `n`. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.**
