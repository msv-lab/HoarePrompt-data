### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to calculate the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal.
   - The result of `func_1(arr)` is printed for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - However, the logic inside the function is flawed:
     - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 and incremented as long as `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. This correctly identifies the rightmost segment starting from the beginning where all elements are the same.
     - The variable `j` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1` and decremented as long as `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`. This correctly identifies the leftmost segment ending from the end where all elements are the same.
     - The issue lies in the conditions used to determine the minimum cost:
       - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, the function returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the entire array can be made equal by changing the segment from `i` to `j - 1`. However, the correct approach should consider the cost of changing the entire array except the prefix of length `i` or the suffix of length `n - j`.
       - If `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, the function returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This is also incorrect because it does not properly account for the cost of changing the entire array except the prefix of length `i` or the suffix of length `n - j`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]` and we choose `i = 2` and `j = 4` with `x = 8`, the array becomes `[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1]`. The function would incorrectly return the cost of changing the entire array except the prefix or suffix, which is not the optimal solution.

5. **Output**:
   - The function outputs the incorrect minimum cost for some test cases. For example, for the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the correct minimum cost is 4, but the function would return a higher value.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. The function `func_1` contains logical errors in determining the minimum cost.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
