Reasoning:
- The annotated program does not match the actual code provided. Specifically, the function `func_1` is called without any parameters, but it should take the number of sticks `n` and their lengths as input.
- The program should read the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it should read the number of sticks `n` and their lengths, and then calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.
- The current implementation only reads the first test case and does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.
- The logic inside `func_1` is correct for calculating the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed, but it is not being called correctly.

Given these points, the program is not correct as it does not handle multiple test cases.

Correctness: **False**
