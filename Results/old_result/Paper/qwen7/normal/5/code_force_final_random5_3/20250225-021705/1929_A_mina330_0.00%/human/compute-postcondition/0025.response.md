Output State: **`ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is `ntest`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and its length must be at least 2, `kq` is `sum(a) - 2 * a[0] + a[len(a) - 1] - a[1]`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `kq` by adding `a[len(a) - i - 1]` (which is `a[-i]` or `a[len(a) - 1]` since `i` starts from 1) and subtracting `a[i]` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is 1 initially). After the first iteration, `i` is incremented to 2, and the new value of `kq` is calculated as `sum(a) - 2 * a[0] + a[len(a) - 1] - a[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
