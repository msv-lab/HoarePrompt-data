Output State: **`i` is 5, `m` is greater than 3, `end` is decreased by 1**

Explanation: The variable `end` is decremented by 1. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `m` is adjusted to reflect that it is now greater than 3 instead of greater than 4 due to the decrement of 1 in the code.
