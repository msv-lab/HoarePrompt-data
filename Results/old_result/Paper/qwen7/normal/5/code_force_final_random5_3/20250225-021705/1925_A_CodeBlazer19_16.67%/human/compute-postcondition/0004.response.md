Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `range(97, k + 97)`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as the value of `j` is within the range defined by `range(97, k + 97)`.
   - This means that the loop will start when `j` is 97 and continue until `j` reaches `k + 97`.

3. **Initial values**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is the first integer input by the user.
   - `k` is the second integer input by the user.
   - `s` is an empty string.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The loop will start when `j` is 97. Therefore, `j` must be initialized to 97 at the start of the loop.
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than or equal to 97 (since `j` starts from 97 and goes up to `k + 96`).

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of the variables involved in the loop head, which are `j` and the range definition involving `k`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is an empty string, `j` is 97, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 97**.
