Based on the initial state provided:

- The list `l` contains the maximum divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`.
- `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.

When the `print(ans)` statement is executed, it will print the maximum value found in the list `l`.

To break this down further:
1. `l` is a list of divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`.
2. `ans` is set to the maximum value in this list `l`.

Therefore, the output will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to k)**
