Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5⋅10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5⋅10^4 remains valid. The value of `s` is updated based on the new value of `n`, but the expression for `s` is kept as given. Variables `m` and `x` retain their original values since they are not affected by the operation.
