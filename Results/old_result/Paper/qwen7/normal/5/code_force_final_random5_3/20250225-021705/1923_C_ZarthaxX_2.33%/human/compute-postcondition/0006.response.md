Output State: **`ones[i]` is 1, `ones[i - 1]` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except for the first element which is 1, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `sum[2]` is `sum[1] + nums[1] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` list such that `sum[i]` is calculated as `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `sum[2]` is updated to `sum[1] + nums[1] - 1`. Since `sum[1]` is initially 0 (as per the initial state), the value of `sum[2]` becomes `0 + nums[1] - 1`, which simplifies to `nums[1] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
