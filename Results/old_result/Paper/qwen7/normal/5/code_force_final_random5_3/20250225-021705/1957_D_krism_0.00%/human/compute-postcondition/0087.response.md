Postcondition: **`i` is 30, `j` is 0, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31 plus 1 if the bit at position `j` is 1, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range.**
