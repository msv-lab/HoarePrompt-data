Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`d`).
   - It correctly handles moving up (`U`), down (`D`), left (`L`), and right (`R`).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function identifies and prints players who are eliminated due to a Bludger.
   - It iterates over the `player` dictionary to check if a player's position matches the Bludger's position.
   - If a match is found, the player is added to the `out` list and their position is set to `[-1, -1]` to mark them as eliminated.
   - The function then sorts the `out` list alphabetically and prints the elimination events.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The functions provided do not handle the entire game logic as described in the problem statement.
   - They do not process the game steps, update the state of the field, or handle scoring.
   - The functions do not interact with the game state in a way that would allow the program to simulate the game and produce the required output.

### Conclusion

Given that the provided functions only handle a small part of the game logic (elimination due to Bludgers) and do not cover the main aspects of the game (scoring, movement, catching, throwing, etc.), the program as a whole is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
