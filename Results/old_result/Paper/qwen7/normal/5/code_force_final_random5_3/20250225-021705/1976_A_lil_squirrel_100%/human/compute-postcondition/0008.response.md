Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing the character `ch`, `digits` is an empty list, and the character `ch` is not a digit.**

The code appends the character `ch` to the `letters` list. Since `ch` is not a digit, the state of `digits` remains unchanged as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
