You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the final input string after all iterations, `b` is the final input string after all iterations, `c` is the final input string after all iterations, `l` is 'YES'.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` and increments `i` each time). The variable `l` will be 'YES' if for every index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If there exists any index where both conditions are false (`a[i] == c[i]` and `b[i] == c[i]`), then `l` remains 'NO'. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold their respective final values after all iterations of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program checks if for each character position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this logic is insufficient because it does not account for the requirement that `a` and `b` must match the template while `c` does not.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- For the first character, `a[0] = 'a'`, `b[0] = 'b'`, and `c[0] = 'a'`. According to the program's logic, since `a[0]` is not equal to `c[0]` and `b[0]` is not equal to `c[0]`, it would incorrectly print "YES", but the correct output should be "NO" because `a` and `b` do not match the template if `c` does not.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
