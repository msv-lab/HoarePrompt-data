Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the same substring, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `leftMove = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftMove`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `mid`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, and `left` remain unchanged from their initial states.
