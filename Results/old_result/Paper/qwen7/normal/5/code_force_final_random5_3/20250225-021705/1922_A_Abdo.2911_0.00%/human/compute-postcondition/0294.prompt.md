Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is `True`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from `a`, where matching characters from `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and non-matching characters from `a` are converted to uppercase.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `template` is a list of characters, `i` is an index within the list, and `match_a_b` is a boolean. If the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter, and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If the character at index `i` in `template` is not a lowercase letter, and either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (when converted to lowercase) matches the lowercase version of `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` remains `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` matches `template[i]` when converted to lowercase, `match_a_b` and the break statement remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `match_a_b` is updated based on the following conditions: if `template[i].islower()` is true, then `match_a_b` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, if `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If neither condition is met, `match_a_b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `match_a_b` is either unchanged or becomes True. If `template[i].lower()` does not match either `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is continued. Otherwise, `match_a_b` becomes True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
