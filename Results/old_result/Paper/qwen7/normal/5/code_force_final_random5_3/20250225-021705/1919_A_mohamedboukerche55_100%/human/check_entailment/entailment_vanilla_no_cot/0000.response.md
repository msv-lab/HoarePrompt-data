Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the game rules. The logic in the `if` statement `(a + b) % 2 == 0` does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for the game. 

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key observation here is that the game is essentially a Nim game where the winning condition depends on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. 

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This solution correctly splits the input into `a` and `b`, then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd to determine the winner.
