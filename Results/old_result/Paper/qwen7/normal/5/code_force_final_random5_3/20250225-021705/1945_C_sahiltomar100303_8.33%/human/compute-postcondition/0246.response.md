Output State: **`left` is `left - 1`, `leftZero` is either (`leftZero` - 1) if `s[left]` is '0', or remains the same, `rightOne` is either increased by 1 if `s[left]` is '0', or increased by 1 if `s[left]` is not '0', `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left]` is '0', and `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left]` is not '0'.**

This means that the value of `left` has been decremented by 1. The conditions for updating `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, and `leftOne` remain the same, but they now apply to the new value of `left`. Specifically, if `s[left]` (the character at the new position of `left`) is '0', then `leftZero` decreases by 1, `rightZero` increases by 1, and `rightOne` increases by 1 if `s[left]` was originally '0'. If `s[left]` is not '0', then `leftOne` decreases by 1, and `rightOne` increases by 1.
