Functionality: **The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph starting from the current vertex (`curr`). It maintains a list (`path`) representing the current path of vertices being explored and uses a `colors` array to keep track of the visiting status of each vertex. The function returns one of the following:
1. The list `path` if the current vertex is already visited.
2. A set `res` containing the return value from the DFS function call if `node_v` is found in any path.
3. An empty list if no valid path is found after exploring all possibilities.**
