Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 2*n
   - `i` is 9
   - `m` must be greater than 3
   - `x` is `n - 6`
   - `y` is 81

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `m-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 9, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 10.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than 10 (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `m-1`).

Given these points, we can update the state as follows:

State: **`cnt` is 2*n, `i` is 10, `m` must be greater than 10, and `x` is `n - 6`; `y` is 81**
