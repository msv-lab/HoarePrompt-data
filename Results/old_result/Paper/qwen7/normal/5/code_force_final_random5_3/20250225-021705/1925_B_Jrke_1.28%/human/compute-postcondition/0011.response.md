Output State: **`x` is an integer, and there exists an integer `i` such that x is divisible by `i`; `l` is a list containing one element which is 'ans'.**

Explanation: The line `l = [ans]` creates a list `l` with a single element `'ans'`. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
