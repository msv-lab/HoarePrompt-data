Output State: **`pos` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `pos = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `pos` is now 0, while `n`, `i`, and the current value of `arr[i]` (which is `k`) remain as they were in the initial state.
