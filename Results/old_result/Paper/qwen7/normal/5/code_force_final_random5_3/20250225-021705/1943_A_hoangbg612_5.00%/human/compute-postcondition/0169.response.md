Postcondition: **`cur` is the maximum value in `N` that satisfies the condition `num > cur`, or the second-highest number plus one if the highest number does not satisfy the condition. `i` is 1 if the last element of `N` is greater than `cur`, otherwise it is 0. `S` is an input integer, and the sum of all values in `M` equals `S`. `M` is a dictionary where the key is each unique value in `N` that is greater than `cur` and the value is 1, and for all other keys in `N` that are less than or equal to `cur`, their values are incremented by the count of occurrences in `N`.**
