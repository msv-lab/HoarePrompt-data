Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input correctly, handling multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Extracting Test Case Details**: It extracts the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself for each test case.
3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - **Unique Characters Extraction**: The program correctly identifies all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - **Mapping Characters**: It creates a mapping where each character is replaced by its symmetric counterpart from the sorted list of unique characters.
   - **Decoding**: The program uses this mapping to decode the entire encoded string.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with repeated characters correctly.

Since the program correctly implements the decoding logic and handles all described scenarios without any issues, it meets the problem requirements for all potential cases.
