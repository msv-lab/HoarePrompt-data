Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `r` is the last element of `vals`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `prod` will hold the product of all the elements in the list `vals`. The variable `r` will be the last element of `vals` since it is reassigned in each iteration of the loop to the current element being processed. All other variables (`t` and `N`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
