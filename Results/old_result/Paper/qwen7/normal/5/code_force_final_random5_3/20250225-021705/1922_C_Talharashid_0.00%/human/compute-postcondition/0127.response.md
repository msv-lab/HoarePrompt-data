Output State: **`start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `i` is 0, `m` is the input integer `m`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. Since `s1` is just a temporary variable used in the calculation, the value of `s1` is stored in `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or updated states.
