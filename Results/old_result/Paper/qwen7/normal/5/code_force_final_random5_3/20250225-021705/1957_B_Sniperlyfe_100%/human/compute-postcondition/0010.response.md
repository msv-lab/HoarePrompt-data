Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `k` is decreased by `nums[1]`
   - `nums[1]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - **Variable `i`**: Since the loop starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - **Variable `n`**: The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than `1`. This condition remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust other variables**:
   - **Variable `k`**: The problem does not specify how `k` changes with each iteration, but it is mentioned that `k` is decreased by `nums[1]` and `nums[1]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. These values do not directly depend on the loop variable `i` or `n`, so they remain the same unless explicitly stated otherwise.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` is now `2`
   - `n` must still be greater than `1`
   - `k` and `nums[1]` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `nums[1]`, and `nums[1]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**
