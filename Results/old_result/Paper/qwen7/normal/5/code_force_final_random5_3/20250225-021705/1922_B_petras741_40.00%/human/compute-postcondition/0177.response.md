Output State: **`j` is greater than 1001, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001, `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho**.

Explanation: The initial state of `j` being greater than 1001 and `eta_ln` being greater than 1001 remains unchanged. The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its current value, which was previously increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`. Therefore, the new value of `res` is the sum of these two expressions.
