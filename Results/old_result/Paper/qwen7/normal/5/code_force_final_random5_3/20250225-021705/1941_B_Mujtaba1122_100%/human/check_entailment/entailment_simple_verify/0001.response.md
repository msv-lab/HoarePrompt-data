### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an element that is not zero.
- If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
- This function works correctly and serves its intended purpose.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
- It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
- For each index `i`, it checks if the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0` are met.
- If these conditions are met, it performs the operations:
  - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
  - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
  - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
- After performing the operations, it checks if `list[i-1]` is still not zero. If so, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
- If the loop completes without printing 'NO', it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Issues with the Given Program:

1. **Logic of Operations**:
   - The operations performed in `func_2` do not always lead to the desired result of making all elements zero.
   - Specifically, the operations only reduce the values of the array but do not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero under the given constraints.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. The operations might not be able to reduce all elements to zero due to the specific values and their relationships.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the initial array cannot be reduced to all zeros using the given operations.
   - For instance, if the sum of the elements in the array is odd, it is impossible to make all elements zero because each operation reduces the sum by an even number (2 from `a_i` and 1 from both `a_{i-1}` and `a_{i+1}`).

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed because it does not guarantee that all elements can be reduced to zero. The operations are not sufficient to handle all possible configurations of the array.
   - The program should check if the sum of the array is divisible by 3, as each operation reduces the sum by 3. If the sum is not divisible by 3, it is impossible to make all elements zero.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
