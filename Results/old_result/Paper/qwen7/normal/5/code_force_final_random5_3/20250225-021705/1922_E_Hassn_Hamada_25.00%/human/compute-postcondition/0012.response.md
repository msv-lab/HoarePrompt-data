Output State: `size` is 5 and `number` must be greater than or equal to 31.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `size` will be 5 because the loop increments `size` by 1 each time it runs, and it stops when `(1 << size + 1) - 1` exceeds `number`. Given that after 3 iterations `number` must be at least 15, the loop will continue until `(1 << 5 + 1) - 1 = 31` is no longer less than or equal to `number`. Thus, `size` becomes 5.
