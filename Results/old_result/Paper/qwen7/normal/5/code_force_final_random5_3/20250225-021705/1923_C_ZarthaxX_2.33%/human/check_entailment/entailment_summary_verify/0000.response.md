### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to validate the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- An array \(a\) of length \(m\) is considered good if there exists an integer array \(b\) of length \(m\) such that:
  1. \(\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum_{i=1}^{m} b_i\);
  2. \(a_i \neq b_i\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\);
  3. \(b_i > 0\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function processes a series of queries on a given array.
   - It calculates and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the sum of elements in a specified subarray meets a certain condition involving the count of 1s in that subarray.
   - Specifically, for each query defined by indices \( l \) and \( r \), it checks if \( 2 \times \text{count of 1s in } [l, r] + (r - l + 1) - \text{count of 1s in } [l, r] \leq \text{sum of elements in } [l, r] \).
   - If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.

2. **Global Variables**:
   - `ones`: Stores the cumulative count of 1s up to each index.
   - `sum`: Stores the cumulative sum of elements up to each index.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the count of 1s and the sum of elements in the specified subarray.
   - It then checks the condition \( 2 \times \text{count of 1s in } [l, r] + (r - l + 1) - \text{count of 1s in } [l, r] \leq \text{sum of elements in } [l, r] \).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes a series of queries on a given array.
- It calculates and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the sum of elements in a specified subarray meets a certain condition involving the count of 1s in that subarray.
- Specifically, for each query defined by indices \( l \) and \( r \), it checks if \( 2 \times \text{count of 1s in } [l, r] + (r - l + 1) - \text{count of 1s in } [l, r] \leq \text{sum of elements in } [l, r] \).
- If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The function summary correctly describes the logic implemented in the program.
- The condition \( 2 \times \text{count of 1s in } [l, r] + (r - l + 1) - \text{count of 1s in } [l, r] \leq \text{sum of elements in } [l, r] \) ensures that the subarray can be transformed into another array \(b\) where each element is different and positive.
- This condition is derived from the fact that if we replace all 1s with some other positive numbers, the sum of the new array must be equal to the sum of the original subarray, and the count of distinct elements must be at least the count of 1s plus the number of elements minus the count of 1s.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given problem description and function summary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the function summary.
