Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either lowercase or not lowercase; `match_a_b` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it does not change the values of `i`, `n`, or the character at index `i` in `template`. It also does not change the value of `match_a_b`. Therefore, the only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
