Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `a` is the sum of `f` for all iterations, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `i` is `m`, `k` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` will hold the sum of `f` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = m-1`. The other variables (`u`, `v`, `f`, `i`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `M`, `c`, and `s`) will retain their final values from the last iteration or their initial states as provided, except that `i` and `k` will both be equal to `m` since the loop has completed all its iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `i` must be less than `k`, `k` must be greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is now `2 * (s + c * i * c * m + c * a)`, `i` is less than `k`, `k` must be greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is now `2 * (s + c * i * c * m + c * a) + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `i` is less than `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
