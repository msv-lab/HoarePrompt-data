Output State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2; `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`; `b[3]` is `b[2] + x`; `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates `b[3]` to be equal to `b[2] + x`. From the initial state, we know that `b[2]` is already defined as `b[1] + x`. So, `b[3]` becomes `b[1] + x + x`, which simplifies to `b[1] + 2*x`. The values of `a[i]`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
