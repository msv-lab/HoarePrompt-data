Output State: **`char_map` remains unchanged, `s` is updated to `char_map[c]`, and `c` is now the second element of `b`; `s` is further updated to `s + char_map[c]`**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `s` is updated to `char_map[next_c]`, where `next_c` is the first element in `b`. After that, `c` is set to the next element in `b`, which is the second element.
- The code then updates `s` by adding `char_map[c]` to the current value of `s`.
- Therefore, `s` is now the concatenation of `char_map[next_c]` and `char_map[c]`, and `c` is the second element of `b`.
