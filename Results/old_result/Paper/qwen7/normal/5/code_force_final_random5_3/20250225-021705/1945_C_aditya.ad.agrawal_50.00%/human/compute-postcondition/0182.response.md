Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. For each test case, it returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. It processes these parameters and returns a result for each test case without accepting any parameters directly within its definition.
