Output State: **`size` is 9, `i` is 7, `number` must be at least 128, `value` is 254**

Explanation: The code calculates `value` using the expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given that `size` is 9 and `i` is 7, the expression evaluates to `(1 << 9) - (1 << 7)`, which is `512 - 128 = 254`. The values of `size`, `i`, and `number` remain unchanged from their initial states.
