Based on the initial state provided:

- `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0.
- `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `l` is an input integer.
- `r` is an input integer.
- The current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` without any reference to the variables `ones`, `sum`, `q`, `_`, `l`, or `r`.

Output: **NO**
