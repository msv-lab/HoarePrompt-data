To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculation process:

1. **Understanding `num_of_lens`**: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where keys are some identifiers (e.g., lengths), and values are counts of occurrences of those identifiers.

2. **Calculating `res`**:
   - For each key `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, `res` will be incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. This means we are calculating combinations of choosing 3 items out of `cnt` items.
   - For each `cnt` that is greater than or equal to 2, `res` will be further incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.

3. **`total_sum` Calculation**: `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for the current `cnt` being considered in the second part of the calculation.

Given this understanding, let's assume a concrete example to illustrate the calculation:

Suppose `num_of_lens = {1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 4}`.

- For `cnt = 4` (key 3):
  - `math.comb(4, 3) = 4`
  - `math.comb(4, 2) * total_sum = 6 * (2 + 3) = 6 * 5 = 30`
  - So, `res += 4 + 30 = 34`

Thus, after processing all values in `num_of_lens`, `res` would be the sum of these contributions.

Since the exact values of `num_of_lens` are not provided, we can only describe the general form of the result.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each cnt >= 3 and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each cnt >= 2, with total_sum being the sum of all values in num_of_lens.values() except cnt)**
