Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k >= 2:
        if n == k:
            print(*[k for j in range(k)])
        else:
            print('-1')
    else:
        print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer, `k` is the integer obtained from the same line after splitting and converting to integer, and if `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then either `k` equals `n` or `n` does not equal `k`; if `k` is less than 2, then `k` remains less than 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer, and `s` is the next line of input, with `n` and `k` now holding their respective integer values from the split input, regardless of whether `k` is greater than or equal to 2 or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer obtained from the second line of input split and converted to integer, `k` is an integer obtained from the second line of input split and converted to integer, `s` is the next line of input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
