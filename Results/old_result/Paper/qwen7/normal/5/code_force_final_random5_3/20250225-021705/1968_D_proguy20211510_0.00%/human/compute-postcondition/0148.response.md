Output State: **`i` is 3, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + preb[3] + (k - i - 1) * b[3]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`, and `ptss` now includes the value `pres[3] + rem * s[3]`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptss`. This new value is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, which translates to `pres[3] + (k - i - 1) * s[3]` given that `i` is 3 and `rem` is `k - i - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
