Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `a` and `b` (both between 1 and 10^9), and prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, otherwise it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
