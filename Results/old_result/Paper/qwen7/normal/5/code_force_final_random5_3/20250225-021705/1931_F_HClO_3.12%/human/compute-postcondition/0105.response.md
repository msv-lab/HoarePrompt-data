Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is an empty list, `m` is equal to 2, `a3` is the first integer input, and `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers input.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and splits them into a list. The first element of the list is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are assigned to `l3`. The conditions involving `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, and `m` remain unchanged.
