Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where destroying fewer than \(n-1\) bridges can still isolate some islands from island 1. Specifically, consider the case where \(n = 4\) and \(k = 1\). According to the problem description, even if \(k = 1\), Everule should still be able to visit all 4 islands because he can use alternative paths. However, the current implementation will incorrectly output 4, which is not the optimal solution.

A correct approach would involve determining the minimum number of islands that can be isolated by destroying at most \(k\) bridges. This requires a more complex algorithm, such as identifying the connected components after bridge destruction.
