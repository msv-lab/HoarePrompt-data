Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `nums` by converting the integer value of the element at index `i-1` in `arr` to a string, splitting it into individual digits (converted back to integers), and appending the integer value of the element at index `i` in `arr`. Since `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, the first element of `nums` will be the integer representation of the last digit of `arr[i-1]`, followed by the integer value of `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
