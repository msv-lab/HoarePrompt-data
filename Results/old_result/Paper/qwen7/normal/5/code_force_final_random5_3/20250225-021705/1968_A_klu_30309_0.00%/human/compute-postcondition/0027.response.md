Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `max_val` is set to the largest value of `y` (where `2 * y` is less than or equal to `x`) found during the loop's execution. If no such `y` exists, `max_val` remains 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `max_val` will hold the highest value of `y` that satisfies the condition `2 * y >= x` and divides `x` evenly. If no such `y` is found, `max_val` stays at its initial value of 1.
