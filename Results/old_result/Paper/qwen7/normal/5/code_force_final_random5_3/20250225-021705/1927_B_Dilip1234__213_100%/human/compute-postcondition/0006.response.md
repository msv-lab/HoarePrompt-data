Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 1; `n` is a positive integer; `s` is 'b'; `char_count[1]` is equal to 1.**

The code `char_count[j] += 1` increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, `char_count[1]` is incremented by 1. Since `char_count[j]` was initially equal to `a[i]` and `i` is 0, `char_count[1]` was initially 1 (assuming `a[0]` is 'a', which is represented by 1). After incrementing, `char_count[1]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
