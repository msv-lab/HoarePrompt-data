Given the initial state:
- `i` is 3
- `ind2` is 1

We need to evaluate the expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` and determine what will be printed.

However, there is a missing variable `ind1` in the expression. Since `ind1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise numerical answer. Instead, we will describe the expression in terms of the known variables.

The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` involves:
- `len(inpstr)`: This is the length of the string `inpstr`.
- `ind2`: This is given as 1.
- `ind1`: This is undefined.

Thus, the expression simplifies to `len(inpstr) - 1 - ind1`.

Output: **len(inpstr) - 1 - ind1 (where len(inpstr) is the length of the string inpstr and ind1 is undefined)**
