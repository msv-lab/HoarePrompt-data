Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `j` is 0
- `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined as follows:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.
2. **Variable `j`**: This variable is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
3. **Increment Operation**: `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 during each iteration.

### Current Iteration
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- Therefore, `q[w[0]]` was incremented by 1.

### Next Iteration
- For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it `j = 1`.

### Adjusted States
- **`j`**: It will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- **`q[w[j]]`**: Since `j` will be 1, `q[w[1]]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

### Final State
- `j` will be 1.
- `q[w[1]]` will be incremented by 1.

### Answer
State: **`j` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1**
