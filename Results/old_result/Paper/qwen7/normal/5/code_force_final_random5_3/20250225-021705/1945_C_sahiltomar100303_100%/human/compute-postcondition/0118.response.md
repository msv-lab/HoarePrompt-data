Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1 (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[right]` is '0' and 1 if `s[right]` is '1', `trightZero` is 0 less than its previous value, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` is increased by 1, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must hold true.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` becomes 2, `trightZero` decreases by 1, and `tleftOne` increases by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0'. If `s[right]` is not '0', `tleftZero` remains 1, `trightZero` decreases by 1, and `tleftOne` increases by 1. In both cases, `students`, `trightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, and `right` follow the specified rules, and the condition involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` must still hold.
