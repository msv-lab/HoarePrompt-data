Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [-1] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        p[i] = mex - a[i]
        mex = min(mex, p[i])
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `-1`; `mex` is the minimum value found during the loop execution among `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`; `p[i]` is updated for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` to be `mex - a[i]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have become `-1` (since the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to `0`), `mex` will hold the minimum value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop, and `p[i]` will contain the value `mex - a[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `p[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` will be equal to `mex - a[i]`. The variable `mex` will be the minimum value found among all `p[i]` after updating `p[i]` for every index `i`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `p` will contain the difference between `mex` and each element in `a`, and `mex` will be the smallest value in the updated `p` array.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`. For each `i` from `n-1` down to `0`, the variable `p[i]` will be set to `mex - a[i]`, and `mex` will be updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `p[i]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `p`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `i` will have decremented past `-1`, meaning the loop has processed every index from `n-1` down to `0`. The list `p` will contain values calculated based on `mex` and the corresponding elements of `a`, with `mex` being the smallest value found among these calculations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
