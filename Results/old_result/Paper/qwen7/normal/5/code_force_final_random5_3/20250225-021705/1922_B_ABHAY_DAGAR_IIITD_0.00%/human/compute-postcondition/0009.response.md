Output State: **`num_of_lens` is now {'x': 1}, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (must not be empty), `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first element of `num_list`, and `x` is not in `num_of_lens`**

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by setting the key `x` to the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
