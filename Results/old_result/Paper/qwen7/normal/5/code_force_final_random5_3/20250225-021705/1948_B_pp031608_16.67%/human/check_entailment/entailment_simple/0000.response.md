Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the digit splitting operation as described in the problem statement.
2. The `func_1` function checks if the list is sorted but does not perform any operations to sort the list through the allowed digit splitting operation.
3. The main loop iterates over the elements of the list and calls `func_1` without performing the necessary digit splitting operation. If `func_1` returns `False`, it attempts to split the element at index `p-1` into its constituent digits and reinsert them into the list. However, this approach is flawed because:
   - It only splits one element at a time and does not ensure that the list remains in a state where further splits could be beneficial.
   - It does not guarantee that the list will eventually be sorted after multiple operations.
4. The program does not handle cases where the initial list cannot be sorted using the allowed operations, such as when the list contains elements that are too large to be split and sorted.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
