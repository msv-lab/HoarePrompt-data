### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.
   - However, it is not used in the main logic of the program.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly handle the logic required.
   - Specifically, it calculates `x` and `y` based on the value of `i` and updates `cnt` accordingly.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - Instead, it uses a formula `2*n - 8` which is incorrect for most cases.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code provides some insight into the intended logic but still does not correctly reflect the solution.
- The function `func_2` is supposed to iterate through all possible values of `i` and update `cnt` based on the condition.
- However, the actual implementation does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

#### Test Case Verification:
- Let's verify the provided test cases:
  - For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
    - Expected output: 14
    - Actual output: 14 (This seems correct for this specific case)
  - For \(n = 3\) and \(m = 5\):
    - Expected output: 4
    - Actual output: 4 (This seems correct for this specific case)
  - For \(n = 100\) and \(m = 1233\):
    - Expected output: 153
    - Actual output: 153 (This seems correct for this specific case)

While these specific cases seem to work, the general logic of the function `func_2` does not correctly handle the condition for all possible pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. While it works for some specific cases, it does not handle the general logic required to solve the problem for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.
