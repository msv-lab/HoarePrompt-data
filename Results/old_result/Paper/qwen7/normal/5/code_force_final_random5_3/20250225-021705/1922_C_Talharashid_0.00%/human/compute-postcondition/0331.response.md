Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `s` is either 1 or the sum of `s` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, `start` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, and `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `mini`.**

Explanation: The code `d1[start] = s` updates the dictionary `d1` with the key `start` (which is 0) and assigns the value `s` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
