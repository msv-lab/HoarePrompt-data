Output State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` and `(row1, row2)` are assigned from `test_case`, `j` is less than `n`, and the current value of `row1[j]` is '>'**.

The code `reachable_second_row = True` sets the variable `reachable_second_row` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
