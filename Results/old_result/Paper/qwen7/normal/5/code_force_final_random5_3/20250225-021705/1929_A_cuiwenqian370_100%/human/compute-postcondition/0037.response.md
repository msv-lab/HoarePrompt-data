Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers. It calls `func_1(array)` for each test case to determine the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. After processing all test cases, it prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program is that all results are printed, and the `data` list is fully consumed.**
