Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is the fourth element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`, storing the result in `b_d`. Since `pos` is 1, `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2 - 1)`. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `z_r` or `o_r` (depending on the condition) remain unchanged from their initial states.
