Output State: **`max_val` is `y`, `x` must be greater than 1, and `x` is divisible by `y`. Additionally, `2 * y` is less than `x`.**

Explanation: The code sets `max_val` to the value of `y`. The other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `max_val` is now `y`, while the other conditions involving `x` and `y` still hold true.
