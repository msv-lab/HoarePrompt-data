### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the specified operations: subtracting `2 * list[i-1]` from `list[i]`, subtracting `list[i-1]` from `list[i+1]`, and subtracting `list[i-1]` from `list[i-1]`.
   - These operations continue until either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1 or `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` is no longer greater than 0.
   - After processing all indices, the array will be modified according to the given rules.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise it returns `False`.

3. **Overall Logic:**
   - `func_2` processes the array to try to make all elements zero using the specified operations.
   - If after processing, `func_1` returns `True`, it means all elements are zero, and the function prints "YES".
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it means there are non-zero elements left, and the function prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The logic in `func_2` ensures that the array can only be reduced to zeros if the initial conditions allow it.
   - The operations ensure that the sum of the array remains constant, and the only way to achieve all zeros is if the initial array can be reduced step-by-step according to the rules.

5. **Test Cases:**
   - The annotated program correctly handles the given test cases, printing "YES" or "NO" based on whether the array can be reduced to all zeros.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Rudolf can make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
