Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `val_a` and `sec_arr`.
2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sub_summ` is `0 + val_a[0]`, meaning `sub_summ` is the sum of the first element of `val_a` (which is a single-element list since it was the first element of `sec_arr`).
   - `sec_arr` is a non-empty list.
   - `val_a` is the first element in `sec_arr`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `sec_arr`. For the loop to continue, `sec_arr` must contain at least one more element.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `val_a` is now the second element of `sec_arr`, `val_a` should be set to the second element of `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` should be adjusted to remove the first element (the one that was just processed) or simply refer to the remaining elements in the list.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `sub_summ` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `sec_arr` should now be a list containing all elements except the first one.
- `val_a` should be the second element of the original `sec_arr`.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`sub_summ` is 0 + `val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `val_a` is the second element in the original `sec_arr`**. 

To be more precise, if we denote the original `sec_arr` as `[a, b, c, ...]`, then at the start of the next iteration:
- `val_a` would be `b`.
- `sec_arr` would be `[b, c, ...]`.

Therefore, the final state can be described as:

State: **`sub_summ` is 0 + `val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `val_a` is the second element in the original `sec_arr`**.
