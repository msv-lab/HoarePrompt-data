Output State: **`preb` has its last element updated to `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is now equal to `sb + b[i]`, `pres` has the new element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is now equal to `ss + s[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `preb` has a new element `sb + b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` increments the value of `sb` by `b[i]`. Since `sb` was previously equal to `sb + b[i]`, adding `b[i]` again updates `sb` to `sb + b[i]`. All other variables (`preb`, `pres`, `ss`, `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
