### Reasoning

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it is not used in the main function `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly implement the logic required. Let's break down the logic in `func_2`:
   ```python
   def func_2(n, m):
       cnt = 0
       for i in range(1, m):
           x = n - (i * i - i)
           y = i * i
           cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
       if cnt == 0:
           return 1
       return cnt
   ```

   - The loop iterates over values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then adds \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it checks if `cnt` is zero and returns 1 if so, otherwise returns `2*n - 8`.

This logic does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. The expressions `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not relate to the problem requirements.

#### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a more appropriate implementation:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

This function correctly counts the number of valid pairs by checking the condition for each pair \((a, b)\).

#### Evaluation
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func_2` does not handle the problem logic as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described.
