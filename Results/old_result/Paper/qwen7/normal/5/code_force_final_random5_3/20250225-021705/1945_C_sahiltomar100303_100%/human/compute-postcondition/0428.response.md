Output State: **`right` is `mid + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` must be less than \(\left\lceil \frac{mid + 2}{2} \right\rceil - 1\), `trightZero` is either decreased by 1 or remains the same, `trightOne` is now \(\frac{n - mid}{2}\), `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`, `s[mid + 1]` is not '0'**.

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `trightOne` is now \(\frac{n - mid}{2}\) because it was previously less than \(\frac{n - mid}{2} + 1\) and is now decremented by 1.
