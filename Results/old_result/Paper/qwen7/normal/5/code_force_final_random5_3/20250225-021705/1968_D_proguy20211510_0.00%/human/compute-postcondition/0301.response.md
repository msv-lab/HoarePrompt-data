Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(pres)`, `rem` is 0, `ptsb` contains the sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `len(pres)-1`, `ptss` contains the sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `len(pres)-1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. Additionally, `maxs` is greater than or equal to `maxb`.
