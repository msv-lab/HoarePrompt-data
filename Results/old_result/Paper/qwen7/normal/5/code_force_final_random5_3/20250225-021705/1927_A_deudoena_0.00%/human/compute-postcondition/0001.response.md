Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in `s` is 'B', `inpstr` is the input string from the user.**

The code initializes `ind1` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, or `inpstr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
