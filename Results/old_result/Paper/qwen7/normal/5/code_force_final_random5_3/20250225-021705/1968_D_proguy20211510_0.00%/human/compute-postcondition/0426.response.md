Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 3`, `sb` concatenated with `b[i]` is appended to `preb`.**

This means that the value of `i` remains `i_prev + 3`, and the value of `sb` concatenated with `b[i]` is appended to the list `preb`. The condition that `len(s)` must be greater than `i_prev + 3` is still valid.
