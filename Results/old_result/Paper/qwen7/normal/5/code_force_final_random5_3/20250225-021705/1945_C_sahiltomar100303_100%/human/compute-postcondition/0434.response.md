Output State: **`right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, `trightZero` is decreased by 1, and `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`**.

The code `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
