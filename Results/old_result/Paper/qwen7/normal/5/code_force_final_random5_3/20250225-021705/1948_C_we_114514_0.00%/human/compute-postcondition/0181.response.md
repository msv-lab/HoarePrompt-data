Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `row2[j]` is '>', `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `test_case` is updated to contain the next element in `test_cases`, `row1` is the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the updated second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code simply sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`, which does not affect any other variables. The values of `j`, `n`, `test_case`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged from their previous states.
