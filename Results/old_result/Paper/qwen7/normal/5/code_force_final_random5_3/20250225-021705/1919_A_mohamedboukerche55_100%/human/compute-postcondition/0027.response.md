Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is \(i + 2\), `s` is the input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the split string `s`. The postcondition does not change regardless of whether `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is true or false, as both the if and else parts do not modify these variables.**
