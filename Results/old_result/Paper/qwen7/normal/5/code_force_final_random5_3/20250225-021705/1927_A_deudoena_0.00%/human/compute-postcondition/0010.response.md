Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `enumerate` function, which provides two variables: `i` and `j`.

2. **Understand the conditions for loop continuation**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in `inpstr` to process. The variable `j` is the current character being processed.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is a string.
   - If `j` is equal to 'B', then `ind1` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop continues unless `j` is 'B', `j` must not be 'B' for the loop to continue.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `j` will be the next character in `inpstr`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `j` will be the next character in `inpstr`.
   - There is no mention of `ind1` changing unless `j` is 'B', but since we are assuming the loop continues, `ind1` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is the next character in `inpstr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ind1` is unchanged**. 

Since `ind1` is not explicitly mentioned to change unless `j` is 'B', and we are assuming the loop continues, we can leave it unchanged.

Final state:
State: **`j` is the next character in `inpstr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ind1` is unchanged**.
