Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the last digit of `arr[i-1]` and the element `arr[i]`**.

Explanation: The code converts the last digit of `arr[i-1]` into an integer and appends it to the list `nums`, followed by appending the element `arr[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
