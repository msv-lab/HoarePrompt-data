Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each character `ch` in the string `password`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `ch`, `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - `ch` will take on the value of each character in `password` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Initial state of `password`**: Since `password` is a string of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 20`), we need to ensure that `password` is initialized with a valid string of the appropriate length and characters.

4. **Initial state of `ch`**: Before the loop starts, `ch` is not yet defined because it will be assigned the value of each character in `password` during each iteration. However, we can set up the initial conditions such that the loop can proceed correctly.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that `password` is properly initialized as a string of the correct length and characters. The variable `ch` will be assigned the value of each character in `password` during each iteration, so no specific initial value is needed for `ch`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initialization of `password`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is an empty list**.
