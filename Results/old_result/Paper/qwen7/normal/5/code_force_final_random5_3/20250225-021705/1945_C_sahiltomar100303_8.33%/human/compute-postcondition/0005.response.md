Output State: **`leftZero` is 0, `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `leftZero` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states.
