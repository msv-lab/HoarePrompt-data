Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string.**

The code assigns an empty string to `first_row`, but does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
