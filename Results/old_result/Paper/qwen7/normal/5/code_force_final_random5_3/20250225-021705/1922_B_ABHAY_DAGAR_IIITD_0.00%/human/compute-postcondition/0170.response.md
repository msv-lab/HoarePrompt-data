Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list.
- `result` is the next element in the `results` list.

However, the initial state does not specify what the actual value of `result` is. Since no specific value or formula for `result` is given, we cannot determine its exact value.

Therefore, the output will simply be the value of `result`, which is the next element in the `results` list.

Output: **the next element in the `results` list**
