Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `start` is less than or equal to `end` and `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1 remains valid.
