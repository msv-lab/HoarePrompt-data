Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `c` is an integer from the input.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`.
- `d` is now set to `c / 2`.

The `print(a * b)` statement will print the product of `a` and `b`.

Since the values of `a` and `b` are explicitly stated to be integers from the input, we cannot determine their specific values without knowing the input. Therefore, the output will be the product of these two integers.

Output: **a * b (where a and b are integers from the input)**
