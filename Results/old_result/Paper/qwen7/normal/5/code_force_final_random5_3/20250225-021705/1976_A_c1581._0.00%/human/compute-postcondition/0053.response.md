The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`. `password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where 1 <= n <= 20, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. The function has multiple return points, all returning 'NO' except for one case which returns 'YES'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a password and return 'YES' under specific conditions, while returning 'NO' in all other cases.
