Postcondition: `edges` is a non-empty list, `_min_edge` is updated to either the minimum edge weight among all the edges connected to `node_u` (if the condition `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge` is true) or remains unchanged (if the condition is false). `node_u` is now `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`; `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`; `parent_u` is the root node of `node_u` in the DSU structure; `parent_v` is the root node of `node_v` in the DSU structure; the DSU structure has united `node_u` and `node_v` under the same root node.
