Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Since `i` is 1, the formula simplifies to `(last_year + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`. The values of `last_year` and `a[1]` are not specified, so they remain as part of the expression. The other variables (`i` and `n`) are not affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.
