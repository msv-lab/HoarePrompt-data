Output State: **`cur` is the current value of `cur` plus 1, `num` is greater than the updated value of `cur` plus 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `cur` variable has been incremented by 1, and the condition that `num` is greater than the updated value of `cur` plus 1 still holds. Additionally, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
