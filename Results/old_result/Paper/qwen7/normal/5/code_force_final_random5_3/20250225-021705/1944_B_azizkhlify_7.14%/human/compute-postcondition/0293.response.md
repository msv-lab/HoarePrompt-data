Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is a positive integer; `ul` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `ul` is incremented by 2, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is not given). Since no initial value for `ul` is provided, we assume it was 0 before the operation. After the operation, `ul` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
