You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, where the length of nums is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the sum of the elements in nums is divisible by n (1 <= n).
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n`, `curr` is the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean (`total // n`), and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.
    #
    #In more detail, `i` will be equal to the length of `nums` (denoted as `n`), because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `curr` accumulates the sum of `nums[i] - mean` for each iteration of the loop. If at any point during these iterations, `curr` becomes less than 0, the function would return 'NO' immediately. Since we are considering the state after all iterations, it means that `curr` never became negative, and thus the function would return 'YES' (implied by the absence of a return statement before the end of the loop).
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES', indicating that the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean (`total // n`) is always greater than or equal to 0 after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It returns 'NO' in all cases except when the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean (total // n) is always greater than or equal to 0 after all iterations, in which case it returns 'YES'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'NO'

Case_4: The program returns 'NO'

Case_5: The program returns 'YES', indicating that the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean (`total // n`) is always greater than or equal to 0 after all iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
