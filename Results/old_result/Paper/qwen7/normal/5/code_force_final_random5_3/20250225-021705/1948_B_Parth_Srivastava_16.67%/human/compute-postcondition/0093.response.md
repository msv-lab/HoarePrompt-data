Output State: **`a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is now 1, `c` contains the element `a[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to list `c`. Given that `i` is now 1, `c` will contain `a[1]`. The value of `a` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, and `i` is set to 1.
