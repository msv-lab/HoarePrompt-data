Output State: **`founds` and `foundb` remain `True`, `i` is `length_of_pres + 2`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 2`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing either three or four elements with the last element being `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is a list with the last element being `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` is the maximum value in `a` or `p[ps - 1]` otherwise, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.**

In this step, the value of `ps` is updated to be equal to `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
