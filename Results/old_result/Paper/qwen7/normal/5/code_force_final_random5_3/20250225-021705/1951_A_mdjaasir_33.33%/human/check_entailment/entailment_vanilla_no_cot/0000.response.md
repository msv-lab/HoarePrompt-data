Correctness: **False**

The provided program `func` does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python program that generates `.py` files (`ac_file` and `wa_file`) for each `.html` file found in specific subfolders of the current directory. However, the given program `func` is designed to read input from the user and print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the count of '1's in a string. Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the specified problem.
