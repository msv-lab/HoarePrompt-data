Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `s` is a non-empty list, `len(s)` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Since `sb` is 0, the value appended to `preb` is simply `b[i]`. The other variables (`pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `s`, and its length) remain unchanged.
