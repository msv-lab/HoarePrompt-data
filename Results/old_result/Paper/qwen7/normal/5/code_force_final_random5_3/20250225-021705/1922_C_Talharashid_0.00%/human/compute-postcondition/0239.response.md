Output State: **`inc` is -1, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is either 1 or the sum of `s` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial state, `d1` is a dictionary where keys are indices from `start` to `end` and values are cumulative sums of distances up to those indices, `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state except for the entry at index `start`, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.**

This means that the variable `mini` has been updated to the value `11111111`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
