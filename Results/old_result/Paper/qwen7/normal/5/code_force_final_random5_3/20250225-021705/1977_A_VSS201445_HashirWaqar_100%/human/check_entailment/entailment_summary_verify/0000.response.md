### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the tower.
   - The key observation is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the difference between `n` and `m`.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function reads multiple pairs of integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks if \( n \geq m \) and if \( (n - m) \) is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it checks if \( n \geq m \) and if \( (n - m) \) is even.
   - The logic is sound because:
     - If \( n \geq m \), it means we have enough moves to potentially achieve `m` cubes.
     - If \( (n - m) \) is even, it means the number of additions and removals can perfectly balance out to result in exactly `m` cubes.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly:
     - If \( n < m \), the condition \( n \geq m \) fails, and the program prints 'NO'.
     - If \( (n - m) \) is odd, the program prints 'NO' because an odd number of net changes cannot result in exactly `m` cubes.
     - If \( (n - m) \) is even, the program prints 'YES', which is correct.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
