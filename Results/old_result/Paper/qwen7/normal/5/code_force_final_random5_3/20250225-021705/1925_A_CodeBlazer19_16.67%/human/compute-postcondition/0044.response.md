Output State: **`j` is 200, `k` is at least 102, `s` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value 399 (`}*}*`).**

Explanation: The initial value of `s` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value 199, which is `}*`. The line `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` (which is 200) to `s`. The character corresponding to ASCII value 200 is `}*`, so `s` becomes `}*}*`. The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged.
