### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### 1. Reading Input
- The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
- This part is correct and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

#### 2. Extracting Test Case Details
- The program iterates over the test cases, extracting the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string (`b`) for each test case.
- This part is also correct.

#### 3. Decoding Logic
- **Unique Characters Extraction**:
  - The program correctly identifies all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
  - This is done using `set(encoded)` and `sorted()`.
  
- **Mapping Characters**:
  - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character is mapped to its symmetric counterpart from the sorted list of unique characters.
  - This is done using a loop that maps each character to its corresponding character from the end of the sorted list.
  - The loop runs from `0` to `len_unique - 1`, ensuring that each character is correctly mapped.
  
- **Decoding**:
  - The program uses the `char_map` dictionary to decode the entire encoded string by replacing each character with its mapped value.
  - This is done using `''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)`.

#### Edge Cases
- **Single Character Strings**: 
  - If the encoded string is a single character, the program correctly identifies it as the only unique character and maps it to itself.
- **Strings with Repeated Characters**: 
  - The program correctly handles repeated characters by maintaining the correct mapping for each unique character.
- **Empty Strings**: 
  - If the encoded string is empty, the program will handle it gracefully since `set(encoded)` will be empty, and the resulting `char_map` will be empty, leading to an empty decoded string.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding logic and handles all described scenarios without any issues. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
