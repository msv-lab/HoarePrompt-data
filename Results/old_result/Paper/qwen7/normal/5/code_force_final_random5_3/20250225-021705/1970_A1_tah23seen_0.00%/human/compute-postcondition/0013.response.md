Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {1: 2} if `s[1]` is "(", otherwise `{1: 0}`, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d` by setting `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1`. Initially, `d` has the key-value pair `{1: 1}` if `s[1]` is "(", otherwise `{1: -1}`. Since `i` is 2, `d[i + 1]` corresponds to `d[3]`. The value of `d[3]` is set to `d[2] + 1`. Given that `d[2]` is either `1` or `-1` depending on the value of `s[1]`, `d[3]` will be `2` if `s[1]` is "(", otherwise `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
