Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, `results` is a list of integers, `next_year` is undefined, `last_year` is updated to the value of `next_year`.**

Explanation: The line `last_year = next_year` updates the value of `last_year` to the value of `next_year`. Since `next_year` is defined as `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, `last_year` is now set to this expression. The other variables (`i`, `results`, and `next_year`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
