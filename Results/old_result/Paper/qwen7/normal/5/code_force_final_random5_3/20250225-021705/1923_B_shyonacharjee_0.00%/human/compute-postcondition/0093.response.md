Output State: **`i` is `t-1`; `distance` is `abs(position)'; `time_available` is `abs(position)'; `bullets_needed` is `health`; `position` and `health` are assigned the values from `monsters[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `bullets_needed = health` assigns the value of the variable `health` to `bullets_needed`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
