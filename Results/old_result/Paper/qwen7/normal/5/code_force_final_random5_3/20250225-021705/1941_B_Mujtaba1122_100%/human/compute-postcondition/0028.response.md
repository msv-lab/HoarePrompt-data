Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given as:
   ```
   while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
   ```

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `list[i]` is now `list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`
   - `list[i - 1]` is 0
   - `list[i + 1]` is now `list[i + 1] - 2 * list[i - 1]`

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition with Current States:**
   - Since `list[i - 1]` is 0, the condition `list[i - 1] > 0` is false.
   
4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, all parts of the condition must be true.
   - Specifically, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `list[i - 1]` to a value greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure `list[i - 1]` is greater than 0. Since `list[i - 1]` was set to 0 in the previous iteration, we need to increase its value to a positive number.

### Final Answer:
State: **`list[i]` is now `list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` is now `list[i + 1] - 2 * list[i - 1]`**
