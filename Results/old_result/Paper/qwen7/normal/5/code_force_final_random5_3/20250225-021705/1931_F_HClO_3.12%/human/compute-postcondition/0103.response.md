Postcondition: `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, the value of `val` is an empty list, and the condition `idx1 <= idx2` holds true. If `m` is equal to 2, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the value of `m`.
