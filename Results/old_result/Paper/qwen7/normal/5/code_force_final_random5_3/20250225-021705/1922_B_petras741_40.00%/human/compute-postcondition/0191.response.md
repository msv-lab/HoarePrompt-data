Postcondition: **`eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `j` is greater than `eta_ln`, `res` is increased by the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each iteration from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]` for each iteration from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the if-else block executes, `eta_ln` remains the length of `eta`, `j` is greater than `eta_ln`, `res` is incremented by a specific formula involving elements of `q` and `rho` for each element in `eta` from index 1 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `rho` is also incremented accordingly for each element in `eta` from index 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.
