Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for num in numbers[1:]`. The variables involved in this loop head are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `numbers[1:]`, meaning it iterates over all elements in `numbers` starting from the second element.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `result` is equal to `func_1(result, num)` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `numbers` must have at least two elements.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `numbers[1:]`, the next value of `num` will be the next element in `numbers` after the current one.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least three elements (since it starts from the second element).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `result` remains the same as it was updated in the previous iteration.
   - `num` will be the next element in `numbers`.
   - `numbers` must have at least three elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`result` is equal to `func_1(result, num)`, `numbers` must have at least three elements**
