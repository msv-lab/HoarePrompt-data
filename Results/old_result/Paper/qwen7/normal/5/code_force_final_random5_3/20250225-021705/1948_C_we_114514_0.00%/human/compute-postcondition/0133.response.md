Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is False**.

The variable `reachable_first_row` is explicitly set to `False` in the code. All other variables remain in their initial states: `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, and `row2[j]` remains '>' regardless of the condition `reachable_second_row`. The value of `j` is also unchanged and is still `previous_j + 1`.
