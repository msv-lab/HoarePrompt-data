Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(pres)`, `rem` is 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is not yet calculated, `ptss` is not yet calculated, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `p`. The other variables (`i`, `rem`, `pb`, `ps`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`) are not affected by this operation.
