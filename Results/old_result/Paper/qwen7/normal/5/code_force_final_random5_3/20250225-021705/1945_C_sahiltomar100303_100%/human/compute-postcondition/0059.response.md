Output State: The loop has executed from `i = mid` to `i = n - 1`. Therefore, `i` is now equal to `n - 1`. The variable `n` must be greater than `mid`. For every '0' encountered in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1, and for every '1' encountered, `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The final values of `trightZero` and `trightOne` will be the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's in the entire string `s` from the start up to the last index processed by the loop.

In summary, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, and `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the same substring.
