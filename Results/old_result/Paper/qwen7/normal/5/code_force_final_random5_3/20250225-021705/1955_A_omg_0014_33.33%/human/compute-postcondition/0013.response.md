Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is equal to `c / 2`, and `d` is now set to `c / 2`.**

The code `d = c / 2` updates the value of `d` to be half of `c`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
