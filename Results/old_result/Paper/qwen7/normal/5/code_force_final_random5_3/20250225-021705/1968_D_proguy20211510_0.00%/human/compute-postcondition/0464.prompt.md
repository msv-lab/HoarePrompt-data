Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers, p is a permutation of length n, a is an array of positive integers, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', MOD is 1000000007, YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO'
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxa = max(a)
    if a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Draw')
        continue
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        print('Bodya')
        continue
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Sasha')
        continue
    b, s = [], []
    founds, foundb = False, False
    for i in range(k):
        if foundb and founds:
            b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            break
        if foundb:
            b.append(maxa)
        elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
            foundb = True
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
        else:
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
            pb = p[pb - 1]
        if founds:
            s.append(maxa)
        elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
            founds = True
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
        else:
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
            ps = p[ps - 1]
    preb, pres = [], []
    sb, ss = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        preb.append(sb + b[i])
        sb += b[i]
        pres.append(ss + s[i])
        ss += s[i]
    ptsb, ptss = [], []
    for i in range(len(pres)):
        rem = k - (i + 1)
        ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
        ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])
    maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)
    if maxs > maxb:
        print('Sasha')
    elif maxs < maxb:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `ptsb` contains the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` contains the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + (k - i - 1) * s[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, and `maxs` is compared to `maxb` as follows: if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` remains the maximum value in `ptss`; if `maxs` is not greater than `maxb`, then `maxb` remains the maximum value in `ptsb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `len(pres)`, `rem` is 0, `ptsb` contains the sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `len(pres)-1`, `ptss` contains the sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `len(pres)-1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, `maxs` remains the maximum value in `ptss`. Otherwise, `maxs` equals `maxb` after the if-else block executes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `ptsb` is the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` is the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, and the maximum value between `maxs` and `maxb` is determined by the if-else condition: if `maxs > maxb`, then `maxs` is the maximum value; otherwise, `maxb` is the maximum value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
