Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `n` is the first integer from the input split by space.
- `k` is the second integer from the input split by space.

The `print(n)` statement will print the value of `n`, which is the first integer from the input split by space.

Output: **n (where n is the first integer from the input split by space)**
