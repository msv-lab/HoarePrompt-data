Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` and `c` are lists of integers with the same length
   - The first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `c`
   - The first element of `b` is not equal to the first element of `c`
   - `l` is 'YES'

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`. This means the loop has completed all its iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `0` (the start of the next iteration).

5. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` should be `0`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `a` and `c` must still be lists of integers with the same length.
   - The first element of `a` must still be not equal to the first element of `c`.
   - The first element of `b` must still be not equal to the first element of `c`.
   - `l` must remain 'YES' because the loop has completed all iterations without breaking and the condition `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` held true for all elements.

6. **Adjusting States**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`. It should be reset to `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `c` are lists of integers with the same length, the first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `c`, the first element of `b` is not equal to the first element of `c`, and `l` is 'YES'**.
