Output State: The final state of the `values` list will contain 200,000 elements, where each element `values[i]` (for `i` ranging from 0 to 199,999) holds the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i+1`. In other words, `values[i]` will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i+1` for every `i` in the range from 0 to 199,999.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `values` list will be fully populated with the required cumulative sums, starting from `values[0]` which would be the digit sum of 1, and ending with `values[199999]` which would be the sum of the digit sums from 1 to 200,000.
