Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `mid - 1`, and both `leftZero` and `leftOne` will be equal to `2 * mid`.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `mid - 1`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements up to the midpoint of the string `s`. The counters `leftZero` and `leftOne` will each hold a value of `2 * mid`, which means that during the entire execution of the loop, the total number of zeros and ones encountered in the first half of the string `s` (up to index `mid - 1`) is counted twice due to the loop iterating from `0` to `mid - 1`.
