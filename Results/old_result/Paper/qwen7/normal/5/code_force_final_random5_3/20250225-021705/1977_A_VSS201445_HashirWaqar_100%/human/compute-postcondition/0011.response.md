Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is the integer entered by the user.
- `m` is the second integer entered by the user.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` do not affect this output because the print statement does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **YES**
