### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` is defined to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s` in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. This function is crucial for solving the problem.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0. This is correct.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments the count of '1's (`one`). This is correct.
     - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the cost. This logic is based on the observation that each '0' that appears after the first '1' will require a separate cyclic shift operation to move it to its correct position. However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts.

4. **Optimal Cyclic Shifts**:
   - The current logic assumes that each '0' after the first '1' requires a separate cyclic shift, but this is not necessarily true. For example, consider the string "101011". The optimal solution would be to perform the following cyclic shifts:
     - Choose the substring "10" and shift it to get "011011" (cost = 2).
     - Choose the substring "011" and shift it to get "110110" (cost = 3).
     - Choose the substring "110" and shift it to get "110110" (cost = 3).
     - Total cost = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
   - The current logic would incorrectly calculate the cost as 9, which is higher than the optimal cost.

5. **Output**: The function returns the calculated cost, which is printed for each test case. However, since the logic for calculating the cost is incorrect, the output will not be accurate.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The current logic assumes each '0' after the first '1' requires a separate cyclic shift, which is not always the case. The correct approach would involve finding the longest prefix of '1's and then performing shifts optimally to minimize the total cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
