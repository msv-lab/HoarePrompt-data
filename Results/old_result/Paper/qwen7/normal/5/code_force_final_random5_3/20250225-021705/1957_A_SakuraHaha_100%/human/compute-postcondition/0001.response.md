Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the result of `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the user is expected to input a series of space-separated integers, which are then converted to a list of integers. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
