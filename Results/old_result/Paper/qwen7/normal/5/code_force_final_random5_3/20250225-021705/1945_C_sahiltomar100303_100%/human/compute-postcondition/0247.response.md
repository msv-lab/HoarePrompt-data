Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n-4`, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is initially `n-4`, `total` is 0, and the conditions for `leftZero` and `rightOne` must be maintained, `rightOne` now satisfies the condition of being less than `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
