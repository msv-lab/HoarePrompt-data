Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is `end - 3`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 3`. If `start < end` is true, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. If `start < end` is false, then `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations (assuming `m` is at least 4), the variable `i` will be 3, indicating 3 iterations have been completed. The `end` index will have been decremented by 3, and `start` will also have been decremented by 3. The variable `s` remains 0 as it is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The conditions for `s1` and `s2` depend on the comparison between `start` and `end` within the loop, but since `s` is always reset to 0, these values will reflect the latest computation based on the current `start` and `end` indices after the final iteration.
