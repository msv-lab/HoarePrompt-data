Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by splitting the input string using spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
