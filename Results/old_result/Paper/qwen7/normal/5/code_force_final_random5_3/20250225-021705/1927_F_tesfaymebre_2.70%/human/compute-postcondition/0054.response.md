Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is the root node of `node_u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `node_v` in the DSU structure.**

Explanation: The code `parent_u = dsu.find(u)` finds the root node of `node_u` in the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure and assigns it to `parent_u`. The values of `node_v`, `parent_v`, and the list `edges` remain unchanged.
