Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` is the upper limit of the range, `rightZero` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is updated to be increased by 1, making it equal to `rightZero + 1`. Since `rightZero` was previously increased by 1, it is now increased by 2. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
