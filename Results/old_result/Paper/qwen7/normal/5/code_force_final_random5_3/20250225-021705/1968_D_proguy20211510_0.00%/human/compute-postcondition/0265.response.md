Output State: **`preb` has had its last element updated to `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is now equal to `sb + b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` increments the value of `sb` by `b[i]`. The variable `preb` retains its last updated state, which means its last element is still `sb + b[i]`. The value of `sb` is now updated to `sb + b[i]`.
