Output State: **`res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`**.

This means that the value of `res` has been updated by adding the combination of `cnt` choose 3 (calculated using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`). The dictionary `num_of_lens` and the variable `cnt` have been updated to point to the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.
