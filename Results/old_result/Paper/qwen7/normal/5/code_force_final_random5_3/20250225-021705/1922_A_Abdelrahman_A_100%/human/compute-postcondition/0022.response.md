Output State: **`counter` is increased by 1, `c` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter than before, `x` is the next character in `c`, `no` is False**

The code `no = False` does not change the value of `counter`, `c`, or `x`. It only updates the value of `no` to `False`, which was already `False` in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
