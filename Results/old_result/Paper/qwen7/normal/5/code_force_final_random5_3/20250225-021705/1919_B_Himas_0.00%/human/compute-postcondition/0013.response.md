Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e`, `P` is 2, `M` is 1**

Explanation: Initially, `P` is 1 if `q` equals '+', otherwise `M` is 1. After executing `P += 1`, the value of `P` is incremented by 1. Since `P` was initially 1 or 0 (depending on the condition), it now becomes 2. The value of `M` remains unchanged as the code only modifies `P`. The strings `e` and `q` remain unaffected by this operation.
