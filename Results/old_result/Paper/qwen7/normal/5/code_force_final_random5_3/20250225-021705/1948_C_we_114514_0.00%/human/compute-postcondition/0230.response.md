Output State: **`results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether `reachable_second_row` was True at the end of processing each `test_case` in `test_cases`.**

This means that after executing the code, the `results` list will contain 'YES' for each `test_case` where `reachable_second_row` became True at the end of its processing, and 'NO' for all other cases. The `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` variables are reset to False at the start of each new `test_case`, and `j` is set to `n` at the end of each iteration through `test_cases`. The final `results` list reflects the outcome of each `test_case` based on the condition of `reachable_second_row`.
