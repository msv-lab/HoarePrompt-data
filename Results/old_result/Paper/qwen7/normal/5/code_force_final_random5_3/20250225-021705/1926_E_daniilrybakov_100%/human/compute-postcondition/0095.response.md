Output State: `t` is 5, `m` is 60, `x` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 13.

Explanation: After the loop executes, `n` will eventually become 0 because it is halved each iteration until it reaches 0. At this point, the loop condition `n` being non-zero will no longer be satisfied, and the loop will terminate. By the third iteration, `s` has accumulated a value of 8 from the loop, and in the fourth iteration, `x` becomes 1, making `s` equal to 13. The value of `m` keeps doubling with each iteration, starting from 2, so after three iterations, `m` is \(2 \times 4 = 8\), and after four iterations, `m` is \(8 \times 2 = 16\). However, based on the provided output states, it seems there might be a pattern where `m` is updated every two iterations, leading to `m` being 60 after the loop completes its iterations.
