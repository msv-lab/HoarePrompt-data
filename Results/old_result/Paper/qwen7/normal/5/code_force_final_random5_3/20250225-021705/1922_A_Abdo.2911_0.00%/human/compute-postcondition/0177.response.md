Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `match_a_b` or `i`, but it indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
