Output State: **`preb` is a list containing one element which is `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `s` must be a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given that `sb` is initially 0, the first element appended to `preb` is `0 + b[i]`, which simplifies to `b[i]`. The other variables (`pres`, `sb`, `ss`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
