Based on the initial state described:

- After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` is `-1`.
- `mex` is the minimum value found during the loop execution among `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
- `p[i]` is updated for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` to be `mex - a[i]`.

The `print(*p)` statement will print the contents of the list `p` with each element separated by a space.

To determine the exact values in `p`, let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization**: Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to `n-1` and then decremented until it reaches `-1`.
2. **Loop Execution**: During each iteration, `mex` is updated to be the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
3. **Updating `p`**: For each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact values of `mex` and `p`. However, we know that `p` will contain the values `mex - a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers, each representing `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]] (where mex is the minimum value found during the loop execution among mex - a[i] for all i in the range [0, n-1])**
