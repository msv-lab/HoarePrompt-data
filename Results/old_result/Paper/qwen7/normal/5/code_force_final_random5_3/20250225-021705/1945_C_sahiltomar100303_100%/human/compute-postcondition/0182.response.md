Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value, `trightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is either 1 or 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is either 1 or 3, `right` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `mid` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the input string, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is either 1 or 2, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, and `s[i]` is either '0' or not '0'**.

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is incremented by 1. Since `leftOne` was either 0 or 2 initially, after incrementing by 1, it becomes either 1 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
