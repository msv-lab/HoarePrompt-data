Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `preb` includes the appended value `sb + b[i + 1]` and now equals `sb + b[i + 1]`, `pres` includes the appended value `ss + s[i]` and now equals `ss + s[i]`**.

This means that the variable `i` has been incremented by 1, `preb` has been updated to include the value `sb + b[i + 1]`, and `pres` has been updated to include the value `ss + s[i]`.
