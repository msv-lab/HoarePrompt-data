Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the Current State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1.
   - `x` is `1` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is `2`.
   - `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is defined outside the loop.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `a[i]` will now be `a[2]`.
   - `x` will be determined based on the value of `a[2]`.
   - `b[2]` will be `b[1] + x`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `i` should be `2`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a[2]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1.
- `x` is `1` if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is `2`.
- `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1, `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**.
