Output State: **`left` is greater than 0 and equal to `left - 1`, and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'**.

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially greater than 0 and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0', after decrementing `leftOne` by 1, `leftOne` (renamed as `left` in the output state) will still be greater than 0 and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` remains unchanged and is still not '0'.
