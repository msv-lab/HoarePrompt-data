Output State: **`c` remains unchanged, `d` is the sorted version of `c`, `n` is the length of `c`, and `b` contains the element 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `b`. The lists `c` and `d` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The variable `n` represents the length of `c`, which also remains unchanged since no elements are added or removed from `c`. After executing the code, `b` now contains the element `1`.
