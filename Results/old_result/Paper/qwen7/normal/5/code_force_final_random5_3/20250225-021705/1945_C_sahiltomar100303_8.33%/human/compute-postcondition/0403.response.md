Output State: **`left` is at least 1, `leftZero` is either `leftZero - 1` or remains the same, `rightOne` is either `rightOne + 2` or remains the same, `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` could either be `rightOne + 1` or remain the same before the increment, after the increment, it will either be `rightOne + 2` or remain the same. The other variables (`left`, `leftZero`, and `leftOne`) are not affected by this operation.
