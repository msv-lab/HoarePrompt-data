Output State: **`i` is 4; `last_year` is equal to (next_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]; `next_year` is the same as `last_year`**

Explanation: The code `last_year = next_year` assigns the value of `next_year` to `last_year`. Therefore, `last_year` now holds the value of `next_year`, and `next_year` remains unchanged. The value of `i` stays the same as it was not affected by the code. The expression for `last_year` is updated to reflect its new value being equal to `next_year`.
