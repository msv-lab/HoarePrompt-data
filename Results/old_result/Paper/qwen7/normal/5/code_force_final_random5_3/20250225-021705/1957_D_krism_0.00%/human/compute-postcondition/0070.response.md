Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `j` as the variable being iterated over using `range(32)`. This means `j` will take values from 0 to 31.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The initial state given is `j` is 31. Since the loop starts with `j = 31` and iterates down to `j = 0`, we need to ensure that `j` starts at 31 and decreases correctly.

3. **Check the Loop Condition**: The loop condition `for j in range(32)` ensures that `j` will iterate from 0 to 31 inclusive. Given that `j` starts at 31, the loop will execute for all values of `j` from 31 down to 0.

4. **Adjust the State of `j`**: To ensure the loop starts correctly, `j` should be set to 31 at the beginning of the loop.

5. **Verify Other Variables**: The other variables (`i`, `cur`, `suf`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they should remain consistent with their given states.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is `j` to be 31.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 31, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range, `j` must be 31**
