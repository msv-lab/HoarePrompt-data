Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `cnt` is a list containing the next key `k` appended, `cur` is the last integer processed in the list `N`, and `N` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.**

In this case, the code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. Since `k` is the next key, it gets added to the existing list in `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
