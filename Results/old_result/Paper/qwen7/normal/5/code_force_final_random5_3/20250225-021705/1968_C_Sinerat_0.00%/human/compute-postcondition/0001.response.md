Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which in this case means they are not defined yet. The only variable affected is `n`, which now holds the integer value of the user's input.
