Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, and the mean is `total // n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the mean of the list `nums` by performing integer division of `total` by `n`. Since `total` is divisible by `n`, the result of `total // n` will be an integer representing the mean of the elements in `nums`. The values of `n` and `total` remain unchanged.
