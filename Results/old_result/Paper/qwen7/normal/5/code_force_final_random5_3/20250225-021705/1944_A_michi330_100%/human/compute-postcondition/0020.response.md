Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. The values of `n` and `k` are determined by the last iteration of the loop, where `n` is the first integer from the last input split by space, and `k` is the second integer from the last input split by space. No changes are made to `t` throughout the loop executions.
