### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's reiterate why the provided program is incorrect based on the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Problem Description Recap:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Summaries Recap:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Correctly computes the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2(n, m)`: Implements a logic that does not match the problem requirements. It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\) and uses expressions that are unrelated to the problem constraints. Specifically, it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\), which do not contribute to counting valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

3. **Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The loop in `func_2` iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\), which is not aligned with the problem constraints.
   - The expression \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) are not relevant to the problem.
   - The increment operations `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` do not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Since `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.
