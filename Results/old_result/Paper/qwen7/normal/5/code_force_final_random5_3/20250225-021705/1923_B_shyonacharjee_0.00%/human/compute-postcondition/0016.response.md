Postcondition: `i` is 0, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is its original value, `health` is its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, and `success` is False. This is because either the condition `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` is true, leading to `success` being set to False and breaking out of the loop, or the condition is false, in which case no changes occur to the variables.
