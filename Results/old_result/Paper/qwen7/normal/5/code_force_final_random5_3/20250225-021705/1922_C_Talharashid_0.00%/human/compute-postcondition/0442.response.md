Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(m)`. This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = m-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 5
   - `m` is greater than 3
   - `end` is decreased by 1 (implying `end` was originally 6, now it is 5)
   - `s` is 0
   - Additional postconditions related to `start`, `d2`, and `d1` are not directly relevant to adjusting the loop variables.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 5, the loop will not execute again because `range(m)` will stop at `m-1`. Therefore, `i` will not change.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

Since `i` is 5 and the loop will not execute again because `i` is already equal to `m`, `m` does not need to be adjusted further.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 5, `m` is greater than 3**
