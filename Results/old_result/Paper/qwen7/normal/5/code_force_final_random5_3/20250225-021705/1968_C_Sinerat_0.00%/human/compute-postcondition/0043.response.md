Output State: The list `a` will contain `n` elements where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the initial value 500 and the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`. The variable `i` will have the final value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. Specifically, `a[0]` will be 500, `a[1]` will be `500 + x[0]`, `a[2]` will be `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, and so on until `a[n-1]`, which will be `500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `a` will have `n` elements, starting with 500, and each subsequent element will be the sum of 500 and all the preceding elements in the list `x`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, showing that the loop has run through all inputs.
