Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`, and `res` is the original value of `res` plus the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`**.

Explanation:
- The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` that are not equal to `cnt`. This means if `num_of_lens` contains keys and their corresponding values, `total_sum` will exclude the values that match `cnt`.
- The value of `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to its original value. Since `math.comb(cnt, 3)` is calculated unconditionally, this addition is performed regardless of the condition in the given postcondition.
