Output State: **number is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and for each test case, sequence is a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}); a function is defined to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input number, but no sequence is generated yet.**

The code defines a function without executing it, so the function itself is now part of the state, but no sequence has been generated yet. The variables `number` and `sequence` retain their initial values and conditions.
