Output State: **`index` is 10 + `n`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the value of `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[9 + `n` + `n` : 9 + 2*`n`], `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_1(arr)` to the variable `result`. The function `func_1` is called with the list `arr` as its argument. The values of `index`, `t`, `results`, and `arr` remain unchanged except that `result` now holds the return value of `func_1(arr)`.
