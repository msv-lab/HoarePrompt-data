Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `l` will have each index `a[i] - 1` incremented by the number of times that index appears in the range `n`. All other variables (`res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`) will remain unchanged from their initial state.

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `l` will contain counts of how many times each value (from the array `a`) appeared as an index in the range specified by `n`. The variables `res`, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` will still be at their initial values since they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be such that `i` is less than `2 * n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
