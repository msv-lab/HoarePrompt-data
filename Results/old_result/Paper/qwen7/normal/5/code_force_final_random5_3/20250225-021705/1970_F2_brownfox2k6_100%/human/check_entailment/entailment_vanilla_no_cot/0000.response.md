Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code snippet only includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but the problem requires a complete program to handle the entire game logic, including processing actions, updating the state of the game, and determining the outcome of the game. The functions provided do not cover the full requirements of the problem statement.

Here's a brief overview of what the program should include but is missing from the provided code:

1. **Initialization**: Reading the initial state of the field, players, goals, and the Quaffle.
2. **Action Processing**: Handling each action (moving, catching, throwing) for each entity.
3. **State Update**: Updating the positions and states of players, balls, and bludgers after each action.
4. **Scoring Logic**: Checking if a player has scored a goal and updating the score accordingly.
5. **Elimination Logic**: Checking if a player is eliminated due to a collision with a bludger.
6. **Output Events**: Printing the events as specified in the problem statement.
7. **Final Score**: Printing the final score at the end of the game.

The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are incomplete and do not address the core logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program as given is incorrect.
