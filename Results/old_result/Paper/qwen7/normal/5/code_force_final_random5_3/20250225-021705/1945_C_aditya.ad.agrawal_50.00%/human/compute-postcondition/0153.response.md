Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arr`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is the second element of `arr`.
   - `pos` is 1.
   - `o_l` is 1.
   - `i` is not equal to 0.
   - `ans` is 1.
   - `b_d` is 0.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in the array `arr`. Since `i` was the second element, the next element would be the third element.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`. The other variables (`pos`, `o_l`, `ans`, `b_d`) are not directly controlled by the loop itself but might change based on the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine their exact values after the next iteration without additional information.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect that `i` is now the third element of `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is the third element of `arr`**.

Note: The values of `pos`, `o_l`, `ans`, and `b_d` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not provided here.
