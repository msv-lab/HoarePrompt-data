Output State: **`list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0; `list[i + 1]` is decreased by `list[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`. Since `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` is decreased by this positive value. The precondition that `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0 is still valid, but now it is effectively `list[i + 1] - list[i - 1] > 0`. However, since we are only asked to provide the updated state and not the new condition, we state that `list[i + 1]` is decreased by `list[i - 1]`.
