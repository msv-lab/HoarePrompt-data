Output State: **`n` is an integer value of the original `n` string, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `pb` is an integer value of the original `pb` string, `ps` is an integer value of the original `ps` string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `a`. However, the original variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged. The list `p` is updated to be the list of integers obtained from the input.
