Output State: `size_overlap` is (2, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 2, `size` is `i + 3`, `value` is \(2^{i+3} - 2^i\).

After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `size` will be `i + 3`, where `i` is at least 2. The `value` will be calculated as \(2^{i+3} - 2^i\). The `size_overlap` remains (2, 1) as it does not change within the loop. The `sequence` must remain non-negative, and `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue executing.
