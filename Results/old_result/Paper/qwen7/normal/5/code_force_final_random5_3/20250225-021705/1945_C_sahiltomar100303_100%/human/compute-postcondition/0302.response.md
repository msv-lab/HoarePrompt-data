Postcondition: **`right` is the maximum index such that the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` still holds, `tleftZero` is the total count of '0's from index `0` to `right-1`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's from `right` to the final value of `left`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's from `right` to the final value of `left`, `tleftOne` is the total count of '1's from index `0` to `right-1`, `left` is the last index where the condition was met, `leftMove` is the number of times `left` was incremented, and `s` remains unchanged. Additionally, `right` is equal to `n`, `left` is 0, and the condition `tleftZero < (n + 1) // 2` does not hold**.
