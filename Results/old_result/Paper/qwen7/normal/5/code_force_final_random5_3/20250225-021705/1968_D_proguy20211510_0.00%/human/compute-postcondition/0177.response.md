Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `len(pres)`: This means `i` is the length of the list `pres`.
- `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`: This means `rem` is the result of subtracting the length of `pres` from `k` and then subtracting 1.
- `n` is an integer: This is just a general integer and its value is not specified.
- `k` is an integer: Another general integer and its value is not specified.
- `pb` is an integer: Another general integer and its value is not specified.
- `ps` is an integer: Another general integer and its value is not specified.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from input: This list is derived from user input but its specific values are not provided.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`: This list is also derived from user input but its specific values are not provided.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`: This is the highest integer value found in the list `a`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
