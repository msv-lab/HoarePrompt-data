Output State: **`j` is 3, `q[w[j-1]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. At the start of the loop iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, `w[j]` refers to `w[2]`, and `q[w[j]]` is updated to `q[w[2]] + 1`. After executing this line, `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition for the loop continues as long as `j < n`.
