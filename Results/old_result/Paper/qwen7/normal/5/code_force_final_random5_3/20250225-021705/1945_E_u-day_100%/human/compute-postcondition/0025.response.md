Output State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is added to set `st`, `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`**.

Explanation: The code `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
