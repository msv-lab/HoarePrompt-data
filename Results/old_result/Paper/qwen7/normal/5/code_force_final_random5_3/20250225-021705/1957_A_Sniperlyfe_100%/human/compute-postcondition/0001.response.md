Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `n` and the object `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: In the given code, `n` is iterating over the elements of `arr`. This means that `n` will take on the values of the elements in `arr` one by one.

3. **Initial state of `arr`**: The problem states that `arr` is a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100.

4. **Initial state of `freq`**: The problem states that `freq` is an empty dictionary. This means that at the start of the loop, `freq` has no key-value pairs.

5. **Loop execution condition**: For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. Since `arr` is a list of integers, it will always contain at least one element if it is not empty.

6. **Adjusting the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty. If `arr` were empty, the loop would not execute at all. Additionally, since `n` will take on the values from `arr`, we need to ensure that `n` is initialized to the first element of `arr` for the first iteration.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `arr` should not be empty.
- `n` should be set to the first element of `arr`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment is:

**State: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the first element of `arr`**
