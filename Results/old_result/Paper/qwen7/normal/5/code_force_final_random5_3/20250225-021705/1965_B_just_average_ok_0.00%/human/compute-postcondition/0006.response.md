Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.
2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input.
   - `k` is the second integer input split from the same line of input.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `k >= 1 << idx`.
   - Given `idx` is currently 1, the condition becomes `k >= 1 << 1`, which simplifies to `k >= 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still satisfy the condition `k >= 2`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that `k` is still greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23**
