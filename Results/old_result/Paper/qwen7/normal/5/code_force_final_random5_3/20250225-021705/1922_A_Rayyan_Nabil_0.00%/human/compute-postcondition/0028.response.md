Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` is already 0, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'YES'**
