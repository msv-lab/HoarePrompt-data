Output State: **After all iterations, `curr` will be the sum of all non-zero elements in the final `nums` list minus the last element of the final `nums` list. If `curr` equals 0, it remains 0. Otherwise, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the final `nums` list minus the last element of the final `nums` list.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `curr` will hold the value calculated by summing up all the non-zero elements in the `nums` list (as the last element is subtracted from the cumulative sum of the non-zero elements), and if this sum is zero, `curr` will remain zero.
