Postcondition: `inc` is -1, `start` is now equal to `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `s` is either 1 or the sum of `s` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial state, `d1` is a dictionary where keys are indices from `start` to `end` and values are cumulative sums of distances up to those indices, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.
