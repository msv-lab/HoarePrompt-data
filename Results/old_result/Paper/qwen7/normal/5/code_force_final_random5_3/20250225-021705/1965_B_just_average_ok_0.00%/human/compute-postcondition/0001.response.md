Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` is the second integer input split from the same line of input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
