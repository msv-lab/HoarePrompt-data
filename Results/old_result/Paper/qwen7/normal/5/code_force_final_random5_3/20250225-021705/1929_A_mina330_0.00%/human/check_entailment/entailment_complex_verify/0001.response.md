### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we need to strategically place the largest and smallest elements to ensure the differences are maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by pairing the smallest half of the sorted array with the largest half and summing the differences.
   - Specifically, for each pair \((a[i], a[len(a) - i - 1])\), it computes \(a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]\).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements.
   - By subtracting the smaller element from the larger one, we ensure that the differences are maximized.
   - However, the current implementation only considers the middle elements for pairing. This might not always yield the maximum beauty, especially for arrays with specific patterns or small sizes.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints.
   - It correctly processes the input and outputs the maximum beauty as required.

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected behavior of the solution.
   - For instance, in the first example, sorting \([2, 1, 3]\) gives \([1, 2, 3]\), and the beauty is calculated as \((3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 2\).
   - However, consider the array \([1, 2, 3, 4]\). Sorting it gives \([1, 2, 3, 4]\). The current solution would calculate the beauty as \((4 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 6\). But the optimal arrangement would be \([1, 4, 2, 3]\), which gives \((4 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 6\). In this case, the solution is correct, but it fails to consider other potential optimal arrangements.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - While the solution works for many cases, it does not guarantee the maximum beauty for all possible input arrays. The current approach only considers the middle elements for pairing and may miss other optimal arrangements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is not guaranteed to find the maximum beauty for all possible input arrays due to the limitations in how it pairs elements. A more comprehensive approach, such as considering all possible pairings or using a different strategy, would be necessary to ensure the maximum beauty is always achieved.
