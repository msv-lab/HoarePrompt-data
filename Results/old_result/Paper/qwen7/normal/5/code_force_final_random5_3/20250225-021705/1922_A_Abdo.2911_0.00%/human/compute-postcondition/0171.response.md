Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `match_a_b` is True
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now `i + 1`)
   - `n` must be greater than 0

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - Inside the loop, there is a check to see if `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`.
   - If either condition is met, the loop breaks.
   - If neither condition is met, `match_a_b` becomes False.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as long as it is greater than 0.
   - `match_a_b` could be either True or False depending on the conditions inside the loop, but since we are looking at the state before the loop starts, we assume it could be either.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `match_a_b` could be True or False, but we don't know its exact value until the loop body is executed.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
