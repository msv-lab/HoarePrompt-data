Output State: **`leftZero` is 0, `left` is 0, `leftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `right` is equal to `n` or less than `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The line `leftZero = 0` sets the variable `leftZero` to 0. All other variables retain their previous values as no changes were made to them in the given code snippet.
