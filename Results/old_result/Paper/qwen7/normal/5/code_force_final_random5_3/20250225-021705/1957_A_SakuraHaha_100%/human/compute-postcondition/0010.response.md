Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key's value is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the key in the original list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all iterations, the list `a` will be empty because one element is processed in each iteration. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the count of each unique integer present in the original list `a`. For every key \(x\) in `cnt`, its value will be the total number of occurrences of \(x\) in the list `a`.
