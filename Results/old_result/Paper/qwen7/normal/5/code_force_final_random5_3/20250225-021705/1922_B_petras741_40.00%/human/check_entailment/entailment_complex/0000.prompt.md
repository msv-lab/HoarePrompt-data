Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.

    #State: All iterations of the loop have been executed. The variable `i` will have a value of `t-1` since it increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop. For each `i` from 0 to `t-1`, the following conditions hold: `n` is an integer input by the user, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is a list of unique integers from `w` that have a count greater than 0 in `q`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` in `eta`, and `res` accumulates the contributions from each iteration of the loop as described. If `n` is less than 3, `res` is simply 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of sub-cases, followed by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, it calculates a specific combinatorial result based on the frequency of unique integers in the list `a`. If `n` is less than 3, it returns 0. The function prints the calculated result for each valid sub-case and does not return any value explicitly.
