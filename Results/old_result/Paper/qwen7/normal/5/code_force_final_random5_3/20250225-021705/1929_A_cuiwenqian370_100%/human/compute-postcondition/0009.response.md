Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by `n`, `array` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`.**

Explanation: The code `index += n` increases the value of `index` by `n`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `array` is updated to start from `index - n` because the original definition of `array` was from `index` with length `n`, now `index` has been incremented by `n`, so the new starting point for `array` is `index - n`.
