Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is an input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string `s`.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `s` into a list of substrings using the space character as the delimiter. It then converts the second element of this list (which is the second integer from the original string `s`) to an integer and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
