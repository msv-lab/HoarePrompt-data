Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(t > 2\), `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` depend on the input provided by the user, but they are specifically assigned those values. The condition for `t` remains the same.
