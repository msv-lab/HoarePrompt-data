Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - **func_2()**: Reads the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - **func_3()**: Reads the permutation `p` for each test case.
   - **func_4()**: Returns input from the user, which is not used in the provided code.
   - **func_5()**: Returns a list of strings containing the values of `t`, `n`, and `x` for each test case, which is also not used in the provided code.

2. **Main Code Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program involves finding the correct position for `x` in the permutation using binary search.
   - It uses a binary search-like approach to find the correct position for `x` by adjusting the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If `x` is not found directly, it performs swaps to ensure `x` is in the correct position.

3. **Binary Search Adjustments**:
   - The program ensures that `x` is placed in the correct position by making at most two swaps.
   - If `x` is not found initially, it identifies the correct position and makes necessary adjustments.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the number of swaps needed and the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - The logic correctly handles the conditions for performing 0, 1, or 2 swaps.

Given the provided code, the logic for rearranging the permutation to place `x` at the correct position using at most two swaps is correct. The binary search-like approach and the subsequent swaps are implemented accurately.

Correctness: **True**
