Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < a`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers from the input.
   - `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4` hold true, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4` or `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2` hold true.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, after the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `a` remains unchanged because it is a loop control variable and not modified within the loop body (based on the given information).

5. **Post-iteration state**:
   - `a` must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` will be 1.
   - The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` remain the same.
   - The value of `res` remains the same as it is determined based on the conditions outside the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input, `y4` is the second integer from the input, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4` hold true, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4` or `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2` hold true.**
