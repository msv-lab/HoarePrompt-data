Output State: `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `j` is equal to `n`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `j` will be `n` because the loop increments `j` in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. Since the loop does not change the value of `reachable_first_row` once it becomes `False`, and `reachable_second_row` remains `True` as long as there is a '>' in `row2`, the final state of the variables will be `reachable_second_row` being `True`, `reachable_first_row` being `False`, and `j` being `n`. The value of `results` remains unchanged from its initial state.
