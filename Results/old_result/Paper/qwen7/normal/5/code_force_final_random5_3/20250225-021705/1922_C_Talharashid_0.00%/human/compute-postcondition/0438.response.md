Output State: **`i` is 5, `m` is greater than 3, `end` is decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is abs(`d2[end]` - `d2[start]`), `s2` is abs(`d1[start]` - `d1[end]`).**

The code calculates the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` and assigns it to `s2`. Since `start` and `end` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, they remain as they are, and the value of `s1` remains unchanged. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `end`, `s`, `s1`) retain their previous values or conditions.
