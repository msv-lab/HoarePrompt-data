Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` containing only zeros; `k` is decreased by `(1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1`.**

Explanation: The initial value of `nums[0]` is `(1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1`. This value is subtracted from `k`. After the operation, `k` is updated to `k - ((1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
