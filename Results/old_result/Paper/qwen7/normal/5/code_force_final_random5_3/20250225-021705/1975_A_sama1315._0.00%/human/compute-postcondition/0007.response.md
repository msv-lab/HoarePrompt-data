Output State: **`index` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n` after converting it to an integer using `int()`. Given that `index` was initially 2, `n` now holds the integer value of `data[2]`. The other variables (`t` and `results`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
