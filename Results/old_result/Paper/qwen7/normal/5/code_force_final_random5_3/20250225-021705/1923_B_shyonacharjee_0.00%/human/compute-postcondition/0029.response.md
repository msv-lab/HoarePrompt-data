Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`.
   - Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
     - `i` is 1
     - `bullets_needed` is `health`
     - `position` is updated to `monsters[1][0]`
     - `health` is updated to `monsters[1][1]`
     - `distance` is the absolute value of `position`
     - `time_available` is equal to `distance`
     - `total_bullets_used` is `2 * health`
     - `success` is False

3. **Update the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such specification is given, `n` stays as it was before the loop started.

4. **Construct the New State:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will be 2.
   - All other states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is updated to `monsters[1][0]`, `health` is updated to `monsters[1][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `2 * health`, and `success` is False**
