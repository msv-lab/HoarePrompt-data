Output State: **`num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `no = []` creates an empty list named `no`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `num`, `prev_iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable`, `iterable2`, `less`, and `big` remain unchanged.
