Output State: **`pos` is 2, `i` will be the fifth element of `arr`, `b_d` remains the absolute value of `n / 2 - 1`, `o_r` and `o_l` are each decreased by 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `z_r` is decreased by 1, `z_r` and `z_l` remain unchanged, `ans` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos`, which is 2, to `ans`. All other variables (`i`, `b_d`, `o_r`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `z_l`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
