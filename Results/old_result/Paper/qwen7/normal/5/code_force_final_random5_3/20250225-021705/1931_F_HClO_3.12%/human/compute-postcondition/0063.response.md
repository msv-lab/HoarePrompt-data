Output State: **`p1` is 1, `p2` is either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` is `i`; `idx2` is either `i+1` and `-1`, `-1` and `i+1`, or `i+1` and `i+1`; `n` is greater than 1; if `i + max(1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l1[i + 1 + 1]` is not equal to `l2[i + 1 + p2]`.**

Explanation: The value of `p1` is explicitly set to 1. The values of `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `n`, and the condition involving `i`, `max(p1, p2)`, and the comparison with `n - 1` remain unchanged. Additionally, the condition involving `l1` and `l2` also remains unchanged, but now `p1` is 1 instead of its original value.
