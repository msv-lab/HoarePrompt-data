Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `y`. The loop runs from `x - 1` down to `2` (since the step is `-1`).

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is greater than 1.
   - `y` remains unchanged.
   - `max_val` is set to `y`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `y` must be greater than 1 and less than `x`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `y` remains unchanged, its value from the previous iteration should be used.
   - `x` must still be greater than `y` (since `y` is being decremented).
   - `max_val` should remain the same as it was set in the previous iteration.

5. **Calculate the new state**:
   - Let's assume `y` was `x - 1` at the end of the previous iteration (since it starts from `x - 1` and decrements).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be `x - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is greater than 2, `y` is `x - 2`, and `max_val` is set to `x - 2`**.
