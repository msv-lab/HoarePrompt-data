Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list, `cur` is the value of `num`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. Otherwise, `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` simply assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The initial conditions regarding the list `N` and the behavior of the loop or if statement remain unchanged.
