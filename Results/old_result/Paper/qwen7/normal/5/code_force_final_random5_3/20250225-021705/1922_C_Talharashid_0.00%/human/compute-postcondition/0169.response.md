Postcondition: **`mini` is 11111111, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is the input integer `m`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers input by the user. The current value of `start` is less than the length of `lst`.**
