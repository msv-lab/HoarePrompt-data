State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, as is the case with `range(n)` which starts counting from 0.
4. The value of `t` is not directly related to the loop's execution condition and remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
