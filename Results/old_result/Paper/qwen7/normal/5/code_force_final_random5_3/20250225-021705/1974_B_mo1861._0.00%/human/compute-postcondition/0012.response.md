Output State: **`char_map` is unchanged, `s` is now equal to `char_map[c]`, `c` is the first element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `s += char_map[c]` appends the value of `char_map[c]` to the string `s`. Here, `c` is the first element of the non-empty iterable `b`. Since `s` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `s` will contain the value of `char_map[c]`. The `char_map` remains unchanged, and `c` retains its value as the first element of `b`.
