Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4**.

This means that `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, and since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 5 ⋅ 10^4, this constraint is preserved. The other variables (`n` and `k`) are not yet defined and remain unaffected by this line of code.
