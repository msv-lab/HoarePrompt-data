Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `right` is no longer `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `rightZero`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
