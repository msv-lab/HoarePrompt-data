Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `template` now contains the element `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `template.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `template`. Since `i` was previously less than `n` and is now incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The template now includes the element `a[i]` at the current index `i`.
