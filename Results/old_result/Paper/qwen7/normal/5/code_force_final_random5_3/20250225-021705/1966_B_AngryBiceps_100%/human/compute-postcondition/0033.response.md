Output State: **`last_row` is an empty string, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list containing one element which is an input integer, `first_row` is an empty string, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the value of `input()` to the list `a`. Since `input()` returns a string, `a` becomes a list containing one element, which is the input string. All other variables remain unchanged.
