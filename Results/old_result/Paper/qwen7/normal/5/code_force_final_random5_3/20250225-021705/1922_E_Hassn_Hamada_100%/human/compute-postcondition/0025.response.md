Output State: **`size` is 4, `size_overlap` remains (2, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 1, `number` must be at least 14**

The code increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` was 3, so after executing `size += 1`, `size` becomes 4. The other variables (`size_overlap`, `sequence`, `i`, and `number`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
