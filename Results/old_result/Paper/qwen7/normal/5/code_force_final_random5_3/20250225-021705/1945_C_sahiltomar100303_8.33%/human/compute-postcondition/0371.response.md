Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` is the upper limit of the range, `rightOne` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` was already increased by 1 in the initial state. The code snippet `trightOne += 1` increments `rightOne` by 1 again, making it increased by 2 in total. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
