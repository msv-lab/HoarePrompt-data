Output State: **`h1` is '07', `m1` is equal to the string `m` from the user's input split by `:`, `time` is 'PM'**.

The code assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. Since `h1` and `m1` were not affected by this assignment, their values remain unchanged. The variable `time` now holds the value `'PM'`.
