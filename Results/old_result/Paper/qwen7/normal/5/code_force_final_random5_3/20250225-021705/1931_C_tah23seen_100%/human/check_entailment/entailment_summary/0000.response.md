Reasoning:
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` is supposed to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the cost of the operation. It only checks if the first and last elements are the same and calculates a potential cost based on that, but it does not consider the actual values of the elements or the cost of changing segments of the array.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of an operation is determined by the length of the segment being changed, which is `(j - i + 1)`. The program should find the minimum cost by considering all possible segments where the array can be made uniform with one operation.

3. **Test Case Handling**: The main part of the program correctly reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, the logic inside `func_1` needs to be revised to correctly compute the minimum cost.

Given these points, the current implementation does not solve the problem as intended. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
