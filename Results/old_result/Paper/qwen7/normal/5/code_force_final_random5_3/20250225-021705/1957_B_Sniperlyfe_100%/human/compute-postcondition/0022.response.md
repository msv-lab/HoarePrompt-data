Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` where `nums[0]` is equal to its original value plus `k`, and every element from `nums[1]` to `nums[n-1]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` was greater than 0 during the iterations. Additionally, `i` is equal to `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 0.**
