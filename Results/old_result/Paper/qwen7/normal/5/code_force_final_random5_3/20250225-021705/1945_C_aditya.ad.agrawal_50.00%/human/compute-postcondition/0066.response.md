Output State: **`input_string` is a string read from input, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code counts the number of 0s in the list `arr`. Since `arr` contains integers which are ASCII values of characters from `input_string`, the count of 0s in `arr` would be the count of characters in `input_string` that have an ASCII value of 0 (which corresponds to the null character). However, since the presence of the null character in a string read from input is highly unlikely unless explicitly inserted, `z` is effectively the count of such occurrences. The values of `input_string` and `arr` remain unchanged, and a new variable `z` is introduced with its value being the count of 0s in `arr`.
