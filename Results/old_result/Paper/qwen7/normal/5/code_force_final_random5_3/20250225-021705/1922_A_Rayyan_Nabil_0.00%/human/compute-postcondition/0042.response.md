Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is a new input string.
- `c` is the input from the user.
- `l` is initially set to 'NO'.

The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. During each iteration, the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is checked. If this condition is true for any index `i` within the range, `l` is set to 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.

Given that the loop has completed all its iterations and no index `i` from `0` to `n-1` satisfied the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]`, the variable `l` remains 'NO'.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `l`, which is 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
