Output State: **`inc` is -1, `start` is now equal to `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is 0, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial state, `d1` is a dictionary where keys are indices from `start` to `end` and values are cumulative sums of distances up to those indices, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state.**

Explanation: The code sets `mini` to a very large number, 11111111. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
