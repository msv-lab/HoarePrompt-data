Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) and a binary string \( a \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the number of zeros and ones in the first half and second half of the string. It then performs two pointer operations to find the optimal position to balance the number of zeros and ones around the center of the string. Finally, it outputs the index of the optimal position based on the balance criteria.**
