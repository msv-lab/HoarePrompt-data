Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `mid + 3`.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since the initial value of `right` was `mid + 2`, after executing this line, the new value of `right` becomes `mid + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
