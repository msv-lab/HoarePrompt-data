Output State: `i` is 4, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers converted from space-separated integers input by the user, `j` is 1.

Explanation: After the loop executes 3 times, `i` becomes 3. The loop condition `i <= n - 1` will check if `i` is still less than or equal to `n - 1`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4 (as given in the precondition), `i` will increment to 4 in the next iteration. However, since the loop condition is now `i == 4` and `4 <= n - 1` would depend on the value of `n`, if `n` is 4 or more, the loop will continue to increment `i` until it no longer satisfies the condition. Given the information provided, we can conclude that after all iterations, `i` will be 4, and the loop will have broken due to the conditions inside the loop body being met, setting `j` to 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
