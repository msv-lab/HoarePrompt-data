Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in nums`. The variables involved here are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on each element of the list `nums` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `nums`: This is the list over which the loop iterates.

3. **Understand the initial values given**:
   - `t` is equal to its initial value minus 1 (though this is not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `n` is an input integer (though this is not directly relevant to the loop either).
   - `last` is the last element of the list `nums`.
   - `curr` is 0 (though this is not directly relevant to the loop).

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to start, `nums` must be a non-empty list because the loop iterates over each element of `nums`.
   - The variable `i` will start as the first element of `nums` and increment through each subsequent element until it reaches the last element (`last`).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `nums` must be a non-empty list.
- `i` must be set to the first element of `nums`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`nums` is a non-empty list, `i` is the first element of `nums`**.
