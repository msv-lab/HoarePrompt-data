Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 â‹… 10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`, meaning it is now half of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
