Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, meaning `i` starts at `n` and increments until it reaches `2 * n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `n + 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `res` remains an empty list because the loop body does not modify it.
   - `i` changes to `n + 2`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 2 because the loop body does not modify this value based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 2`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 2**.
