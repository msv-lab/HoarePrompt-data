Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 1, and `i` remains 2. The value of `n` is the integer input provided by the user.
