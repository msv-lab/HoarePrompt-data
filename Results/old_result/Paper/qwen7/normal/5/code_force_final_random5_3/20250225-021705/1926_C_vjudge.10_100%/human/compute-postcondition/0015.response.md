Output State: **`values[i + 1]` is `values[i] + sum_value_digits`, `sum_value_digits` is 0**

Explanation: The code sets `sum_value_digits` to 0. Since `values[i + 1]` was previously defined as `values[i] + sum_value_digits`, and `sum_value_digits` is now 0, the relationship between `values[i + 1]` remains unchanged from its previous definition. The value of `sum_value_digits` is explicitly set to 0.
