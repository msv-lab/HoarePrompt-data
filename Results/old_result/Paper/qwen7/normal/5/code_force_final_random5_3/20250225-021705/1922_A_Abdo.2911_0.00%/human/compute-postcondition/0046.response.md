Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either lowercase or not lowercase; `match_a_b` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `match_a_b`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or the character at index `i` in `template`. Therefore, these preconditions remain unchanged, and `match_a_b` is set to `False`.
