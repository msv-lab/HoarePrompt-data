You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it checks if the sequence of integers can be rearranged such that for every pair of consecutive elements, the first element is not less than the second element. If such a rearrangement is possible, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `m` and the array itself.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, indicating that the array is initially assumed to be sortable.
   
3. **Checking Array Order:**
   - The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (i.e., from `m-1` to `1`).
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`.
   - If it finds such a pair, it splits `arr[i-1]` into its individual digits and combines them with `arr[i]`.
   - It then checks if the combined list of digits is sorted.
   - If the combined list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   
4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, indicating the array cannot be sorted.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", indicating the array can be sorted.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Combining Digits:**
   - The program attempts to split `arr[i-1]` into digits and combine them with `arr[i]`. However, the logic for checking if the combined list is sorted is flawed.
   - The program should ensure that after splitting and combining, the resulting array is non-decreasing. Instead, it only checks if the combined list of digits is sorted, which is not sufficient.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array is already sorted or when the operations do not lead to a sorted array.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        # Function to split a number into its digits
        def split_number(num):
            return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
        
        # Function to check if the array is sorted
        def is_sorted(arr):
            return all(arr[i] <= arr[i+1] for i in range(len(arr)-1))
        
        ans = True
        while ans:
            ans = False
            for i in range(n-1):
                if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
                    nums = split_number(arr[i])
                    arr[i] = 0
                    arr[i:i+1] = nums + [arr[i+1]]
                    ans = True
                    break
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][is_sorted(arr)])

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Splitting Function:**
   - A helper function `split_number` is defined to split a number into its digits.

2. **Sorting Check Function:**
   - A helper function `is_sorted` is defined to check if the array is sorted.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic uses a while loop to repeatedly attempt to sort the array by splitting and recombining digits.
   - If a swap is made (i.e., `ans` is set to `True`), the loop continues until no more swaps are needed.
   - Finally, it checks if the array is sorted and prints the result accordingly.

### Conclusion

The original program has logical flaws and does not correctly implement the required functionality. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work as intended.
