Postcondition: `i` is 3 or 1, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains either the maximum value of `maxa` or the element `a[pb - 1]` or `p[pb - 1]`, and `pb` is equal to `p[pb - 1]` if the condition `a[pb - 1] == maxa` is met, otherwise `b` contains the element `p[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
