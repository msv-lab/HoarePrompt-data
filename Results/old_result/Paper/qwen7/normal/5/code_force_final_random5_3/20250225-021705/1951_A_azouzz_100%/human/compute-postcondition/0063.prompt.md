Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2:
        print('NO')
    elif cnt1 == 1:
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, `cnt1` remains greater than 2 and even. Otherwise, `cnt1` remains less than or equal to 2, and if `cnt1` is exactly 1, it remains unchanged. If `cnt1` is 0 or 2, it becomes even. If the string `s` contains the substring '11', the count of '1' becomes at least 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, `cnt1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cnt1` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 2 and even, `cnt1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cnt1` is set to the count of '1' in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
