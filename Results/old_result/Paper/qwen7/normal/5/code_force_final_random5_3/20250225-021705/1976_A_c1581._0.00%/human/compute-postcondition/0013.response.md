Postcondition: `password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly n-1 characters, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit from `password` if the first character was a digit, otherwise it remains the same; `letters` is a list containing all the characters from the `password` string that are not digits, with one additional character appended to it if the first character was a letter, and `char` is appended to the appropriate list (`digits` if `char` is a digit, otherwise `letters`).
