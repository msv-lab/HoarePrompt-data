Output State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` and `high` are updated based on the value of `arr[mid]` relative to `k`, `mid` is added to set `st` three times, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low + 1 < high` must hold true; `mid` is reassigned to the value of `(low + high) // 2**.

Explanation: The code snippet adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Since `mid` was already added to the set twice before this line, adding it again does not change its presence in the set. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
