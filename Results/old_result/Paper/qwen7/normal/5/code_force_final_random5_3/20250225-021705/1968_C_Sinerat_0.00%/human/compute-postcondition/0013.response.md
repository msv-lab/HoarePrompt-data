To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the process:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`, starting with `a[0] = 500`.

2. **Calculation Process**:
   - `a[0]` is explicitly given as 500.
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), it is calculated as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

Given this, let's assume a specific example to illustrate the calculation. Suppose `n = 4` and `x = [100, 200, 300, 400]`. We'll calculate the values of `a` step by step:

- `a[0] = 500` (given).
- `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + 100 = 600`.
- `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 600 + 200 = 800`.
- `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = 800 + 300 = 1100`.

So, the list `a` would be `[500, 600, 800, 1100]`.

Therefore, the print statement `print(*a)` will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **500 600 800 1100**
