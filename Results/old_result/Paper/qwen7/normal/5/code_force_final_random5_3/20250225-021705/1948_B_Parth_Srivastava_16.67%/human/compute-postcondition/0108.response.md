Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) followed by \( n \) integers (\( 2 \leq n \leq 50 \)) within the range [0, 99]. For each test case, it constructs a list \( c \) based on specific conditions involving the digits of the integers. It then sorts \( c \) and checks if the original list \( c \) was already sorted. If \( c \) was sorted, it appends 1 to a list \( b \); otherwise, it appends 0. The function ultimately returns the list \( b \).**
