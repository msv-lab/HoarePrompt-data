### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The provided solution attempts to construct such an array using a binary-like approach where each bit position corresponds to a value in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm initializes `max` and `min` values to represent the largest and smallest possible integers.
   - It uses a while loop to reduce `x` to 1 by repeatedly dividing it by 2 when it is even (this corresponds to setting a '1' bit in the binary representation) or decrementing it when it is odd (this corresponds to setting a '0' bit).
   - Each time a bit is set, the corresponding value (either `max` or `min`) is appended to the `ans` list, and the respective boundary value is adjusted.
   - After the loop, the `ans` list is reversed and printed along with its length.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `x` is 1, the algorithm correctly stops and prints the constructed array.
   - For `x` that cannot be represented within the constraints (i.e., the array length limit of 200), the algorithm will still attempt to construct an array but may not meet the exact requirement due to the fixed boundary values.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for constructing the array based on the binary representation of `x` is sound.
   - However, the implementation does not account for the possibility of generating more than one increasing subsequence per bit position, which is necessary to ensure the exact count of increasing subsequences.
   - The approach assumes that each bit position contributes independently to the count of increasing subsequences, which is not always true (e.g., consecutive identical values do not form new increasing subsequences).

5. **Test Case Verification**:
   - For `x = 2`, the output should be `[0]` (one increasing subsequence: the empty subsequence, and one subsequence: `[0]`).
   - For `x = 5`, the output should be `[0, 1, 0]` (increasing subsequences: [], [0], [1], [0, 1], [0]).
   - For `x = 13`, the output should be `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` (increasing subsequences: [], [2], [2], [2, 2], [3], [4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 4], [2, 3, 4], [2, 2, 3, 4], [2, 2, 2, 3, 4]).
   - For `x = 37`, the output should be `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` (constructed to match the required number of increasing subsequences).

Given the above analysis, the provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not guarantee the exact number of increasing subsequences for all inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

A more robust solution would need to consider the combinatorial nature of increasing subsequences and ensure that the constructed array meets the exact requirement of `X` increasing subsequences.
