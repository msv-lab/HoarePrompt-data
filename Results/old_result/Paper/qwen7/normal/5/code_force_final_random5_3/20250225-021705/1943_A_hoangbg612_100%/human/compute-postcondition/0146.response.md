Output State: **Postcondition: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `num` and the value is 1, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is equal to `num`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to the variable `cur`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
