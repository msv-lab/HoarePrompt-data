Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state's information about other variables remains unchanged, so they are still as they were before. The only change is that `n` now holds the value of the input converted to an integer.
