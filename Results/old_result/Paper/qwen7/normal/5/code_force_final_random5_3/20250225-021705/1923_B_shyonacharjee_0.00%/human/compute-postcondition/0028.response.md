Output State: **`i` is 1, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is updated to `monsters[1][0]`, `health` is updated to `monsters[1][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `2 * health`, and `success` is False.**

Explanation: The line `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increments `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`. From the initial state, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, so `total_bullets_used` becomes `health + health`, which is `2 * health`. All other variables remain unchanged.
