Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x`, which is being iterated over from the list `nums`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `nums` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` and its value is 1.
   - `res` contains the sum of combinations.
   - `t` is 0 or negative.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is iterating over `nums`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in `nums`.
   - The list `nums` will be reduced by one element since one element has already been processed.
   - All other variables (`num_of_lens`, `res`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but based on the given information, they do not change.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `num_of_lens` remains the same.
   - `res` remains the same.
   - `t` remains 0 or negative.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `nums` loses one element (the current `x`), so it must have at least one element remaining.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` and its value is 1, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining**.
