Output State: **`size` is 1**.

The initial state includes that `number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and for each test case, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function has been called to generate the sequence of numbers based on the input number. The code snippet sets `size` to 1, which means it initializes the size of some data structure or array to 1. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only updated variable is `size`, which is now 1.
