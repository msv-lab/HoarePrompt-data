Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2` or `n-1`, `left` is `mid-2`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` or `rightOne` is increased by 1 depending on whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or '1', `leftOne` is now `leftOne - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `leftOne -= 1` decreases the value of `leftOne` by 1. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `leftOne` is updated to its new value, while the other variables and their relationships stay the same.
