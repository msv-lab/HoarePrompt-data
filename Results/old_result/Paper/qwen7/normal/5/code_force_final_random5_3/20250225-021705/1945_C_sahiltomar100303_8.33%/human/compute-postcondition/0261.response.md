Output State: **`right` is less than `n`, `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right-1]` is '0', otherwise `trightOne` is decreased by 1 and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1. This means that `right` is now one more than its previous value. The conditions for updating `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` based on the value of `s[right-1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, if `s[right-1]` was '0', `trightZero` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `trightOne` is decreased by 1 and `tleftOne` is increased by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain as per the initial postcondition.
