Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical.

This means that the loop continues to increment `i` as long as the current element is equal to the next one, effectively skipping over consecutive duplicates. Once `i` reaches a point where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or it reaches the second last element of the array, the loop stops. At the end, `i` will be at the position right after the last group of consecutive duplicates, or at the end of the array if there were no duplicates. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
    j -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 3, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical, and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is `j - 1`, and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
