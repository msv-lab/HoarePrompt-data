Output State: **`start_year` is `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 1**

Explanation: The code reassigns `start_year` to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given that `x` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`. Since `start_year` was initially set to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` and now it is reassigned with the same expression, the value of `start_year` remains unchanged. The value of `x` stays as 1.
