Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and initializes an empty list `b` to store the results.
2. For each test case, the function `func_1()` is called, which processes the input array `a` and determines if it can be sorted into non-decreasing order by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their individual digits.
3. The function `func_1()`:
   - Reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - Initializes an empty list `c` and a counter `n` to keep track of the length of `c`.
   - Iterates through each element of `a` and applies the specified operations to construct `c`.
   - Sorts `c` and checks if `c` is already sorted.
   - Appends 1 to `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise appends 0.
4. After processing all test cases, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
- The function `func_1()` should not modify the original array `a`. Instead, it should work on a copy of `a` or directly on `c`.
- The function `func_1()` does not handle the case where the array `a` is already sorted before any operations are applied.
- The function `func_1()` does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` can be sorted by applying the operations multiple times.

Despite these issues, the overall logic of the function is correct in terms of checking if the array can be sorted by splitting larger numbers into their digits. The function correctly checks if the constructed list `c` is sorted, which is the key requirement.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function appears to be correct in determining whether the array can be sorted using the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
