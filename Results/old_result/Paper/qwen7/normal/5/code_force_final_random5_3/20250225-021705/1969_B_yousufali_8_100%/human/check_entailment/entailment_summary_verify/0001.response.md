### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to transform a binary string into a sorted (non-decreasing) order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost to achieve this.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It iterates through the string and counts the number of '1's (`n`).
   - If it encounters a '0' after seeing at least one '1', it adds `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`).

3. **Behavior of `func_1`:**
   - As mentioned in the original assessment, this function does not actually perform any cyclic shifts.
   - Instead, it calculates a value that seems to be related to the positions of '0's and '1's in the string.
   - Specifically, it counts the cost of moving all '0's to the beginning of the string, treating each group of '1's as a separate operation.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is indeed flawed because it does not account for the actual cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
   - For example, consider the string "101011":
     - The function would count the cost as `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`, but the actual minimum cost is 5 (explained in the problem note).

5. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

6. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The provided function summary states that `func_2` processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the function summary does not provide any additional insight into the correctness of the overall solution.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment correctly identified that `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
   - Therefore, the overall program, which relies on `func_1`, is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
