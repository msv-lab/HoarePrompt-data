Output State: **`thorn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`**.

The value of `thorn` is explicitly set to 0, while the values of `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
