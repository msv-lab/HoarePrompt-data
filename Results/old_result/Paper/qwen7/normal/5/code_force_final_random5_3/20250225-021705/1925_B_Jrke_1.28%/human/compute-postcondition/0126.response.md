Output State: **`i` is 3, `l` is a list where the second element is 3 and the third element is the maximum of the second element (3), and `ans` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `ans = max(l)` calculates the maximum value in the list `l`. Given the initial state, the list `l` has at least two elements, with the second element being 3. Since no other elements are specified, the third element is also 3 (as per the postcondition). The maximum of these elements is 3, so `ans` is assigned the value 3. The values of `i` and the structure of `l` remain unchanged.
