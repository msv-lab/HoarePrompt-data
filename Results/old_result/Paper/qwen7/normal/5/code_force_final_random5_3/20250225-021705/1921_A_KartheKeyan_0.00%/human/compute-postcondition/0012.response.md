Output State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[ (0, 0), (x, y) ]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` is still 0, `coord` remains as a list containing the tuples `(0, 0)` and `(x, y)`, `res` is still 0, and `i` is still 1. The values of `x` and `y` are the integers input by the user.
