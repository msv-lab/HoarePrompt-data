Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` attempts to count the cost of making the string sorted by treating each '0' followed by '1's as a separate operation. However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the breakpoints where the string changes from '0' to '1' or vice versa. For each segment between these breakpoints, we need to calculate the minimum cost to sort that segment. The cost for each segment is the length of the segment.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()
    n = len(s)
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        # Find the end of the current segment of '0's
        j = i
        while j < n and s[j] == '0':
            j += 1
        # If there are '0's, calculate the cost to move them to the front
        if j > i:
            ans += j - i
        # Move to the next segment
        i = j
        # Find the end of the current segment of '1's
        j = i
        while j < n and s[j] == '1':
            j += 1
        # If there are '1's, calculate the cost to move them to the back
        if j > i:
            ans += j - i
        i = j
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Your response:
Correctness: **True**
```

This solution correctly identifies segments of '0's and '1's and calculates the minimum cost to sort the string by moving these segments optimally.
