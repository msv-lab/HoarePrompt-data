Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `len(inpstr)`. These are the variables that determine whether the loop can execute.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `ind2` is 1
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop is if `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B'. Since `i` is 0, `inpstr[-0 - 1]` translates to `inpstr[-1]`.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for each `i` in the range from 0 to `len(inpstr) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, so the loop will check if `inpstr[-1]` is 'B'.

4. **Possible Outcomes**:
   - If `inpstr[-1]` is 'B', the loop would break and the state would remain as it is (since the loop would terminate).
   - If `inpstr[-1]` is not 'B', the loop will continue to the next iteration.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `ind2` remains unchanged at 1.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop will now be checked with `inpstr[-1]` (since `i` is now 1).

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `ind2` is 1**
