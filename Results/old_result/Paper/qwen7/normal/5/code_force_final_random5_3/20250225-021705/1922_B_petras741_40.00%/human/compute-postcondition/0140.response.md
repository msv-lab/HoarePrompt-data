Output State: **`j` is 1; `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2; `q[w[j]]` is also incremented by 1, so its new value is 2.**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `j` is 1 and `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1. The code `q[w[j]] += 1` means that the value of `q[w[j]]` (which is `q[w[1]]` since `j` is 1) is incremented by 1. Since `q[w[1]]` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, its new value is 2. Similarly, `q[w[j]]` (again, `q[w[1]]`) is incremented by 1, making its new value 2.
