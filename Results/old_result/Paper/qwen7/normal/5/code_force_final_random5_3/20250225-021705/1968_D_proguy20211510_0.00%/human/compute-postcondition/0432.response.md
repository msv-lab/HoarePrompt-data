Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb + b[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(b)-1`, `pres` is a list containing the sum of `ss + s[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `sb` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `s`, `s` is a non-empty list, `len(s)` is greater than 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list.**

The code initializes two empty lists `ptsb` and `ptss`. The values of `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `s`, and `len(s)` remain unchanged from their initial state.
