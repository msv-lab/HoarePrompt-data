Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and the value of t is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `buffer` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `buffer`. Since `t` was an input integer within the specified range before the code execution, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the only new variable introduced and initialized is `buffer`, which is an empty list.
