Output State: **`i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is 1, `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`**

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increments `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. Given that `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`, and assuming `x` is the first element of `values`, `x` would be `values[0]`. Since `values[0]` is `values[0] + 0`, `x` is `values[0]`. If `values[0]` is 1 (as it is the only logical consistent value given the initial conditions), then `int(x)` is 1, and `sum_value_digits` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`. The values of `i` and `values[1]` remain unchanged.
