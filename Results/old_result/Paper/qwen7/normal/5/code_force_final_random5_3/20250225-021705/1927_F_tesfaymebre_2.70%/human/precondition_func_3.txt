t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n⋅(n - 1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), and m represents the number of edges in the graph. u, v, and w are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6, representing the vertices and the weight of the edge between them.
