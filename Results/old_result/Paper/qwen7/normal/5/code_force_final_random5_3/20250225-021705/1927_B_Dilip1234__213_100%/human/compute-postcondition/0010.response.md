Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(26)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `s` is 'b'
   - `char_count[1]` is equal to 1

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 26.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the loop starts from `j = 0` and increments `j` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration where `j` is 1, the next value of `j` should be 2.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, and `char_count[1]`) are not part of the loop head and thus their values remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is 'b', and `char_count[1]` is equal to 1**
