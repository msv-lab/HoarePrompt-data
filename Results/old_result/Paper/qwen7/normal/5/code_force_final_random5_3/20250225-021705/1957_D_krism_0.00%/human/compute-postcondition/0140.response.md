Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is 2, `suf[0][1]` is -1**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1 and `suf[0][1]` is either 0 or -1, after decrementing, `suf[0][1]` becomes -1 (since decrementing 0 results in -1 and -1 results in -2, but the problem specifies it can only be 0 or -1). All other variables remain unchanged.
