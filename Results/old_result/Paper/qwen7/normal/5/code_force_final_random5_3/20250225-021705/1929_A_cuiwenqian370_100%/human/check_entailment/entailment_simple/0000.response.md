Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between every pair of consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the maximum beauty is achieved because the largest possible differences are between the smallest and largest elements when they are adjacent.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the reading of multiple test cases and arrays, and it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The main function calls `func_2`, which processes the input and prints the results.
   - The logic in `func_2` is consistent with the problem requirements and correctly uses `func_1` to compute the beauty for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases and arrays of different lengths.
   - It correctly processes the input and outputs the results.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
