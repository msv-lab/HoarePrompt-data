Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers split from the input.
- `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
- The current value of `b` is less than or equal to `a`.

The print statement is `print(a * n)`.

Given that `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the value of `k` would be determined by `min(n, b - a)`. Since `b` is less than or equal to `a`, `b - a` would be less than or equal to 0. Therefore, `k = min(n, b - a) = min(n, 0) = 0`.

However, the value of `k` does not affect the print statement `print(a * n)`. The print statement will simply output the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are the respective integers from the input)**
