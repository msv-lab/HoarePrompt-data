Output State: **`left` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `leftZero` must be less than (left + 1) // 2, `rightOne` is increased by 1, and the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'**.

This means that the value of `rightOne` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
