Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` made up of "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if the count of "U" in the string `s` is odd. If the count is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list. The final state of the program is that it has printed the results for all test cases, and the `results` list contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the count of "U" in the corresponding string `s`.**
