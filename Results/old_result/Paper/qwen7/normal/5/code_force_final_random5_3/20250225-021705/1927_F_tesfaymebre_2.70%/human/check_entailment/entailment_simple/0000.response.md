Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. Here's a breakdown of the key parts of the program:

1. **Graph Representation and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists.
   - Edges are stored in a list along with their weights.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Data Structure**:
   - A DSU class is used to manage connected components of the graph.
   - The `union` method ensures that the minimum edge weight in each connected component is tracked.
   - The `find` method efficiently finds the root of a component.

3. **Finding the Minimum Edge Weight Cycle**:
   - The program sorts the edges in descending order of weight.
   - It iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles.
   - When a cycle is detected, it checks if the minimum edge weight in the cycle is less than the current known minimum.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - A DFS is performed to trace the cycle once a minimal edge weight cycle is identified.
   - The DFS ensures that the cycle is simple (no repeated vertices).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimal edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also prints the vertices in the cycle in traversal order.

Given the detailed annotations and the logical flow of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the required functionality. The program handles all constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
