Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and if either `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, the postcondition remains as initially described.
