Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 2; `k` is greater than `i + 1`; `b` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`; `s` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Since `b` initially contained the element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, after appending `a[pb - 1]`, `b` now contains both `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`. The values of `i`, `k`, `s`, and the condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remain unchanged.
