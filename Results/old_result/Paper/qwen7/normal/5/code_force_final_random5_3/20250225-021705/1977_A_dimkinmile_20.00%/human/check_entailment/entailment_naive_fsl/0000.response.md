Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise 'No'. However, this logic is incorrect because:

- If `n` is odd and `m` is `(n + 1) / 2`, it is still possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. For example, in the case of `n = 5` and `m = 3`, Nikita can add 3 cubes and remove 2 cubes, resulting in a tower with 3 cubes. The current implementation would incorrectly print 'No' in this scenario.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, as this ensures that the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in exactly `m` cubes.
