Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is updated to 2 because the expression `i * i - i` evaluates to `2 * 2 - 2 = 2`. Thus, `x` is assigned the value `n - 2`. The values of `cnt`, `n`, `m`, and the condition that `m` must be greater than 1 remain unchanged.
