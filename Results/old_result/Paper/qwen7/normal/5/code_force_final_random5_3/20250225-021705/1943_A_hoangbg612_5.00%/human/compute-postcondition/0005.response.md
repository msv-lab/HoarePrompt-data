Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

The code initializes `cur` to -1, which does not affect the values of `T`, `S`, or `N`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
