Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0**

The code `res = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `res`. None of the other variables (`n`, `coord`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
