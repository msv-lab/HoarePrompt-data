Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and does not fully address the requirements of the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ones` and `sum`:**
   - The variable `ones` is intended to count the number of 1s in the subarray, but it is incorrectly initialized and updated.
   - The variable `sum` is intended to calculate the sum of elements in the subarray minus the number of 1s, but it is also incorrectly initialized and updated.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking if Subarray is Good:**
   - The logic used to check if the subarray is good is flawed. Specifically, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` does not correctly reflect the conditions required for a subarray to be good.

3. **Function `func_1` is Not Properly Defined:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not called properly within the loop. It should be called inside the loop to process each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

testCases = int(input())
for i in range(testCases):
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

    # Calculate prefix sums and counts of 1s
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    count_ones = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]
        count_ones[i] = count_ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)

    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue

        # Calculate the sum of the subarray and the number of 1s in the subarray
        sum_subarray = prefix_sum[r] - prefix_sum[l - 1]
        count_ones_in_range = count_ones[r] - count_ones[l - 1]

        # Check if the subarray is good
        if 2 * count_ones_in_range + (r - l + 1) - count_ones_in_range > sum_subarray:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version properly calculates the necessary values and checks the conditions correctly to determine if a subarray is good.
