Output State: **`i` is 2; `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[2] - mean`**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is updated by adding the value of `nums[i] - mean` to its current value. Given that `i` is initially 2 and `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`, the new value of `curr` becomes `nums[0] - mean + nums[2] - mean`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
