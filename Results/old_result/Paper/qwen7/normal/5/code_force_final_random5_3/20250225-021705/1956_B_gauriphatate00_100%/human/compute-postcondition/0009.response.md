Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`, and `count_a[num]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `count_a[num] += 1` increments the count of `num` in the dictionary `count_a`. Since `num` was already in `count_a`, its value is incremented by 1. The state of `num` as the next element in the list `a` remains unchanged.
