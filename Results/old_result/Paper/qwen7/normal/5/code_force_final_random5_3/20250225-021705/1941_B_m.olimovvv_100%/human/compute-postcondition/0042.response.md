Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i+2]` is equal to `b[i+2] - b[i]` for all i.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts the value of `b[i]` from itself, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0. This operation is performed for every index `i` in the list `b`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The updated state of `b` is such that each element `b[i+2]` is now equal to `b[i+2] - b[i]`, which simplifies to 0 since `b[i]` is set to 0.
