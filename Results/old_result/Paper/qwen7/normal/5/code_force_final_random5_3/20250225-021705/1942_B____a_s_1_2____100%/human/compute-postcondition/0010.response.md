Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]` where `i` is `n - 2`. Since `mex` is the minimum value between `mex` and `p[n-2]`, and `p[n-2]` is `mex - a[n-2]`, the value of `mex` remains unchanged from its previous state. Therefore, `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]` where `i` is `n - 2`. The other variables remain in their initial or previously determined states.
