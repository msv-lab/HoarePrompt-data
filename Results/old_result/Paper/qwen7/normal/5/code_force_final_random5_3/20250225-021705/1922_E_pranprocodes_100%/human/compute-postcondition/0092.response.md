Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `x`.
3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `max` is 100000000.
   - `min` is -100000000.
   - `ans` is [].
   - `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations (`i + t`).

4. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `x != 1` must be true. Since `x` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `x` is not equal to 1.

Given the current state, `x` is just described as an "input integer," which means its value is not specified. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `x` must not be equal to 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x` should not be equal to 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1**
