Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop variable) and `m`. However, since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, we focus on `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs `m - 2` times. This means that before the loop starts, `m` must be at least 3 (as stated in the initial state).

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be such that `m - 2` remains valid. Since the loop runs `m - 2` times, `m` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: 
   - `m` must be at least 4.
   - `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `val` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` must be at least 4, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(a3, l3)`**
