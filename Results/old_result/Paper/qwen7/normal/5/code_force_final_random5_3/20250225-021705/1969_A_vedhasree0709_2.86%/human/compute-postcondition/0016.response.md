Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no loops or if statements are specified in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
