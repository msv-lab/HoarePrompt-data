Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `match_a_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains False.
