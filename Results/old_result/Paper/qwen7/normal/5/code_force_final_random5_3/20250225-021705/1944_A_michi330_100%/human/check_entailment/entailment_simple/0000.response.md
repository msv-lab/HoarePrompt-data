Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k` for each case.
3. The logic inside the loop is correct:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, printing `1` is correct because Everule can be blocked from reaching any other island except his own.
   - Otherwise, printing `n` is correct because even with some bridges destroyed, Everule can still reach all islands.
4. The loop and conditional statements handle the constraints and requirements of the problem accurately.
5. The final state of the variables after processing all test cases matches the expected behavior.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
