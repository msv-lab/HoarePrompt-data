Output State: **`colors` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `node_u` and `node_v` point to the two nodes that form the MST, `dsu.min_edge` reflects the minimum edge weight within the connected component that `node_u` belongs to, and `_min_edge` holds the overall minimum edge weight found during the entire execution of the loop.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `colors` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `node_u`, `node_v`, `dsu.min_edge`, or `_min_edge`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states, which are defined in the initial state.
