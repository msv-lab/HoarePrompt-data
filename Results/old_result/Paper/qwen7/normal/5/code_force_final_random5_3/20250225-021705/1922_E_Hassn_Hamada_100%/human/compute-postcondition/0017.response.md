Output State: `size_overlap` is (2, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 2, `size` is `i + 3`, `value` is \(2^{i+3} - 2^i\).

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `size` will continue to increment until the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number` is no longer satisfied. Given the pattern from the first three iterations, we can infer that after the loop completes, `size` will be `i + 3`, where `i` is at least 2. The `value` will be calculated as \(2^{i+3} - 2^i\). The `size_overlap` remains (2, 1) as it was not affected by the loop, and `sequence` and `number` must remain non-negative and satisfy the conditions derived from the loop's execution.
