Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, as the loop runs in reverse from `n-1` to `0`. For each iteration, `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]`, and `mex` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `p[i]`. The final state of `p` will be a list where each element `p[i]` (for `i` from `0` to `n-1`) is the minimum value of `mex` observed during the loop minus the corresponding element `a[i]` from the input list. The variable `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the list `p`.

This means that `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the modified list `p`, which is derived from the original list `a` through the described operations.
