Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a predefined set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and a list of integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns a specific value or result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases defined externally, each containing a value for t, n, and a list a. It then performs some unspecified operation on these inputs and returns a result for each test case.
