Postcondition: `t` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, and `w` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each iteration from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]` for each iteration from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, `t` remains unchanged and `i` is incremented by 1.
