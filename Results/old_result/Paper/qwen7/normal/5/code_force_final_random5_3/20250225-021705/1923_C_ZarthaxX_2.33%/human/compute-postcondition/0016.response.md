State: **`ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `q` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**.

### Explanation:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is an iterator) and `q` (the number of iterations).
2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0.
   - `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index.
   - `q` determines how many times the loop will run.
3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `q` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is initialized to 0 and will increment with each iteration.
4. **Other Variables**: Variables `n`, `t`, `c`, and `nums` are not modified within the loop, so their initial states remain unchanged.

Thus, the only states that need adjustment are `q` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
