Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The approach used in `func_1` is inefficient and incorrect for the given problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Memory Usage**: The program uses an array `values` of size `2 * 10^5 + 1` to store the cumulative sum of digit sums for all numbers up to `2 * 10^5`. This is unnecessary and consumes a lot of memory, which is not required for the problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The program calculates the cumulative sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `inf`, which is not needed. Instead, it should calculate the sum of digit sums for each number individually when prompted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total_sum += sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

This version directly calculates the sum of the digit sums for each number from 1 to `n` without using unnecessary memory.
