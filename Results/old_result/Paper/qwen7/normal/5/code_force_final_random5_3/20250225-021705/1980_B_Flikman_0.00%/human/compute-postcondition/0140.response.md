Based on the initial state provided:

- `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the list `a` that are less than `favorite_value`.
- `k` is greater than `greater_count`.
- The sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or their values; it directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
