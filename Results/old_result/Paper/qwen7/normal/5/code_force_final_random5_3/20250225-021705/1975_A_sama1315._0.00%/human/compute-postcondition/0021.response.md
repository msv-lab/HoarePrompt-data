Output State: **`index` is 8 + `n` + `n`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the value of `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[8 + `n` + `n` : 8 + `2*n`], `n` is an integer obtained from `data[8 + `n` + `n`]**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n`. Since `index` is initially `8 + n + n`, `n` is set to the value of `data[8 + n + n]`. The other variables (`t`, `results`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
