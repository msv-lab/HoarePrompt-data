Output State: **`i` is 1, `ind2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block provided, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `ind2`. It simply indicates that if there was a loop or conditional block, we would have exited it. The last character of `inpstr` remains 'B'.
