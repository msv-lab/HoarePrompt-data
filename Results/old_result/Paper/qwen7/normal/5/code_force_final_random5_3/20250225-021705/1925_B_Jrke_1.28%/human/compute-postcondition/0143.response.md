Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `l` will contain all such divisors, and `ans` will be the maximum value among these divisors.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will hold the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. The loop iterates through all odd numbers up to the square root of `x`, checking if they are divisors of `x` and updating `ans` with the maximum divisor found that meets the criteria. The list `l` keeps track of these divisors, ensuring that `ans` is always updated to the maximum value found.
