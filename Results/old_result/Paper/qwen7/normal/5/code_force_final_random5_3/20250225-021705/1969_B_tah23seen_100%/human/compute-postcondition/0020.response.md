Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` (the current character being processed) and `s` (the binary string).

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `i` is the character being processed in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000.
   - `i` is the second character of `s`.
   - Depending on the value of `i`, `cost` and `one` may change.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second character of `s`, in the next iteration, `i` will be the third character of `s`.
   - `s` remains the same binary string, but it now starts from the third character.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

- `s` remains the same binary string.
- `i` becomes the third character of `s`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000, `i` is the third character of `s`**.
