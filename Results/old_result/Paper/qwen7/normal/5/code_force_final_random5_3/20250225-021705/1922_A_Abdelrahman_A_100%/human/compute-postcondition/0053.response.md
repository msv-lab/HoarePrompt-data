Output State: **`no` is False, `c` must contain at least one character, x is not present in `a[counter]` and x is not present in `b[counter]`**

Explanation: The line `no = False` sets the variable `no` to `False`. The initial conditions for `c`, `x` in `a[counter]`, and `x` in `b[counter]` remain unchanged.
