Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string starting with '-', `char` is not '+', and `balance` is decreased by 1.**

The code `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `expression` is a non-empty string starting with '-' and `char` is not '+', these conditions remain unchanged. The only variable affected is `balance`, which is decreased by 1.
