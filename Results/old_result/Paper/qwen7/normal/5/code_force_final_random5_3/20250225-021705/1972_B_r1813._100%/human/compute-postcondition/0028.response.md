Based on the initial state provided:

- `data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element.
- `n` is the integer at index 4 of `data`.
- `s` is the string at index 6 of `data`.
- `index` is 8.
- `count_u` is the number of 'U's in the string `s`.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `count_u` is updated to the number of 'U's in the string `s`.
- If `count_u` is even, `s` is reassigned to the string at index 7 of `data`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of other variables.

Output: **YES**
