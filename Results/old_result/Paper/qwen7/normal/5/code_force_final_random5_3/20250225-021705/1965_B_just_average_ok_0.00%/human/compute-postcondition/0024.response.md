The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. Initially, `idx` was 0, so now `idx` is 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and the additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]` remain unchanged. The element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has still been removed from `nums`.

Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` is the second integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.**
