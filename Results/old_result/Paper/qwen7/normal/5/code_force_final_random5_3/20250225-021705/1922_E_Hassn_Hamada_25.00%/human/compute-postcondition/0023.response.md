Output State: **`size` is 5, `i` is 4, `sequence` is modified such that its element at index -result - i - 1 is incremented by `result`.**

Given the code snippet and the initial state, we need to determine the impact on the variables and the sequence. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `sequence` or `result`. Since `result` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact modification to the sequence. But we can express the modification in terms of `result`.

The code `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` means that the element in the sequence at the index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by the value of `result`. Given `i` is 4, the index becomes `-result - 4 - 1 = -result - 5`. Therefore, the element at index `-result - 5` in the sequence is incremented by `result`.

Output State: **`size` is 5, `i` is 4, `sequence` is modified such that its element at index -result - 5 is incremented by `result`.**
