Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`; `mex` is updated to the minimum value between `mex` and `p[i]`; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum value between its current value and `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`, `p[i]` remains unchanged by this operation. Therefore, `mex` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `p[i]`.
