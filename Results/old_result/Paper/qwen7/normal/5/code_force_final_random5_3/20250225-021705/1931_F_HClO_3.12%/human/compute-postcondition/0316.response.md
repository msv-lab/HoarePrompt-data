Output State: **`m` must be at least 5; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `p1` and `p2`, both to 0. The initial conditions for `m`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged. Therefore, `m` must still be at least 5, `idx1` is -1, and `idx2` is -1. Additionally, `p1` is now 0 and `p2` is also 0.
