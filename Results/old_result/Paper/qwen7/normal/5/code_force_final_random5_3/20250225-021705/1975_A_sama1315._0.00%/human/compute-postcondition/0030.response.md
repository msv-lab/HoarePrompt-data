Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 1000), n (an integer between 2 and 50), and arr (a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6). The function returns a value based on the input parameters.**

This means the function `func_2` takes an integer `t` within the range of 1 to 1000, an integer `n` within the range of 2 to 50, and a list `arr` containing `n` integers, each of which is within the range of 1 to 10^6. Based on these inputs, the function will produce some output, though the specific nature of this output is not detailed in the given information.
