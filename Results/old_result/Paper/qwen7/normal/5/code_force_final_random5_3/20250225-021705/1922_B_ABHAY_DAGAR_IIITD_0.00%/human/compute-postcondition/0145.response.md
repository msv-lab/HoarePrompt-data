Output State: **`cnt` is an integer, and `res` is updated to `res` plus `cnt` times (`cnt` minus 1) times (`cnt` minus 2) divided by 6, provided that `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged; `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increases the value of `total_count` by the current value of `cnt`. The conditions for updating `res` remain unchanged. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated according to the given formula. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.
