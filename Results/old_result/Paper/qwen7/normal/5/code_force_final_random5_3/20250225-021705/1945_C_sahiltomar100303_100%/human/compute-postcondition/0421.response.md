Output State: **`tleftOne` is increased by 1, `right` remains `mid`, `n` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is now `trightOne - 1`, and `s[right]` is not equal to '0'**.

This means that the value of `trightOne` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain in their previous states.
