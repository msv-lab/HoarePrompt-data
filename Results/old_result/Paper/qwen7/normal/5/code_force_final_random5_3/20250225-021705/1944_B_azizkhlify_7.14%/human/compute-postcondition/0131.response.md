Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `k` is the second integer input minus 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `ul` equals `ur` if `ul` does not equal `ur`, `l` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `l` with `n` zeros. The values of `res`, `i`, `k`, `a`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged from their initial states.
