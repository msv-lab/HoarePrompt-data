Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
