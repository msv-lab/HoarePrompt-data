Output State: **`cur` is -1, `i` is the value of `cur` minus 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `S` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `cur` is reassigned to `-1`. The value of `i` is updated to be `cur - 1`, which means `i` becomes `-2`. The values of `N` and `S` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
