Output State: **`j` is 1; `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2; `q[w[j]]` is also incremented by 1, so its new value is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is initially set to 1. The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Since `j` is 1, `q[w[j]]` is equivalent to `q[w[1]]`. Given that `q[w[1]]` was initially incremented by 1, its new value is 2. Therefore, `q[w[j]]` (which is `q[w[1]]`) is also incremented by 1, making its new value 2.
