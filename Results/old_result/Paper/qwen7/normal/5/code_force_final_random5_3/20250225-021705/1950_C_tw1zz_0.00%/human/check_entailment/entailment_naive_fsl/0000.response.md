Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the conversion correctly for all cases. Specifically, it fails to convert times starting with '13' to '01 PM'. For example, if the input is '13:00', the program should output '01:00 PM', but it incorrectly outputs '01:00 AM'. This is because the program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to manually map each hour from 00 to 23 to its corresponding 12-hour format, which is inefficient and prone to errors. A more robust solution would involve using modulo arithmetic to handle the conversion, ensuring that all cases are correctly handled.
