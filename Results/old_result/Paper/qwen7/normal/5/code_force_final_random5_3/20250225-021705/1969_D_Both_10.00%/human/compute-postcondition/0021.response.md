Postcondition: `sub_sum` is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` must contain at least one element and will have one less element than before. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_sum` is updated to `sub_sum + val_b[0] + val_b[1]`. Otherwise, `sub_sum` remains unchanged.
