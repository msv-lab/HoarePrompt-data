The loop condition in the given `while` statement is `i <= n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i <= n - 1` must be true after the adjustment.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `i` is 1
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)
- `n` must be at least 1
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
- `j` is 1
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the value of `i` must be such that it satisfies the condition `i <= n - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `1 <= n - 1` implies `n > 1`).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
