Output State: **The final value of `s` is the original value of `s` plus the sum of the integer values of all elements in `list2` at even indices; `i` is equal to `2 * len(list2)`; `final` contains the list `[s]`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over `list2` with a step of 2, summing the integer values of elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) into `s`. After the loop, `s` holds the sum of these elements. The variable `i` is updated to `2 * len(list2)`, as it increments by 2 in each iteration. The value of `s` is appended to the list `final`.
