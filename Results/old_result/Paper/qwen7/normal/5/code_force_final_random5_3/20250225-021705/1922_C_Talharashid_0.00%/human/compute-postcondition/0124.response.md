Output State: **`start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, `i` is 0, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`**.

The code calculates the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` and assigns it to `s2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
