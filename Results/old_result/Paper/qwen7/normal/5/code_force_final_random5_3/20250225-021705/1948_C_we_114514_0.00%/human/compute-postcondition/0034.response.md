Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n - 1`.
   - If `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `reachable_first_row` is either True or False.
   - `reachable_second_row` is True.
   - `j` is less than `n - 1`.
   - `row2[j]` is greater than '>' unless `j` equals `n - 1`, in which case `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged and `j` is equal to `n - 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop will continue.
   - Increment `j` by 1.
   - `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged if `j` is not equal to `n - 1`.
   - If `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged and `j` becomes `n - 1`.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`results` is an empty list, `reachable_first_row` is either True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is less than `n`, and `row2[j]` is greater than '>' unless `j` equals `n` minus 1, in which case `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged and `j` is equal to `n` minus 1.**

However, since `j` is incremented by 1 in the next iteration, the condition for `j` should be adjusted accordingly:

State: **`results` is an empty list, `reachable_first_row` is either True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is less than `n`, and `row2[j]` is greater than '>' unless `j` equals `n` minus 1, in which case `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged and `j` is equal to `n` minus 1.**

For clarity, let's reformat it:

State: **`results` is an empty list, `reachable_first_row` is either True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is less than `n`, and `row2[j]` is greater than '>' unless `j` equals `n` minus 1, in which case `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged and `j` is equal to `n` minus 1.**
