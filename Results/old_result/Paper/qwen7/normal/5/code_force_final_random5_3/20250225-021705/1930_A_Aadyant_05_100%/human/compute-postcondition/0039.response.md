Output State: **`list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least 1 word; `list2` contains an element which is the integer representation of the next word in `list1`; `list2` is appended with the integer value of `str`.**

This means that the string `str` has been converted to an integer and added to `list2`. The contents of `list1` remain unchanged, and `list2` now includes the integer value of the next word from `list1`.
