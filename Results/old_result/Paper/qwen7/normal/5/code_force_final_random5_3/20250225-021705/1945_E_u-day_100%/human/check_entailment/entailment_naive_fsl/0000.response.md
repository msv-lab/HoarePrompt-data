Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the program uses a binary search approach to find the position of `x` in the permutation `arr`. However, the binary search implementation is flawed because it does not properly handle the case when the middle element is greater than `x` and updates the `low` and `high` pointers incorrectly.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in the `func_3` function is flawed. When `arr[mid] > k`, the code updates `high = mid`, which is incorrect. It should update `low = mid + 1` instead. This error leads to incorrect results when searching for the position of `x`.

2. **Set Usage**: The variable `st` is used to store mid values, but it is not necessary for the binary search and does not affect the outcome of the search. However, its presence does not contribute to the correctness of the binary search logic.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The number 3 should be swapped with the number at position 2 (index 1) to make the permutation `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]` such that `p_l` is equal to 3 after the binary search.

- Actual Output:
  - The program outputs `0`, indicating no swaps are needed, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
