Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `suf[0][1]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `pre[1][0]` is 2, and `suf[1][0]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, the value of `pre[1][0]` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
