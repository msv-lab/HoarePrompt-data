### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If `func_1(list1)` returns `False`, it means the list is not sorted.
   - It then checks if the previous element (`list1[p - 1]`) is greater than the current element (`list1[p]`) and if the previous element is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it performs the digit-splitting operation:
     - Removes the element at index `p - 1`.
     - Inserts the integer division (`a // 10`) at the same position.
     - Inserts the modulus (`a % 10`) at the next position.
   - After potentially performing the digit-splitting operation, it checks if the list is now sorted using `func_1(list1)`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.

### Analysis:

- **Digit-Splitting Operation:**
  - The digit-splitting operation is performed only when the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is at least 10.
  - This ensures that the operation is only applied to elements that can be split into smaller parts.

- **Sorting Check:**
  - After performing the digit-splitting operation, the program checks if the list is sorted using `func_1(list1)`.
  - If the list is sorted, it prints "Yes".
  - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
```

1. **Initial List:**
   - `[12, 3, 45, 67]`

2. **First Iteration (p = 1):**
   - `list1[0] = 12` (which is >= 10), `list1[1] = 3`
   - Since `12 > 3`, the digit-splitting operation is performed:
     - Remove `12` and insert `1` and `2` at positions 0 and 1 respectively.
   - New list: `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`

3. **Second Iteration (p = 2):**
   - `list1[1] = 2`, `list1[2] = 3`
   - The list is already sorted, so no further operations are needed.

4. **Third Iteration (p = 3):**
   - `list1[2] = 3`, `list1[3] = 45`
   - Since `3 < 45`, no operation is performed.

5. **Fourth Iteration (p = 4):**
   - `list1[3] = 45`, `list1[4] = 67`
   - Since `45 < 67`, no operation is performed.

6. **Final Check:**
   - The final list is `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is not sorted.
   - The program prints "No".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to check if the list can be sorted by splitting elements that are at least 10. The digit-splitting operation is performed only when necessary, and the final check ensures that the list is sorted.

Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
