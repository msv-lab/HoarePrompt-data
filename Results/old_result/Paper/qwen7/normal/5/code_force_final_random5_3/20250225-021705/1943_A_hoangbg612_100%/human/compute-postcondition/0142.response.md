Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `num` and the value is 1, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is `cur + 1`, and `N` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces with one less element than before.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions for `T`, `M`, `cnt`, and `N` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `cur` is `cur + 1`.
