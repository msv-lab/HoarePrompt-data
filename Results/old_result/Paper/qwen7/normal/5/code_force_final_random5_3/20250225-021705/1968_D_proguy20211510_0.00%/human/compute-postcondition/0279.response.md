Output State: **`preb` contains the sum of `sb + b[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `k-1`, `sb` is the cumulative sum of `b[i]` from 0 to `k-1`, `pres` contains the sum of `ss + s[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `k-1`, and `ss` is the cumulative sum of `s[i]` from 0 to `k-1`; `ptsb` is an empty list; `ptss` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `ptsb` and `ptss`. This does not affect the values of `preb`, `sb`, `pres`, `ss`, `b`, or `s`. Therefore, the values of `preb`, `sb`, `pres`, and `ss` remain unchanged, while `ptsb` and `ptss` are now empty lists.
