Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i+1` or `-1`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `idx2` is updated to `i`, while `m`, `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n` retain their initial conditions.
