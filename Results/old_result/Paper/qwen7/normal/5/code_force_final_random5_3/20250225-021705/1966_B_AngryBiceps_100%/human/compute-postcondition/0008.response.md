Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments the value of `last_row` by the last element of the last element in the list `a`. Since `a` contains only one element, which is a list itself (due to the structure `a = [input()]`), `a[-1]` refers to that single list, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last element of that list. The initial state does not provide the specific value of the input, but it is known that `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the only list in `a`.
