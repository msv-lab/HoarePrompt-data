Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, and `cnt1`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
