Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and organizes the test cases into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of columns `n` and the two rows of the grid.
2. The function `func_1` iterates through each test case and checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
3. The logic within the function:
   - Initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.
   - Iterates through each column `j` of the grid.
   - Checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row based on the direction of the arrows.
   - Updates the `reachable_second_row` flag accordingly.
4. After processing all columns for a test case, the function appends 'YES' to the results list if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, otherwise it appends 'NO'.
5. The function correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as per the problem statement.
6. The output is generated based on the logic described above, which matches the expected behavior.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
