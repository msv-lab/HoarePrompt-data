Output State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `test_cases` is decremented by 1, and since it was initially greater than 0, it remains greater than 0 after the decrement. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input, which is a new variable introduced by the code.
