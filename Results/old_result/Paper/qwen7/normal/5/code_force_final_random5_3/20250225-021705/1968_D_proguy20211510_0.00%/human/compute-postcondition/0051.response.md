Postcondition: `i` is 0, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the element `(k - 1) * maxa` and possibly `a[pb - 1]` depending on the condition, `s` contains the element `(k - 2) * maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, and either `foundb` is True or `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `foundb` is True, or `foundb` is False or `founds` is False.
