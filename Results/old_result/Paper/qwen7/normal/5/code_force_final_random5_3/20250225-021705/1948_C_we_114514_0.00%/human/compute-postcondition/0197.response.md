Output State: **`reachable_second_row` is `True`**.

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` regardless of the previous value of `reachable_second_row` or the values of `row1[j]`, `row2[j]`, `n`, `test_case`, or `j`. Therefore, after executing the line `reachable_second_row = True`, the only change is that `reachable_second_row` is now `True`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
