The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a series of strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For each test case, it checks if for every position `i` in the strings, either `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If this condition holds for all positions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
