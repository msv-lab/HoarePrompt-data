Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, `i`, or `nums`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement the program was in, which is not specified in the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.
