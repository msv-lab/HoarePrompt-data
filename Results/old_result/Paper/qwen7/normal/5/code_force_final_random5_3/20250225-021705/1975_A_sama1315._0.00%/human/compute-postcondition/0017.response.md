Output State: **`index` is 8 + n + n, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `arr` is updated to a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**.

In natural language: The value of `index` is updated by adding `n` to its current value, making it `8 + n + n`. The value of `t` is still greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1. The `results` list remains unchanged except for having one additional element, which is the return value of `func_1(arr)`. The `arr` list is still a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]` and is updated to a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, where `index` is now `8 + n`. The value of `n` remains the integer value of `data[index]`.
