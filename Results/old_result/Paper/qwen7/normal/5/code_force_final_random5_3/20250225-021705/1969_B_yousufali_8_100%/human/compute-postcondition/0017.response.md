Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a string with length at least 1, `n` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `n + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += n + 1` increments `ans` by the value of `n + 1`. Given that `n` was incremented by 1 from its previous state, let's denote the original value of `n` before incrementation as `n_original`. So, `n` is now `n_original + 1`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n_original + 1 + 1) = ans + n_original + 2`. Since `ans` was not defined before, we assume it starts as 0, making `ans` equal to `n_original + 2`. Given that `n` was incremented by 1, `n` itself is now `n_original + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 2` when considering the final state. All other variables (`i` and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
