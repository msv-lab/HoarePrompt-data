Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `index` is increased by `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the `result` as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`**

Explanation: The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. Given that `index` was previously increased by `n + int(data[index]) + 1`, the new increase is simply `n`. Therefore, the total increase in `index` is now `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
