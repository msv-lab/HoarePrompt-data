Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop condition is `start != end`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `start` and `end`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `start` is incremented by `inc` at each iteration.
   - `end` remains unchanged.
   - `start` is initially set to some value and is incremented until it equals `end`.

3. **Condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `start` must not equal `end`.
   - Given that `start` is incremented by `inc` at each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `start` is less than `end`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `end` is unchanged, it remains the same as the initial value.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `start` must be less than `end`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `start` is less than `end` for the next iteration.

**State:**
- `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`.
- `start` must be less than `end`.
- `end` is unchanged.
- `inc` is unchanged.
- `s` is updated to `d1[start] = s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
- `i` is unchanged.
- `m` is unchanged.
- `d2` is unchanged.
- `s2` is unchanged.
- `s1` is unchanged.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `lst` is unchanged.

**Final State:**
State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`; `start` must be less than `end`; `end` is unchanged; `inc` is unchanged; `s` is updated to `d1[start] = s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; `i` is unchanged; `m` is unchanged; `d2` is unchanged; `s2` is unchanged; `s1` is unchanged; `n` is unchanged; `lst` is unchanged.**
