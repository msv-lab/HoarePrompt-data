Output State: **All entries in `M` are either 0 or 1, with exactly `len(N)` ones in total, `cur` is equal to `len(N)`, `i` is equal to `len(N) - 1`, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input split by spaces and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. This creates a new list `N` containing the integers from the input. The values of `M`, `cur`, `i`, `S`, and `T` remain unchanged from their initial states.
