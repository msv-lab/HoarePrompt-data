Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part. This means the loop will iterate based on the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is the integer obtained from the input split.
   - `f` is now `f-1`.
   - `k` is `f-2`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split, sorted in descending order.
   - `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`.
   - The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is defined by `range(int(input()))`, the number of iterations left will decrease by 1 each time the loop runs.
   - Therefore, the number of iterations left will be `int(input()) - 2` after the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `num` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `f` will be `f-2` (as given).
   - `k` will be `f-2` (as given).
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - The number of iterations left will be `int(input()) - 2`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer obtained from the input split, `f` is now f-2, `k` is f-2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`**.
