Output State: **`p1` is 1, `p2` is either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` is `i`; `idx2` is either `n-1` and `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`.**

Explanation: The code sets `p1` to 1. The values of `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` is greater than 1 also remains valid.
