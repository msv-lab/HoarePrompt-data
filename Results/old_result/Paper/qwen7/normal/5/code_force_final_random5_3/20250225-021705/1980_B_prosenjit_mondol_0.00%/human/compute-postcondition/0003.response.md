Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `f` is one less than the integer obtained from the input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the input split minus 1.**

The code `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. Since `k` was originally an integer obtained from the input split, now `k` is that integer minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
