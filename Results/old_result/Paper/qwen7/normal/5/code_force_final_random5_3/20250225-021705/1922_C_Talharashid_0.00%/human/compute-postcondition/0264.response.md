Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 (as per the typical initialization in a `for i in range(m)` loop).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < m`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the State**: Given that `i` starts at 0 and the loop condition is `i < m`, the initial state of `i` should be 0, and `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Other States**: The other states (`inc`, `start`, `end`, `mini`, `s`, `d1`, `d2`, `s2`, `s1`, `n`, and `lst`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
