### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the provided code is incorrect because it only counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` and does not account for the optimal strategy of both players. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not simulate the game or consider Nene's optimal moves to minimize your score.

However, let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code again:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - You need to determine the maximum number of points you can get by optimally choosing cards to play against Nene, who also plays optimally.
   - Nene always tries to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of numbers on the cards in your hand (`a`).
   - It then calls a function `func_1` to compute the maximum number of points you can get.
   - The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each number in your hand using a dictionary `count_a`.
   - It then iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`, checking if they exist in `count_a`. If a number exists and its count is 2, it increments the `max_score`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` only counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a`. This is a crucial part of the solution because if you have two cards with the same number, you can always play one of them and get a point, assuming Nene does not have a card with the same number to counter it.
   - The function does not simulate the entire game or account for Nene's optimal strategy directly. However, the problem statement specifies that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. This means that if you have a pair of the same number, you can always play one of them and get a point, knowing that Nene will not have a card to counter it (since she is trying to minimize your score).

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1, 1, 2, 3. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2, 3, 4, 4.
   - If you play the card with the number 1, Nene will not have a card with the number 1 to counter it, so you get 1 point. Similarly, if you play the card with the number 2, Nene will not have a card with the number 2 to counter it, so you get another point.
   - The function correctly counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand, which is 1 in this case.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand, which is the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene will always try to minimize your score.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided code is correct according to the problem statement and the optimal strategy described.
