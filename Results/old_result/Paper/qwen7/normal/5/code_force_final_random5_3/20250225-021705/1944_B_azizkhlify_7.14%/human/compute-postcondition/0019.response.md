Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n + 1` and less than `2 * n`.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = n` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1` and less than `2 * n`.

2. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 2`.

3. **State Adjustment:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to `n + 2` for the next iteration.
   - The condition `i < 2 * n` must still hold true.

### Updated State
- `i` will be `n + 2`.
- The condition `i < 2 * n` should still be satisfied.

### Final State
- `i` is `n + 2` and less than `2 * n`.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop head.

### Answer
State: **`i` is `n + 2` and less than `2 * n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
