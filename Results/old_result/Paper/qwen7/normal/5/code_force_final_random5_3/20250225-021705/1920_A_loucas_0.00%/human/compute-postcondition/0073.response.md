Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `a` is appended to `no`, `iterable2` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, and `x` is not equal to 2**.

In this case, the code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since no list `no` was mentioned in the initial state, we assume it's a new list being created. The other variables remain unchanged.
