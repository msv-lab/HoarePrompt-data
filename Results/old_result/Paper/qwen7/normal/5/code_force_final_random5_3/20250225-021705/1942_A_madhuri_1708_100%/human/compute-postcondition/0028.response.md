Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer obtained from the second line of input split and converted to integer, `k` is an integer obtained from the second line of input split and converted to integer, `s` is the next line of input.**

Explanation: Since the if condition checks whether `n == k`, and both the if and else parts have the same postcondition, the overall postcondition remains unchanged. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `s` remain as they were before the if-else block executes.
