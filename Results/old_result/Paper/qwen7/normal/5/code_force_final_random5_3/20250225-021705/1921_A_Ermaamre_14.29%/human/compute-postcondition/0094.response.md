Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` must be greater than 0 (though its specific value isn't needed for this calculation).
- `i` is explicitly defined as 2.
- `x1` and `y1` are input integers.
- `x2` and `y2` are input integers from the second input.
- `x3` and `y3` are input integers.
- `x4` and `y4` are integers from the input split by space.
- `res` is defined as follows:
  - If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.
  - Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.

The expression to be evaluated is `res ** 2`.

To determine the output, we need to consider both conditions for `res`:

1. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res = |y1 - y3|`.
2. Otherwise, `res = |y1 - y2|`.

In either case, `res` is the absolute difference between two y-values. Squaring this value will give us the result.

Given that the exact values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, and `y3` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these values.

Output: **(|y1 - y3| ** 2) if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4, else (|y1 - y2| ** 2)**
