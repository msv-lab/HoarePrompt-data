Output State: **`index` is 7 + n, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n`, where `index` is initially `7 + n`. After this assignment, `n` holds the integer value of `data[index]`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
