Postcondition: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is False, `i` equals `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase letter if and only if the character at index `i` in `c` (converted to lowercase) matches the current value of `template[i]` (also converted to lowercase). If they do not match, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, no change occurs to the variables.
