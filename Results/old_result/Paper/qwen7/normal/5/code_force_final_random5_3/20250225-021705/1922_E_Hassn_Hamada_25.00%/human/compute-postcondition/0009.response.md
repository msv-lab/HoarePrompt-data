Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `size` is 3 and `number` must be greater than or equal to 7.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as the expression `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`.

2. **Current Values**:
   - `size` is 3.
   - `number` must be greater than or equal to 7.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**:
   - Calculate `(1 << size + 1) - 1`:
     \[
     (1 << (3 + 1)) - 1 = (1 << 4) - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15
     \]
   - The loop condition becomes `15 <= number`.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `number` must be greater than or equal to 15 in the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `number` must be at least 15. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `number` to reflect this requirement.

### Final Answer:
State: **`size` is 3 and `number` must be greater than or equal to 15**
