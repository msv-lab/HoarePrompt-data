Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y; x` and `y` are updated to the values entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of `q` and the condition for printing 'NO' or 'YES' remain unchanged from the initial state.
