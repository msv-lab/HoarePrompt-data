Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is increased by `x`, and if `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by the value of `x`. The values of `n` and `x` remain as per the postcondition given in the initial state. The condition involving `s`, `k`, and `x` also remains the same.
