Postcondition: `right` is equal to `n`, `left` remains 0, `tleftZero` is adjusted such that if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `tleftZero` remains unchanged; otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, and `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0. The condition `left != 0` is false.
