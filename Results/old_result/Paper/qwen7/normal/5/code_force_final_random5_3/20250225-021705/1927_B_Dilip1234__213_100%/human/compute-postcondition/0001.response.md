Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `char_count` with 26 zeros using the expression `[0] * 26`. This list is used to count the occurrences of each character (from 'a' to 'z'). The values of `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
