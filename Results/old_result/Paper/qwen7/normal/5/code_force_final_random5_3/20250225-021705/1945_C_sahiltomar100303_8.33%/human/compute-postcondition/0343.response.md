Output State: **`i` is 2; `mid` is a positive integer greater than 1; `leftZero` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `leftZero` was not specified, but since it is not defined before this line, we assume it is initialized to 0. After executing `leftZero += 1`, the value of `leftZero` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
