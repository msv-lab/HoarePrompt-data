Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Coordinate Collection**: It collects the coordinates of the four corners of the square into a list `coord`.
3. **Sorting Coordinates**: The coordinates are sorted, which helps in identifying the pairs of opposite corners of the square.
4. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between the first and second points (`p1`) and the third and fourth points (`p2`). Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, these distances should be equal and represent the side length squared of the square.
5. **Area Calculation**: The area is calculated as the product of the square roots of these distances, which is correct for finding the area of the square.
6. **Output**: The area is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct. However, there are a couple of minor issues in the code that could be improved for clarity and correctness:

- The sorting step might not be necessary if we directly compare the differences in coordinates to identify the pairs of opposite corners.
- The current implementation assumes that the first two points and the last two points are the pairs of opposite corners, which might not always be true without proper sorting.

Despite these potential improvements, the core logic of calculating the area based on the distances between the points is sound.

Correctness: **True**
