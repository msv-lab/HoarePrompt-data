State: **`i` is 32, `j` must be between 0 and 31 inclusive**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `j` is initialized to 0 in the `range(32)` function call, and it will iterate from 0 to 31 (inclusive).
- The initial value of `i` is 32, which does not affect the loop's execution since `j` is the loop variable.
- Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the range of values `j` can take, which is from 0 to 31 inclusive.
