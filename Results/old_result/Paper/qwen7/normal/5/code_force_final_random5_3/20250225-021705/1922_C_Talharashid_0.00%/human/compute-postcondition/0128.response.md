Output State: **`start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `i` is 0, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`**.

The code assigns the value of `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` to the variable `s2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
