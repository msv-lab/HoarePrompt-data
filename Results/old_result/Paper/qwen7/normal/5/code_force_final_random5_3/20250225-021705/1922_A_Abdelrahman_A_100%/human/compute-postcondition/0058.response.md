Output State: **`counter` is incremented by 1, `no` is set to False.**

Explanation: The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement (`if x is not present in both a[counter] and b[counter]`) and setting `no` to False remains unchanged, meaning `no` is still set to False after the increment.
