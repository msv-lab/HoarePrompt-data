Output State: **`t` is 5, `m` is 1, `x` is 3, `n` is an input integer divided by 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `x` is (n + 1) // 2, `n` is now `n` // 2.**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the quotient (integer division) back to `n`. Since `n` was initially an input integer divided by 2, after the operation, `n` is now `n` // 2. All other variables (`t`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `s`) remain unchanged.
