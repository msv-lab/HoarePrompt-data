Output State: **A dictionary named `frequency_table` where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and the value for each key is the minimum value between the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`. All other keys in `frequency_table` will not exist if they were not present in `arr`.**

This means that after processing the list `arr` through the loop, the `frequency_table` dictionary will contain entries for each unique number found in `arr`. The value associated with each key (number) will be the lesser of the number's count in `arr` and the value of `k`. If a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be set to `k`. Numbers that do not appear in `arr` will not have entries in `frequency_table`.
