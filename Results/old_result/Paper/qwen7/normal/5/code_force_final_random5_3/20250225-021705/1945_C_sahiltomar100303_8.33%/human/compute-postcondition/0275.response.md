Postcondition: `right` is less than `n` and incremented by 1; `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\) and either increased by 1 or remains unchanged; `tleftOne` is equal to \((\text{right} + 1) // 2 + 1\) or remains unchanged; `trightOne` is equal to \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\) and `trightZero` is decreased by 1 or remains unchanged.
