Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1; `t` is an input integer increased by 1; `ans` is a list containing the function `max`.**

The code appends the `max` function to the list `ans`. Since no initial value for `ans` was given, it is assumed to be an empty list before the code execution. After executing `ans.append(max)`, `ans` contains the `max` function. The values of `x` and `t` remain unchanged.
