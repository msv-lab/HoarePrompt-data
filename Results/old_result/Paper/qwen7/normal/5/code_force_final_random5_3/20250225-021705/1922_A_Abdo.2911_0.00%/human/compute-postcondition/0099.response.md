Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `match_c` is False**

The code `match_c = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `match_c`. This does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, the initial conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `match_c` is set to `False`.
