Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1**

The code `j = 1` simply reassigns the value of `j` to 1. Since `j` was already 1 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
