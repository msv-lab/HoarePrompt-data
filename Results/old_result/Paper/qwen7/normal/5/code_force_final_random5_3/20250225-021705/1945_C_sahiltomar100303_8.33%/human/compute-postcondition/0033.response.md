Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is greater than 1, `leftOne` is 3, `leftZero` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` was initially set to 2 based on the condition that if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 2, otherwise `leftOne` is set to 2. Since the code increments `leftOne` by 1 (`leftOne += 1`), the new value of `leftOne` becomes 3. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
