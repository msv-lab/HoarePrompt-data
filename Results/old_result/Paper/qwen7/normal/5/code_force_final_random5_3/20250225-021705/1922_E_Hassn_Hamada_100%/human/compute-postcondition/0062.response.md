Output State: **`i` is 1, `size - overlap` is 12, `sequence` contains the value `overlap`, and `sequence` now also contains the value `i + overlap`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + overlap` to the list `sequence`. Given that `i` is 1 and `overlap` is already in `sequence`, the new value appended to `sequence` is `1 + overlap`. The other variables remain unchanged.
