Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `num` and the list `N`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `N`. For each iteration, `num` takes on the value of the current element in the list.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `N` is a non-empty list.
   - `cur` is equal to `num`.
   - `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is taken from the list `N`, the next value of `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.
   - The list `N` remains the same as it is being iterated over.
   - The variable `cur` will take the value of the next element in the list `N`.
   - `M[cur]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - The condition for breaking the internal loop or if statement will be checked with the new value of `num`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `N` remains the same.
   - `cur` will be the next element in the list `N`.
   - `M[cur]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - The condition for breaking the internal loop or if statement will be checked with the new value of `num`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`N` is a non-empty list, `cur` is the next element in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, and if `num` (the next element in `N`) is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`.**
