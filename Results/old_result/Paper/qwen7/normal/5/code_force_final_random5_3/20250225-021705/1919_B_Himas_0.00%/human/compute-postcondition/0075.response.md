Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. The function returns either a specific value or an error message based on the conditions provided.**

This means the function processes a set of inputs indirectly through implied parameters (`t`, `n`, and `s`) and returns a result or an error message based on the given constraints and the content of the string `s`.
