Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus 1 or remains the same, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` (if `s[left - 1] != '0'`), and `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. Depending on whether `s[left - 1] == '0'` or not, either `rightZero` increases by 1 or `leftZero` decreases by 1, while other conditions remain consistent across both branches of the if-else statement.
