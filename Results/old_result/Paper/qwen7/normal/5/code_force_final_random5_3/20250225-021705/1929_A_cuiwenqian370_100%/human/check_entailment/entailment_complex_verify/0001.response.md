### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is calculated as \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To maximize the beauty, the smallest element should be placed at the beginning and the largest element at the end of the array. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function sorts the array, ensuring that the smallest and largest elements are at the beginning and end, respectively.
   - The loop then calculates the beauty as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array guarantees that the differences are maximized because the smallest and largest elements are adjacent, leading to the largest possible differences.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input format and processes each test case independently.
   - The use of `sys.stdin.read` allows efficient reading of large inputs, and the slicing of the input string to extract the necessary data for each test case is correct.

### Verification

- **Sorting and Calculation**:
  - The sorting in `func_1` ensures that the smallest and largest elements are placed at the appropriate positions.
  - The calculation of beauty using sorted elements is correct.

- **Input Handling**:
  - `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case independently.
  - It uses the sorted array to calculate the beauty for each test case.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the beauty as described. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
