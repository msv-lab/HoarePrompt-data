Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is an input from the user.
- `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each element in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each element in the list `a`.

Additionally, the following conditions are met:
- The first element of `a` contains at least two different characters, or the last element of `a` contains at least two different characters, or both the first and last elements of `a` contain only one character but are the same.
- The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1.
- The length of the set of characters in `last_row` is 1.
- `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

Given these conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
