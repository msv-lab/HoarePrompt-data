Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`, and either `tleftZero` or `trightOne` must meet the condition `(tleftZero < (right) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right) // 2)`. In both cases (whether `s[right] == '0'` or not), `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted: `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[right] == '0'`, and `trightOne` is decremented by 1 regardless of the value of `s[right]`**.

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since `right` was initially incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`, the new condition for `right` is that it is now incremented by 1 and is still less than `n`. The conditions involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain the same, meaning either one of them must satisfy the given inequality, and the adjustments to these variables based on the value of `s[right]` also remain unchanged.
