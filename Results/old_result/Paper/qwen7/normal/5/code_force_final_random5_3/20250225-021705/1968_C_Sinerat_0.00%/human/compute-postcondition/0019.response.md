Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n` in the `range` function.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The initial value of `i` is not specified in the given state, but it should start from 1 based on the loop definition (`range(1, n)`).
   - The initial value of `n` is given as an input integer greater than 1.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(1, n)`, meaning `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n-1`.
   - Since `i` starts from 1, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` starts from 1 and that `n` is greater than 1 (since `n` is already stated to be greater than 1).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1**
