Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted, but this is not sufficient. It fails to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts as described.

For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. This array cannot be made non-decreasing by any number of splits and swaps. However, `func_1` would incorrectly return `'Yes'` because the array is not entirely out of order.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to check if the maximum value in the prefix is less than or equal to the minimum value in the suffix for all possible splits. The provided solution does not perform this check.
