Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether an array can be sorted using the specified operation. Here are some key problems:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input**: The program reads the entire input into a list `b` but does not use this list. Instead, it processes each test case inside the `func_1` function and appends a result to `b`. However, `b` is never used after initialization, and the results are printed directly without being stored.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits**: The logic for splitting digits and checking if the array can be sorted is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the new elements (digits) need to be inserted back into the array in the correct positions to ensure the array remains sorted.

3. **Missing Sorting Check**: After processing the array, the program checks if the modified array `c` is sorted. However, this check alone is not sufficient. The program needs to ensure that the array can be transformed into a sorted array through the specified operations, not just that the final state is sorted.

4. **Incorrect Use of Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, and `n` are used in a way that does not correctly track the state of the array during the transformation process. This makes it difficult to determine if the array can be sorted.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

- For the first test case `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should correctly determine that it can be sorted to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
- For the second test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' because it does not correctly handle the insertion of digits to maintain the sorted order.
- For the third test case `[0, 0]`, the program correctly prints 'YES'.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
