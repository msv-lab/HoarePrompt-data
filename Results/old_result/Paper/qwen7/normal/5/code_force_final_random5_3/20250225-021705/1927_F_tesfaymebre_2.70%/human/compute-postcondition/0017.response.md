Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `nei` appended to it, the color of the vertex `curr` is now 1, `nei` is an integer representing a valid neighbor of `curr` that meets the conditions `colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`, `res` is the result returned by the dfs function call.**

Explanation: The line `res = dfs(nei, curr, path)` calls the `dfs` function with `nei` as the new current vertex, `curr` as the parent, and `path` as the current path. The result of this function call is stored in `res`. The values of `curr`, `parent`, `path`, and `nei` remain unchanged from their previous values, but `res` is updated to hold the return value of the `dfs` function.
