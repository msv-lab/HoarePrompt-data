Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers created from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element into an integer before storing them in the list `list0`. The variables `T`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
