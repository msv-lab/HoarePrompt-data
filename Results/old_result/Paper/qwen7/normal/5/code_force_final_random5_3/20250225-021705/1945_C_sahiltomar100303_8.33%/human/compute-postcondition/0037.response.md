Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `mid - 1`, `leftZero` will be equal to `2 * mid` (since each '0' increments `leftZero` by 2 for every occurrence), and `leftOne` will be equal to `2 * (number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`) (since each '1' sets `leftOne` to 2 and increments it by 2 for every subsequent occurrence).**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than `mid`. The variable `leftZero` will be twice the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of the string `s`. The variable `leftOne` will be twice the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of the string `s`, with the initial setting to 2 for the first '1'.
