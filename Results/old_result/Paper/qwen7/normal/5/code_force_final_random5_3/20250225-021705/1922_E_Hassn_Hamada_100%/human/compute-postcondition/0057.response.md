Output State: `size_overlap` is (12, 0), `number` is at least 128, `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` is 0, `size` is 12, and `value` is 1022.

This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `size_overlap` will be set to (12, 0) because the loop continues to increment `size` until it reaches its maximum possible value given the constraints, which in this case is 12 when `i` is 0 and `number` is at least 128. The `value` calculated during the final iteration is 1022, and since `i` is now 0, no further changes occur to `size_overlap`.
