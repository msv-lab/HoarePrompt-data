Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the original string `a` and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a`, `n` is the length of `c`. If there exists an index `i` greater than 0 where `a[i] > 10`, then `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `c` either contains the value of `a[i]` or has an additional element which is the same as the element at index `i` in `a`; `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`, and `n` is either incremented by 1 or `n + 2` depending on whether `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, then `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10, and `c` contains the value of `a[i]` with `n` being `n + 1` or `[x]` with `n` being `n + 2` depending on whether `y` is less than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `n` is incremented by 1 and `c` contains the value of `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a`, and `n` is incremented by either 1 or 2. If `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, then `c` has an additional element determined by the last digit of `a[i]` and the integer part of `a[i] / 10`, and `n` is incremented by 1 or 2 based on the relationship between `y` (integer part of `a[i] / 10`) and `c[n - 1]`. If `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10`, then `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer value of `a[i]` divided by 10, and `n` is incremented by 1 or 2 based on whether `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If neither condition is met, `n` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is an integer equal to `a[1]` divided by 10, `c` is a list containing either two or three elements (depending on the condition `y <= x`), and `n` is either `n + 1` or `n + 2`. If `i` is 2, then `c` contains the element `a[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
