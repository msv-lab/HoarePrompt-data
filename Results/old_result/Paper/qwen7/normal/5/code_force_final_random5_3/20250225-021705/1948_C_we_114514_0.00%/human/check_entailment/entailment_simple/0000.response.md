Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case, extracting the necessary information about the grid (number of columns `n` and the directions of the arrows in both rows).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program initializes two boolean flags, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`, to track whether the robot can still be in the first row or has moved to the second row, respectively.

3. **Movement Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each column `j` of the grid.
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`), it checks the direction of the arrow in the current cell (`row1[j]`).
     - If the arrow points right (`>`), the robot moves to the next column. If it reaches the last column, it means the robot can move to the second row, setting `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If the arrow points left (`<`), the robot cannot stay in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`. If the robot can move to the second row from the current position (`j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`), `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`.
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`), it checks the direction of the arrow in the current cell (`row2[j]`).
     - If the arrow points right (`>`), the robot moves to the next column. If it reaches the last column, it means the robot can stay in the second row, setting `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

4. **Result Determination**: After processing all columns for a test case, the program appends 'YES' to the results if the robot can reach the second row at the end of the grid, otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
