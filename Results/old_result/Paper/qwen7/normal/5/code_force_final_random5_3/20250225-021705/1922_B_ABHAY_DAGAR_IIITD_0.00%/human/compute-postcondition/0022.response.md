Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique element from `num_list` is a key, and the corresponding value for each key is the count of how many times that element appeared in `num_list`. `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, and `_` must be greater than 0; res is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `res` is initialized to 0. All other variables retain their states from the end of the loop, including `num_of_lens` containing the counts of each unique element from `num_list`, `test_cases` remaining a list of tuples, `results` remaining an empty list, `num_list` becoming an empty list, `n` being an input integer, and `_` being greater than 0.
