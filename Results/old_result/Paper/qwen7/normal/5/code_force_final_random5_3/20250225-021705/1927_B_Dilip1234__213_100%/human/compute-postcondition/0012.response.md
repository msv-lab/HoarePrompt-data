Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 2; `n` is a positive integer; `s` is 'ba'; `char_count[2]` is equal to 2**

Explanation: The code `char_count[j] += 1` increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, `char_count[2]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `char_count[1]` was equal to 1, but since `j` is 2, `char_count[2]` is updated to 1 + 1 = 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
