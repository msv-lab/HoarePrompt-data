Output State: **`i` is 31, `j` is 0, and `suf[j][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value at `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0 and initially `suf[j][0]` is 0 (as per the initial state), after executing `suf[j][0] += 1`, the value of `suf[j][0]` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
