You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #State: Output State: The final value of `s` is calculated as the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`, plus additional terms for each subsequent iteration up to `i = k-1`. Specifically, for each iteration from `i = k` to `i = k-1`, the term `c * (i + m) * c * (i + m) * (m - (i - k + 1)) + c * a * m` is added to `s`. Here, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `a` is the cumulative sum of `f` for all edges, `M` is \(10^9 + 7\), and `k` is the total number of iterations of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `s` accumulates the contributions from each edge `f` and the combinatorial terms based on the number of iterations and the modular multiplicative inverse `c`. The final value of `s` is then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, m, and k, along with m pairs of integers a_i and b_i, and an integer f_i. It calculates a value s based on the given inputs and a modular multiplicative inverse c, and prints the result of s modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The final value of s is derived from a combination of combinatorial terms and the cumulative sum of f_i values, ensuring all calculations are performed under modular arithmetic.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the contribution of each friendship value to the expected sum.

### Analysis:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs `(n * (n - 1) // 2)` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It then incorrectly uses this value `c` in the calculation of the expected sum without properly accounting for the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship values over excursions.

2. **Missing Probabilistic Considerations:**
   - For each excursion, the probability of choosing a specific pair is not correctly handled. The program assumes a uniform distribution but does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a chosen pair increases over time.
   - The program should consider the probability of choosing a pair for each excursion and how this affects the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

3. **Incorrect Summation:**
   - The program sums the initial friendship values and multiplies by the modular multiplicative inverse, which does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.
   - The expected value should take into account the increasing friendship values over the k excursions, which the current implementation fails to do.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 10
```
- There are 2 children, 1 pair of friends with a friendship value of 10.
- The teacher goes on 1 excursion.
- The correct expected value should be 10 because the friendship value will definitely increase by 1 during the excursion, making it 11, and the expected value is 11.

However, the program will output 0, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
