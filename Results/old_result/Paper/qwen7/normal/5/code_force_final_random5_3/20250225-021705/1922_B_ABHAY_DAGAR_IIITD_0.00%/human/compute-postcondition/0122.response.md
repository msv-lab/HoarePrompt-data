Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in num_list:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `num_list`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: For each `x` in `num_list`, the loop body is executed. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `num_list`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **`x`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the last element processed from `num_list`.
   - **`num_list`**: Since `x` was taken from `num_list`, the next iteration will take the next element from `num_list`.

Given the postconditions and the loop structure, here are the adjustments needed:

- `x` will be the next element from `num_list`.
- `num_list` will be the remaining elements of `num_list` after removing the last processed element.

Since `num_list` is a list of integers and it is non-empty, and given that `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one entry, the next element `x` can be any integer from `num_list`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `x` is the next element from `num_list`.
- `num_list` is the list without the last processed element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the next element from `num_list`, `num_list` is the list without the last processed element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one entry where the key is `x` and the value is 1, and `x` is an element of `num_list`. If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry with key `x` and value 1 is added to `num_of_lens`.**
