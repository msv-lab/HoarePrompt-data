Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value, `trightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `right` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `mid` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the input string, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `leftZero` was 0, so now it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
