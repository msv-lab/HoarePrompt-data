### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - To maximize this, we need to place the smallest element at the start and the largest element at the end of the array.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - By sorting the array, we ensure that the smallest element is at the beginning and the largest element is at the end, maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are placed at the beginning and end, respectively.
   - The loop then calculates the beauty correctly.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a specific format and processing each test case separately.
   - The final state of the program is that all results are printed, and the `data` list is fully consumed.

### Verification

- **Sorting and Calculation**:
  - The sorting in `func_1` ensures that the smallest and largest elements are placed at the appropriate positions.
  - The calculation of beauty using sorted elements is correct.

- **Input Handling**:
  - `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case independently.
  - It uses the sorted array to calculate the beauty for each test case.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the beauty as described.

**Final: True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
