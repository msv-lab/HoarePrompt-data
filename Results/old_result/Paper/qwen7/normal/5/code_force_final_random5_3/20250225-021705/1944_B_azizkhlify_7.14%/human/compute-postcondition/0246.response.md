Output State: **`a` is an array that includes at least the elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`, `n` must be less than or equal to 5, `i` is `n + 2`, `ur` is increased by 2, and we increase `ur` by 2.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increases the value of `ur` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
