Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. **Conditions Check**:
   - It checks if `n >= m`, which ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes.
   - It also checks if `(n - m)` is even. This condition is necessary because each move either adds or removes exactly one cube, meaning the difference between the initial number of moves (`n`) and the final number of cubes (`m`) must be even.

Given these points, the program accurately determines whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
