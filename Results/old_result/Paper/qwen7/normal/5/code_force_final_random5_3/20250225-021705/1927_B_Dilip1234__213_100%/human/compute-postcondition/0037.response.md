Postcondition: `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `n` is 26, `s` is 'bab...zAb', `char_count[3]` is 28. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `j` is set to 3, `n` remains 26, `s` becomes 'bab...zAb', `char_count[3]` is updated to 28, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`, then no changes are made to the variables.
