Let's reason through the program step by step to determine if it correctly calculates the area of the square given the coordinates of its corners.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates (x, y).

2. **Coordinate Extraction:**
   - It stores these coordinates in a list of lists `a`.
   - It extracts the x-coordinates into a separate list `x`.

3. **Calculating Side Length:**
   - The side length of the square can be determined by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
   - This is because the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, so the side length is simply the distance between the farthest left and right points.

4. **Area Calculation:**
   - The area of the square is calculated as `dx * dx`, where `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
   - Since the square is also aligned with the y-axis, the side length will be the same in both dimensions, ensuring the area calculation is correct.

### Verification:

Given the constraints and the problem statement, this approach should work correctly. Hereâ€™s why:

- The coordinates of the square's corners are given, and since the square is aligned with the axes, the differences in x-coordinates directly give the side length.
- The area of a square is the side length squared, which is exactly what the program does.

### Example Verification:

- For the first test case:
  - Coordinates: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
  - Maximum x-coordinate: 4
  - Minimum x-coordinate: 1
  - Side length: 4 - 1 = 3
  - Area: 3 * 3 = 9

- For the second test case:
  - Coordinates: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
  - Maximum x-coordinate: 1
  - Minimum x-coordinate: -1
  - Side length: 1 - (-1) = 2
  - Area: 2 * 2 = 4

- For the third test case:
  - Coordinates: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
  - Maximum x-coordinate: 45
  - Minimum x-coordinate: 17
  - Side length: 45 - 17 = 28
  - Area: 28 * 28 = 784

The program correctly handles all the examples provided.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the area of the square given the coordinates of its corners. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
