Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not account for the different strategies of Alice and Bob, nor does it properly calculate the MEX of the array `c`.
2. The program sorts the input array `N` and then iterates through it to populate a dictionary `M`. However, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. It does not simulate the game between Alice and Bob and does not ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.
3. The program incorrectly assumes that the MEX can be determined by simply counting the occurrences of each number in the sorted array and then finding the smallest missing number. This approach does not consider the alternating turns of Alice and Bob and their respective strategies.
4. The program does not simulate the game properly, and the final value of `cur` does not reflect the optimal MEX that would result from both players playing optimally.

Given these issues, the annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
