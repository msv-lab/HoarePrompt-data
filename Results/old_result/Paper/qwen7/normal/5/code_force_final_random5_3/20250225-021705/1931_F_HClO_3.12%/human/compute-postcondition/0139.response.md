Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is at least 5.
- `a3` is the first integer from the first input converted to an integer.
- `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to integers.
- The next pair `(a4, l4)` is valid, where `l4` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a4`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement will print the string `'no'` regardless of the values of `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `a4`, and `l4`.

Output: **no**
