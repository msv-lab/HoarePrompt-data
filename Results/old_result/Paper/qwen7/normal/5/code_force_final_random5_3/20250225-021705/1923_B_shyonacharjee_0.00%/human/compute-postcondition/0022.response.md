Output State: **`i` is 1, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is updated to `monsters[1][0]`, `health` is updated to `monsters[1][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `health`, and `success` is False.**

Explanation: The code `time_available = distance` updates the value of `time_available` to be equal to the current value of `distance`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
