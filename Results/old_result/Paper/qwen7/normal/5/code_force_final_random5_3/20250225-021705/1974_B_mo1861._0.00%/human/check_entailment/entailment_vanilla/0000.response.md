Reasoning:
1. **Understand the Problem**: The task is to decode an encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating a sorted string `r` of unique characters from `s` and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding character from the reverse of `r`.
2. **Analyze the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string itself.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`.
   - In `func_1`, a dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in the reverse of `r`. This mapping is done by sorting the unique characters of `b`, and then for each character in the sorted list, it maps it to the character at the corresponding position from the end of the sorted list.
   - Finally, the function iterates through each character in `b`, looks up the corresponding character in `char_map`, and constructs the decoded string `s`.

3. **Check the Logic**:
   - The creation of `char_map` ensures that each character in `b` is correctly mapped to its counterpart in the reverse of `r`.
   - The iteration through `b` and constructing `s` using `char_map` is logically sound and should produce the correct decoded string.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
