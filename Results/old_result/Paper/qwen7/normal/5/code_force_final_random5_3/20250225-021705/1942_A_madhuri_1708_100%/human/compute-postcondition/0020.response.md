Based on the initial state described:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer.
- `k` is the integer obtained from the same line after splitting and converting to integer.
- `s` is the next line of input, with `n` and `k` now holding their respective integer values from the split input.

The print statement simply outputs `-1`.

Output: **-1**
