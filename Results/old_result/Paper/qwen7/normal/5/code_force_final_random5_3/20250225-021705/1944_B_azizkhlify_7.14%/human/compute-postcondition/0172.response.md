Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `n` remains unchanged (though its value is not specified, it does not affect the output of the given print statement)
- `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 4

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` is the third element in the list `a`.

However, the list `a` itself is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]` without knowing the contents of `a`.

Thus, the output will be a string with the third element of `a` repeated twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **a[2] a[2] ** (where `a[2]` is the third element of the list `a`)
