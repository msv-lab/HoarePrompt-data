Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The given code initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. No operations are performed on `res` or `n` within the provided code snippet. Therefore, `res` remains 0, and `n` remains as an input integer. The values of `total_sum` and the combinatorial calculations are not performed because `num_of_lens` is empty.
