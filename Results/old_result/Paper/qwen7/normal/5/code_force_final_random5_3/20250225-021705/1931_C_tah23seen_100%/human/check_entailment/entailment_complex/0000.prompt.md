Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical.
    #
    #This means that the loop continues to increment `i` as long as the current element is equal to the next one, effectively skipping over consecutive duplicates. Once `i` reaches a point where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or it reaches the second last element of the array, the loop stops. At the end, `i` will be at the position right after the last group of consecutive duplicates, or at the end of the array if there were no duplicates. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will eventually reach 0 because the loop decrements `j` by 1 each time it finds that `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`. Since the loop stops when `j` is no longer greater than 0, `j` will be 0 at the end. Also, since the loop only increments `i` when it skips over consecutive duplicates, `i` will always be equal to the length of `arr` because the condition to increment `i` is never met (as the loop only affects `j`). All elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` (which is the entire array) are identical due to the initial condition and the nature of the loop.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between j (which is 0) and i (which is the length of arr), minus 1.
    #State: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` (which is the entire array) are not identical.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1 and j) and 0, where n is the length of the array arr, i is the length of arr, and j is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a non-negative integer. It first processes the list to find the position `i` right after the last group of consecutive duplicates and sets `j` to the last index of the list. If all elements in the list are identical, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `j` (which is 0) and `i` (which is the length of `arr`), minus 1. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (`n - i - 1` and `j`) and 0, where `n` is the length of the array `arr`.
