Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in nums`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `nums`. After each iteration, `i` takes the value of the current element from the list `nums`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `nums` is a non-empty list.
   - `i` is an integer not equal to 0.
   - `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is taken from the list `nums`, after the previous iteration, `i` would be the first element of `nums`.
   - For the loop to continue, `nums` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, `nums` should now be a list with at least one element remaining.
   - `i` will be the next element from `nums` in the next iteration.

Given these points, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time:
- `nums` must be a list with at least one element remaining.
- `i` will be the next element from `nums`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`nums` is a non-empty list with at least one element remaining, `i` is the next element from `nums`**.
