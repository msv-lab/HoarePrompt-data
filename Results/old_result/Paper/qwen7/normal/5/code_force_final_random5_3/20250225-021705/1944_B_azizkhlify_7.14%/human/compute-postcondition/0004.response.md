Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `l` is a list of n zeros, `r` is a list of n zeros.**

The code initializes a new list `r` with `n` zeros. The value of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `l` is still a list of `n` zeros, and now there is an additional list `r` which is also a list of `n` zeros.
