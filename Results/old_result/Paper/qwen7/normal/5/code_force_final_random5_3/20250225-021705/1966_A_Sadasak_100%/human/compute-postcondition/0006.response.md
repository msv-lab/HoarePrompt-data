Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` remains 1. If `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged. If `frequency_table[num]` is not greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` remains 1.**
