Postcondition: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, `start` must be decremented further until it is not equal to 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of all variables after the if-else block executes, considering the condition `start + 1 < len(lst)` and the absence of an else part.
