Output State: **`k` is 0, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is abs(a[i] - c[i]), `t2` is abs(a[0] - c[0])**.

Explanation: The code assigns `t2` the value of `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. Given that `len(a)` is 1, both `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]` simplify to `a[0]` and `c[0]` respectively, assuming `j` is 0 (since `len(a)` and `len(c)` are the same and both are 1). Therefore, `t2` is assigned the value of `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, which is equivalent to `t1`. The values of `k`, `len(a)`, and `t1` remain unchanged.
