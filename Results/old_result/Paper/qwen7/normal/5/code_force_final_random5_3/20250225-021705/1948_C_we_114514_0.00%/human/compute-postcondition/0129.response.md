Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO']
- `reachable_second_row` is True
- `reachable_first_row` is False
- The value of `row2[j]` remains '>' regardless of whether the condition `reachable_second_row` is true or false

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable is `j`.
- The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n - 1`.

### Adjusting States
- The only variable that changes within the loop head is `j`.
- The other variables (`results`, `reachable_second_row`, `reachable_first_row`, and `row2[j]`) are not directly modified by the loop itself but might be affected by the loop body, which is omitted.

Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine if these variables change inside the loop. However, the loop condition is based on `j` iterating through the range `range(n)`.

### New State
At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, if `j` was previously less than `n`, it will now be equal to the previous value of `j` + 1.

Given that `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the new value of `j` will be:

- If `j` was `k` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Since the loop condition is `j < n`, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

### Final State
- `results` remains unchanged.
- `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.
- `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged.
- `row2[j]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, and the value of `row2[j]` remains '>' regardless of whether the condition `reachable_second_row` is true or false, and `j` is `previous_j + 1` where `previous_j` was the value of `j` in the previous iteration.**
