Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is \(i + 1\), but since `i` is not explicitly defined, we only know it is being incremented by 1.
- `s` is an updated input string.
- `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`.
- `b` is the second integer from the split string `s`.

The `print('Alice')` statement simply prints the string "Alice". Since no other variables are involved in this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Alice**
