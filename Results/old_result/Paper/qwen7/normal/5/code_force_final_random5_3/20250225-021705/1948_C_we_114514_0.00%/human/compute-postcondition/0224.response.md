Output State: **`reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n`, `test_case` is empty, `row1` is an empty list, `row2` is an empty list, `results` contains 'YES'**

The code appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially empty, after appending `'YES'`, it now contains `'YES'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
