Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]`
- `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `i` ranges from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order.
2. **State Adjustments**: We need to determine how the state changes for each iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
2. **State Changes**:
   - `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
   - `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- **`i`**: Decreases by 1 in each iteration.
- **`p[i]`**: Updated based on the current `i` and `a[i]`.
- **`mex`**: Updated based on the current `p[i]`.

### Example Iteration
- Suppose at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (where `0 <= k < n-1`).
- For the next iteration, `i` will be `k-1`.

### Updated State
- `p[k-1]` will be set to `mex - a[k-1]`.
- `mex` will be updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[k-1]`.

### Final Answer
State: **`p[k-1]` is equal to `mex - a[k-1]`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[k-1]`**, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

To provide a concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`p[1]` is equal to `mex - a[1]`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[1]`**.

Thus, the general answer is:
State: **`p[i+1]` is equal to `mex - a[i+1]`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i+1]`**.
