You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        line = input('')
        
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        a = [1000]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `t` becomes 0. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0. For each iteration, `n` will be set to the value of an integer input, `i` will reach the value of `n`, and `a` will be a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `i-1` elements from the list `T`. The `result` will be a string containing the cumulative sums separated by spaces for each value of `n` processed during the loop iterations.
    #
    #Since the loop runs until `t` becomes 0, the final state will have `t` as 0, and `result` will contain the cumulative sums for all the `n` values provided by the user during the loop iterations, each separated by spaces and listed sequentially.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and for each test case, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers each between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
