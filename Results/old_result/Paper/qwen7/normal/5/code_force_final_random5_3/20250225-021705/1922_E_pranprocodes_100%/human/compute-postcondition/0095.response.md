Output State: **`x` is an input integer, and `x` must not be equal to 1, and the current value of `x` is even; `ans` is a list containing the function `max`, `max` is decremented by 1.**

The code `max -= 1` decrements the value of `max` by 1. Since `x` and `ans` are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged.
