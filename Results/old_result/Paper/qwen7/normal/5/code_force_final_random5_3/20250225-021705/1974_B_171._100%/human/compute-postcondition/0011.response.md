Output State: **`len_unique` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `len_unique`; for every index `j` in `unique_chars`, `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` is assigned the value of `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]`; `decoded` is a string where each character is mapped according to the `char_map` dictionary.**

Explanation: The code creates a decoded string by joining the mapped characters from the `char_map` dictionary based on the `encoded` string. Since the `char_map` dictionary was previously defined to map each character in `unique_chars` to its corresponding character from the end of the list, the `decoded` string will be a mirrored version of the `encoded` string. The values of `len_unique` and `i` remain unchanged, and the `char_map` dictionary retains its mappings.
