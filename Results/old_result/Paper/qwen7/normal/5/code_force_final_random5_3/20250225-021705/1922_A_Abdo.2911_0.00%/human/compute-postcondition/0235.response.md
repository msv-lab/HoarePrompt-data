Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to `n` at the start of the loop.
   - The variable `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `n` is at least 1 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to `n` at the start of the loop, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other given states**:
   - `match_a_b` being True or False, `match_c` remaining False, `t` being greater than 0, `a` and `b` being stripped input strings, and `c` being a stripped input string, and `template` being an empty list are not directly related to the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
