Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l11` is a list containing all elements of `l1` except `a2`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a3` is the last integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0, `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the second input, `l22` is a list containing all elements of `l2` except `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` that contains all elements of `l2` except for `a1`. Since `a1` is the first integer from the first input, and `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the second input, `l22` will contain all elements of `l2` except for `a1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
