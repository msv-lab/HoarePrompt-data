Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (with the first element removed), `cnt` is a dictionary where each key's value is incremented by 1 if the key exists, otherwise initialized to 1, and for every key x in `cnt`, its value is now `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1 for each key x in `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1` increments the count of each key `x` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. Since the initial state of `cnt` is such that each key's value is incremented by 1 if the key exists, otherwise initialized to 1, this operation will simply ensure that the count for each key is increased by 1. All other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged.
