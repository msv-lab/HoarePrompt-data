Postcondition: `i` is 30, `j` is 31, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31. If the bit at position 31 in `cur` is set to 1, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1 for that specific `j`. Otherwise, `suf[j][1]` remains unchanged and `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1 for that specific `j`.
