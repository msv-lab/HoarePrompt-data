Output State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>'**

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` simply reassigns the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `results`, `j`, and `row2[j]` remain unchanged.
