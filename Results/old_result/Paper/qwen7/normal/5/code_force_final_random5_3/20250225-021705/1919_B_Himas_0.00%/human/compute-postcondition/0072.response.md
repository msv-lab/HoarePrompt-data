Based on the initial state provided:

- `e` is the entire input string.
- `P` is equal to the total number of '+' characters in the string.
- `M` is equal to the total number of characters in the string that are not '+'.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(P - M)
```

To determine what will be printed, let's break it down:

1. `P` is the count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
2. `M` is the count of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

The expression `P - M` calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non '+' characters in the string `e`.

Since `M` includes all characters except the '+' characters, the equation can be rewritten as:
\[ P - ( \text{total length of } e - P ) = 2P - \text{total length of } e \]

However, a simpler way to understand this is that every '+' character contributes positively to `P` but negatively to `M`, effectively canceling out one non '+' character. Therefore, the result of `P - M` will be the negative count of non '+' characters.

Given the above, the output will be the negative count of non '+' characters in the string `e`.

Output: **-(number of non '+' characters in the string e)**
