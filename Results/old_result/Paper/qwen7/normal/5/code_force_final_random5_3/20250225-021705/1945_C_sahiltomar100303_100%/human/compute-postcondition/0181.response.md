`tleftZero` is incremented by 1. Given that `tleftZero` was either 1 or 0 initially, after adding 1, `tleftZero` will now be 2 if it was initially 1, or 1 if it was initially 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value, `trightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1 or 2, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is either 0 or 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `mid` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is either 0 or 1, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 1.**
