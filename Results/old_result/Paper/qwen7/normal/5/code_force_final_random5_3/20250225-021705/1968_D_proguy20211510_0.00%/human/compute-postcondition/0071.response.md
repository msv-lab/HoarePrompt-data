Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 2 or 0, and `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` was either 2 or 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Hence, `i` will be 3 (if it was 2) or 1 (if it was 0).
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
   - `k` remains the same.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 3 or 1, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string**
