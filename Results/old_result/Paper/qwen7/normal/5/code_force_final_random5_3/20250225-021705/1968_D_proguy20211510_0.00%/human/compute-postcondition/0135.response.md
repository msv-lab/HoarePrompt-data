Output State: **`preb` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1] + b[i]`, the second element is `sb + b[i+1]`, and the third element is `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1] + b[i]`; `pres` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `ss + s[i+2]`, and the second element is `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1]`; `sb` is `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1] + b[i]`; `ss` is `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1]`.**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` increments the value of `sb` by `b[i]`. Since `sb` was previously `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1]`, adding `b[i]` updates `sb` to `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1] + b[i]`. The lists `preb` and `pres` remain unchanged as they do not depend on `sb` or `b[i]` directly.
