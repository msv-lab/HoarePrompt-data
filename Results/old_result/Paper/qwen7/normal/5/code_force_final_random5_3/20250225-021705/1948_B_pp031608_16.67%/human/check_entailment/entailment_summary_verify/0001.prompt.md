You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers (`lst`) where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. It checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order and returns a boolean value (`True` if the list is sorted, `False` otherwise).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - It checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and rearranges the array accordingly.
   - After processing the array, it calls `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
   - Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints 'Yes' or 'No'.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the given list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - If the original list matches the sorted version, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Array Manipulation:**
   - The logic for splitting and inserting digits is flawed. The program attempts to split the previous element and insert the digits before and after the current element, but this does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem statement.
   - Specifically, the line `list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)` and `list1.insert(p, a % 10)` do not correctly represent the operation of splitting the digit and inserting it back into the array in the correct positions.

2. **Lack of Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might need to be split multiple times or where the array might already be sorted.
   - There is no mechanism to ensure that the array can be transformed into a sorted array through the allowed operations.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that we can transform the array into a sorted array by repeatedly applying the allowed operation. Here’s a corrected approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Function to split a number into its digits and insert them back into the list
    def split_and_insert(num, index):
        digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
        list1[index:index] = digits
    
    # Apply the operation until the array is sorted or it cannot be sorted
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        for i in range(len(list1)):
            if list1[i] >= 10:
                split_and_insert(list1[i], i)
                break
        else:
            print('No')
            break
```

Given the issues identified in the original program, the provided solution is incorrect. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
