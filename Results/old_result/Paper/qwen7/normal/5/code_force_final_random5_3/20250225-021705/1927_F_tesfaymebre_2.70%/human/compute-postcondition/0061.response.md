Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is the root node of `node_u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `node_v` in the DSU structure after the union operation, the union operation has been performed between `u` and `v` with weight `w`.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` function call unites the sets containing `node_u` and `node_v` in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. After the union, `parent_u` and `parent_v` will both point to the same root node, which is the representative of the combined set. The values of `edges`, `node_u`, `node_v`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` are updated according to the union operation, but the specific new value of `parent_v` depends on the DSU implementation and the current state of the sets.
