Postcondition: `i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `start` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, and `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `mini`, and the current value of `start` is greater than -1.
