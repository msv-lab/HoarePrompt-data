Output State: **`a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is an integer equal to `a[1]` divided by 10, `c` is a list with two elements: `y` and `x`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. Since `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, and `y` is the integer quotient of `a[1]` divided by 10, the list `c` now contains both `y` and `x` as its elements. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
