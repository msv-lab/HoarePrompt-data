You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are digits.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are digits, and `letters` is sorted
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are digits, and `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: The function has returned 'NO' if it found any instance where a character is alphabetic and the next character is a digit. Otherwise, the function has completed all iterations without returning anything, meaning the `password` remains unchanged and no 'NO' was returned.
    #
    #This means that either the function returned 'NO' during one of its iterations (if it found an alphabetic character followed by a digit), or it went through all characters in the `password` without finding such a pair, thus the `password` remains as it was initially, and 'NO' was never returned.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. Here’s a breakdown of how the program handles the conditions:

1. **Password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits**: The program checks the password character by character and separates letters and digits into different lists. This ensures that the password contains only these characters.

2. **No digit that comes after a letter**: The program iterates through the password and checks that no digit follows a letter. If such a sequence is found, it immediately returns "NO".

3. **All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order**: After collecting all digits, the program sorts them and compares the sorted list with the original list of digits. If they do not match, it returns "NO".

4. **All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order**: Similarly, the program sorts the collected letters and compares the sorted list with the original list of letters. If they do not match, it returns "NO".

Given the test cases provided in the example, the program correctly identifies whether the password is strong or not. There are no edge cases or inputs that the program fails to handle according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
