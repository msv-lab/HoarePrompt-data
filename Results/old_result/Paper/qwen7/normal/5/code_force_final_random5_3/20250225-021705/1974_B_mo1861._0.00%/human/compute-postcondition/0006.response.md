Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`.

   - `i`: This is the index of the current element in the enumerated sequence.
   - `c`: This is the element from the sorted set of `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `b` is a list or iterable with at least one unique element.
   - `char_map` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the sorted set of `b`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the index of the current element in the sorted set, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - The new value of `c` will be the next element in the sorted set of `b`.
   - The `char_map` dictionary will be updated based on the new value of `c` and the new value of `i`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `b` remains the same unless the loop modifies it, but since no such modification is mentioned, `b` stays as a list or iterable with at least one unique element.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously `k`, it will now be `k + 1`.
   - `c` will be the next element in the sorted set of `b`.
   - The `char_map` will be updated with the new key-value pair.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
- The new value of `c` will be the next element in the sorted set of `b`.
- The `char_map` will be updated with the new key-value pair where the key is the new `c` and the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - (k + 1) - 1))`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `b` is a list or iterable with at least one unique element; `char_map` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the next element in the sorted set of `b` and the value is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - (i + 1) - 1))`.**

To be more specific, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then:

**State: `b` is a list or iterable with at least one unique element; `char_map` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the next element in the sorted set of `b` and the value is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - (k + 1) - 1))`.**
