Postcondition: `results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the next element from `num_list`, `num_list` is the list without the last processed element, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is `x` and the value is either incremented by 1 if `x` was already present, or set to 1 if `x` was not present before.
