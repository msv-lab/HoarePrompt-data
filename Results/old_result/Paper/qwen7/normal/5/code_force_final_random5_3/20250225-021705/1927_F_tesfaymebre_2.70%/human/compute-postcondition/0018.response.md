Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `nei` appended to it, the color of the vertex `curr` is now 1, `nei` is an integer representing a valid neighbor of `curr` that meets the conditions `colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`, `res` is the result returned by the dfs function call, `set_res` is a set containing the elements of the list `res`.**

The code `set_res = set(res)` creates a set from the list `res` and assigns it to the variable `set_res`. This does not change the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `set_res` which contains the unique elements of `res`.
