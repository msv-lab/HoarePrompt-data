Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` is a list of integers, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its value is the minimum of the count of that integer in `arr` and `k`.

In simpler terms, the final state of `frequency_table` will contain each unique number from `arr` as a key, and its value will be the smallest between the actual count of that number in `arr` and the integer `k`.
