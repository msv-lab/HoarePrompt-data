Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1 minus 1, `a` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the first element which is 500, and `x` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] = 500` sets the first element of the list `a` to 500. All other elements of `a` remain as zeros since the list was initially filled with zeros. The values of `i` and `n` and the list `x` are not affected by this operation.
