Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` contains the value `maxa` (which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`), and `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `s` contains the value `a[ps - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. Given that `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `s` now contains `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
