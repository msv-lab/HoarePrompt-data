Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The Euclidean algorithm is well-known and proven to correctly compute the GCD of two integers.
   - The function does not have any issues and is correct.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The provided explanation for `func_2` is incorrect. The logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem statement and the expected behavior.
   - The problem requires counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not address this requirement. Instead, it seems to be attempting to compute something related to squares and differences, but it does not correctly solve the problem.

Given the discrepancy between the problem requirements and the implementation in `func_2`, the program as written is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
