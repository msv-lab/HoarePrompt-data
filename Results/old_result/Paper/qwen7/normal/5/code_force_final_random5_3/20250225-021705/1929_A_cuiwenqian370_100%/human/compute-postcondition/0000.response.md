Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and the function `func_1(array)` is defined to return an integer representing the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The input reading method is changed to `sys.stdin.read`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or the `array`. It only changes the way input is read from standard input to using `sys.stdin.read`. The function `func_1(array)` remains unchanged and is still expected to return an integer representing the maximum beauty of the array.
