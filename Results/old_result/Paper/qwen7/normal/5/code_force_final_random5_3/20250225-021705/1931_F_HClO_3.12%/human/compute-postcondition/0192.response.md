Output State: **`idx1` is 0 and `idx2` is -1, or `idx1` is -1 and `idx2` is 0, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0; `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, and `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified, the only change is that the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their original values as per the initial state.
