Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user.**

The code `arr = input()` assigns the value of the string input by the user to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
