### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store results.
   - The function `func_1()` correctly reads the size of the array `k` and the array elements.

2. **Processing Logic in `func_1()`**:
   - The function `func_1()` processes each element of the array to check if it is greater than 10 and splits it into its constituent digits if necessary.
   - It maintains a list `c` to store the processed digits and checks if the final list `c` is sorted.
   - If the list `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

3. **Redundant Loop**:
   - The second loop (`for i in range(m):`) in the main part of the program is redundant because it reprocesses the entire list `b` without any meaningful logic after the first loop. This loop can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`, but the second loop is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Issues:
- The second loop (`for i in range(m):`) is redundant and does not serve any purpose. It can be removed.
- The function `func_1()` is correctly implemented and processes each test case as required.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but the second loop is unnecessary and can be removed. Removing this loop will make the code more efficient and clear.

### Corrected Program:
```python
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)
```

### Final Answer:
The original assessment was accurate. The program is correct, and the second loop is indeed unnecessary.

Final: **True**
