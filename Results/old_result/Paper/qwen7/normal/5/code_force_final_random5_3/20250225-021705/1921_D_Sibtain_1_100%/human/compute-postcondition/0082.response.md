Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `k` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
