Reasoning:
The given program consists of two separate functions and does not directly relate to the problem described in the first part of the code. The first part of the code defines a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that processes directories and generates new files based on certain criteria. The second part of the code, which includes the `func_1` function, reads multiple inputs and processes them according to specific conditions.

Given the execution summary, it describes the behavior of the `func_1` function, but the question asks about the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function based on the problem description and the execution summary provided.

Since the execution summary does not provide any information about the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, we need to evaluate the logic of this function based on the problem description alone.

The problem description states that the function should:
1. Get the current directory.
2. List all subdirectories.
3. Check if the subdirectory names are within a specified range.
4. For each subdirectory with a name in the specified range, list all `.html` files.
5. Generate corresponding `.py` files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file.

Let's analyze the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function:

1. It correctly gets the current directory using `os.getcwd()`.
2. It lists all subdirectories using `os.scandir()` and filters them to include only directories.
3. It checks if the subdirectory names are digits and fall within the specified range.
4. It lists all `.html` files in the relevant subdirectories.
5. It prints the number of `.html` files in each subdirectory.
6. It generates corresponding `.py` files for each `.html` file and prints the generated filenames.

Based on the analysis, the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function appears to be logically sound and performs the tasks as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
