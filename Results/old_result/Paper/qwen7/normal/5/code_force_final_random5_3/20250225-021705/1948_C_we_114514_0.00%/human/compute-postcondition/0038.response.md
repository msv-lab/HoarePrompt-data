Output State: **`reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, `j` is less than `n`, and `row2[j]` is greater than '>' unless `j` equals `n` minus 1, in which case `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged and `j` is equal to `n` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code simply sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `reachable_first_row`, `j`, or `row2[j]`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
