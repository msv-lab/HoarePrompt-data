Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is an integer equal to `a[1]` divided by 10, `c` is a list with one more element which is `a[1]`, `n` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = n + 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `y`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `n`.
