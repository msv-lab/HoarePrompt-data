You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: The dictionary `d` will contain keys from 1 to `n` (the length of `s`), and each key `i` will have a value equal to the balance of parentheses up to position `i-1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, the last index processed in the loop. The string `s` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains an empty string.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The dictionary `d` is empty; `i` is `n-1`; `ans` is the original string `s`.
    #
    #Explanation: Since the loop continues as long as there are items in the dictionary `d`, and we know from the output state after 3 iterations that `d` must have at least one item initially, after all iterations, the dictionary `d` will be empty because the loop has processed all its items. The variable `i` starts at `n-1` and gets decremented with each iteration but does not go below 0 (since it's an index), so after all iterations, `i` remains `n-1`. The variable `ans` accumulates the string `s` character by character during each iteration, so by the end of all iterations, `ans` will be the entire string `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the original string `s`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   ```python
   n = input()
   print(func_1(n))
   ```
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
       n = len(s)
       ans = ''
       d = {}
       d[0] = 0
       for i in range(len(s)):
           if s[i] == '(':
               d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
           else:
               d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
       d.pop(n)
       d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
       for (i, j) in d:
           ans += s[i]
       return ans
   ```

   - **Initialization:**
     - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
     - `ans` is initialized as an empty string.
     - `d` is a dictionary where keys are positions (from 1 to `n`) and values are the prefix balances.

   - **Building the Prefix Balance Dictionary:**
     - A loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '(', the balance increases by 1.
     - If the character is ')', the balance decreases by 1.
     - The dictionary `d` is updated with these balances.

   - **Removing the Last Key:**
     - `d.pop(n)` removes the last key-value pair from the dictionary, which corresponds to the full length of the string.

   - **Sorting the Dictionary:**
     - The dictionary items are sorted based on their values (prefix balances).
     - Ties are broken by the keys (positions), but since `d.pop(n)` removes the last entry, there should be no ties.

   - **Constructing the Result String:**
     - A loop iterates over the sorted dictionary items.
     - Characters corresponding to the sorted positions are appended to `ans`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ties in Sorting:**
   - The problem statement specifies that in case of a tie in prefix balance, the positions should be sorted in decreasing order.
   - However, the current implementation sorts only by prefix balance without considering the position.

2. **Missing Position Sorting:**
   - To handle ties correctly, the sorting key should be a tuple `(balance, -position)` instead of just `balance`.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans
```

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation due to the missing consideration of position in case of ties. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
