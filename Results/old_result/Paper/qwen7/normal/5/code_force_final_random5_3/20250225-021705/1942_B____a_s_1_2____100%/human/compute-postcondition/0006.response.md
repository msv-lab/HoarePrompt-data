Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to `n - 1`.
   - The loop runs in reverse order until `i` reaches `-1`.

3. **Initial values before the loop**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`.
   - `mex` is equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will start with `i` set to `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts at `n - 1` and goes down to `-1`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
