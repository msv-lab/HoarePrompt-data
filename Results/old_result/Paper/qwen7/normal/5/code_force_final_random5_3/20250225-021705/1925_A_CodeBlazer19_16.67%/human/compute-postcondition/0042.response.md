Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined by the variables `j` and `k` in the expression `for j in range(97, k + 97):`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range specified by `range(97, k + 97)`. This means `j` must be less than `k + 97`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 199.
   - `k` is at least 102.
   - `s` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value 199 (`}*`).

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `k + 97`.
   - Given `j` is currently 199, we need to ensure that `199 < k + 97`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `j` is 199, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than `199 - 97 = 102`.
   - Therefore, `k` must still be at least 102 (and potentially larger).

6. **Update the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from 199 to 200.
   - `k` must remain at least 102.

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `j` is 200, `k` is at least 102, `s` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value 199 (`}*`)**
