Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Next Year**: The logic used to calculate `next_year` is flawed. Specifically, the line:
   ```python
   next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
   ```
   This calculation does not correctly find the next occurrence of the sign after `last_year`. Instead, it should find the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic should be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods up to the current sign, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence of periods up to the current sign. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = reduce(lcm, a)
        results.append(str(result))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This corrected program uses the `lcm` function to compute the least common multiple of the sequence of periods, which gives the correct year when all signs will occur sequentially.
