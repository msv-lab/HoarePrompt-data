Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, results list contains 'yes', `arr` is updated with the new string input by the user.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('yes')` appends the string `'yes'` to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
