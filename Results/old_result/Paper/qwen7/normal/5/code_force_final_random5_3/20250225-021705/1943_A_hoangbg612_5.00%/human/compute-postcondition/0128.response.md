Output State: **`cur` is -1, `i` is `len(N) - 1`, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The line `cur = -1` changes the value of `cur` to `-1`. The values of `i`, `S`, `T`, and `N` remain unchanged from their initial states.
