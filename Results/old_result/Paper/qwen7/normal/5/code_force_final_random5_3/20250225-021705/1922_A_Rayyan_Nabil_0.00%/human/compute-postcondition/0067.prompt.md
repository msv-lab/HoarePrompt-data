You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the final input string after all iterations, `b` is the final input string after all iterations, `c` is the final input string after all iterations, `l` is 'YES'.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` and increments `i` each time). The variable `l` will be 'YES' if for every index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If there exists any index where both conditions are false (`a[i] == c[i]` and `b[i] == c[i]`), then `l` remains 'NO'. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold their respective final values after all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes variables t, n, a, b, and c, where t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 20 inclusive, and a, b, and c are strings of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
