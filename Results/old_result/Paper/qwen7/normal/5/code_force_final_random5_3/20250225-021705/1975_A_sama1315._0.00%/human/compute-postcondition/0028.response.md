Output State: `index` is 10 + 2*n, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the specified slices of `data` as per the loop's logic, `result` is the last return value of `func_1(arr)` added to the `results` list.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed:
- The variable `index` will be at the position right after the last processed array, specifically 10 plus twice the value of `n`.
- The variable `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more iterations left to perform.
- The `results` list will contain the outputs from `func_1(arr)` for each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `arr` and `result` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, but since the loop has finished, these variables are no longer being updated and can be considered as part of the final state.
