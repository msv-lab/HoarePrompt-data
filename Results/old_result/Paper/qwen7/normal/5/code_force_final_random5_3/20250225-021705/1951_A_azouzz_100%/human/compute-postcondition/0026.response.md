Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 2, `cnt1` remains greater than 2. Otherwise, `cnt1` remains less than or equal to 2, and if `cnt1` is exactly 1, it remains unchanged. If `cnt1` is 0 or 2, it becomes even. If the string `s` contains the substring '11', the count of '1' becomes at least 2.
