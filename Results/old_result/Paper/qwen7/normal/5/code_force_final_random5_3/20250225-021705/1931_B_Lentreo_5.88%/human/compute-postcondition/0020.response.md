Output State: **The final value of `curr` is the sum of all elements in `nums` that are not zero, each adjusted by subtracting the previous element in the list.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `curr` will have accumulated the value of each non-zero element in `nums` minus the previous element in the list. This means if we start from the second element in `nums`, each element (if not zero) is added to `curr` after subtracting the previous element. The process continues until all elements in `nums` have been processed.
