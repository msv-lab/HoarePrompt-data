Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(len(s))`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(s)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `k`.
   - `len(s)` is the length of the list `s`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < len(s)`. Given that `i` is initially `k`, the loop will execute if `k < len(s)`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `i` should be set to `k`.
   - `len(s)` should be the length of the list `s`.

5. **Consider the state of `s`**: Since `s` is a list containing `k` elements, its length is `k`. Therefore, `len(s)` is `k`.

6. **Final state before the loop**:
   - `i` is `k`.
   - `len(s)` is `k`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(s)`.

**State:**
**`i` is `k`, `len(s)` is `k`**
