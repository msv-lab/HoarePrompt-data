Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `x = (n + 1) // 2` assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `x`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, or `m`. The precondition remains unchanged, and only `x` is updated to be `(n + 1) // 2`.
