Output State: **`cur` is equal to `i`, `i` is equal to `cur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `cur` and `i`, but it indicates that we break out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since the initial values of `cur` and `i` are the same, they remain unchanged.
