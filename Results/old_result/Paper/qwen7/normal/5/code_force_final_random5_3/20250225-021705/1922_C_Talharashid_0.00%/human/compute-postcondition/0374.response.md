Postcondition: `i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is 0, `start` is now equal to `len(lst) - 1` and `len(lst)` must be greater than 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`, and if `start - 1` is greater than `-1`, `start` is decremented by 1.
