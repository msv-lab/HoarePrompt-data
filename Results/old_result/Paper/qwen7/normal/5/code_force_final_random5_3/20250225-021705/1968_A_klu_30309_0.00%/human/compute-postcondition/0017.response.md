Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `y` is unchanged, `max_val` is set to `y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `y` to the variable `max_val`. This means that `max_val` now holds the value of `y`, while `x` remains greater than 1 and the condition regarding divisibility is unchanged.
