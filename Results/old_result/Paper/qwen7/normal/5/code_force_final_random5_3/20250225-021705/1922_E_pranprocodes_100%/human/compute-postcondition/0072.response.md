Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an integer except 1, now either halved or equal to the original value minus 1, `max` is 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either 0, -100000000, or 1, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, 99999998 or 99999999.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Since `max` can be either 99999998 or 99999999, the list `ans` will now contain -100000000 (its original value) and either 99999998 or 99999999. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
