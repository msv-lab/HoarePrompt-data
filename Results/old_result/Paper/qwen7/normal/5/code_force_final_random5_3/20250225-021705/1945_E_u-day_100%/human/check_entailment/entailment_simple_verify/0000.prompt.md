You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, n and x are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and p is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n.

def func_3():

    #State: Output State: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n-1`. Since the loop updates `pos` only when it finds an element in `arr` that equals `k`, and given that the loop has completed all iterations, `pos` will be set to the index where `k` was found, or remain 0 if `k` was not found in any of the elements of `arr`. In the provided output states, `pos` is incremented each time the condition `arr[i] == k` is met and the loop has not yet reached its last iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, `pos` will be the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or 0 if `k` does not appear in `arr`. The variable `n` must remain greater than 0, and `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes.

    st = set()

        mid = (low + high) // 2

        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` and `high` are such that `low + 1 < high`, `mid` is added to set `st` multiple times, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` in each iteration until the final search range cannot be further narrowed.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: 2 3
    #State: Postcondition: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` and `high` are such that `low + 1 < high`, `mid` is added to set `st` multiple times, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` in each iteration until the final search range cannot be further narrowed. Additionally, `arr[low]` is either equal to `k` or not equal to `k`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the program uses a binary search approach to find the position of `x` in the permutation `arr`. However, the binary search implementation is flawed because it does not properly handle the case when the middle element is greater than `x` and updates the `low` and `high` pointers incorrectly.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in the `func_3` function is flawed. When `arr[mid] > k`, the code updates `high = mid`, which is incorrect. It should update `low = mid + 1` instead. This error leads to incorrect results when searching for the position of `x`.

2. **Set Usage**: The variable `st` is used to store mid values, but it is not necessary for the binary search and does not affect the outcome of the search. However, its presence does not contribute to the correctness of the binary search logic.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The number 3 should be swapped with the number at position 2 (index 1) to make the permutation `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]` such that `p_l` is equal to 3 after the binary search.

- Actual Output:
  - The program outputs `0`, indicating no swaps are needed, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
