Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(len(pres))`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `len(pres)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `rem` is `k - 1`.
   - `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`.
   - `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(pres)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `len(pres)` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `len(pres)` remains unchanged, but for the loop to continue, it must still be greater than 2.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(pres)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 3, `len(pres)` must be greater than 2**.
