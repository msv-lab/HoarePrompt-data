Output State: **`inc` is -1, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, `s` is the sum of `s` and either `1` or `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` plus `abs(lst[-1] - lst[-2])`, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial state, `d1[start]` is equal to `mini`, `d2[start]` is equal to the sum of `s` and `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state except for the entry at index `-1`, which is now `mini`, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.**

Explanation: The variable `start` is incremented by the value of `inc`, which is -1. Since `start` initially was -1, adding -1 to it results in `start` becoming 0. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
