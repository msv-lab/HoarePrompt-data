Output State: **`leftZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` remains unchanged, `tleftOne` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `mid` is defined, `n` is defined, the current value of `i` is 1 and still less than or equal to `n` and greater than `mid`, `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is 1**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was initially 0 (implied from the context), it becomes 1 after the increment. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
