The loop condition is `start != end`. For the loop to execute at least once, the initial values of `start` and `end` must satisfy this condition.

- `start` is initially set to 0.
- `end` is initially set to `len(lst) - 1`.

Given these initial values, `start` (0) is not equal to `end` (`len(lst) - 1`), so the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.

State: **`start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is the input integer `m`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.**
