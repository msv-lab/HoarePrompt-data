Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i in range(t)`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `m` must be greater than 3
   - `end` is `end - 3`
   - `s` is 0
   - `start` is `start - 3`
   - If `start < end` is true, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.
   - If `start < end` is false, then `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 4.
   - The value of `t` does not change within the loop, so `t` remains the same.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `m` must still be greater than 3.
   - `end` is updated to `end - 3`.
   - `s` remains 0.
   - `start` is updated to `start - 3`.

Given these adjustments, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is `end - 3`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 3`**.
