Output State: **`i` is 3 or 1, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the element `a[pb - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the element `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `i` is either 3 or 1, and `k` retains its integer value from the original string `k`. The list `b` now includes the element `a[pb - 1]`.
