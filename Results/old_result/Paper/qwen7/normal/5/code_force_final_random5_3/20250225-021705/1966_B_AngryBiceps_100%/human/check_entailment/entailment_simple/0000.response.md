Reasoning:
1. The program iterates through each test case using a loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
3. It then reads the grid itself, storing each row in a list `a`.
4. The program constructs `first_row` by taking the first character of each row and `last_row` by taking the last character of each row.
5. The program checks two main conditions:
   - If the first row and the last row are different but both are uniform (all 'W' or all 'B'), it prints 'NO'.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'YES'.

However, there is a flaw in the logic:
- The program only checks the first and last rows for uniformity and difference. This is insufficient because the entire grid needs to be considered.
- The program should check if the entire grid is uniform (either all 'W' or all 'B').

To fix this, the program should check if all elements in the grid are the same after constructing `a`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
        
        # Check if the entire grid is uniform
        if all(row == a[0] for row in a):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# The rest of the code remains the same
```

Given the original program, it fails to correctly determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
