Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, where for each test case, it takes three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) as input. For each set of inputs, it calculates the value of \( \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2 \) and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated values for each test case.**
