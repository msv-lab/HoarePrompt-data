Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`. The only variable being used in this loop is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the `num_of_lens` dictionary.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**: For the loop to execute, the `num_of_lens` dictionary must contain at least one value. This means there must be at least one unique element in `num_list` that appears more than once.

3. **List the Required Adjustments**:
   - `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair (i.e., it must contain at least one unique element from `num_list` and its count).
   - `cnt` will take on the values from `num_of_lens.values()`, so we don't need to explicitly set `cnt` but rather ensure `num_of_lens` has the necessary structure.

Given these points, the required adjustments are:

- `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair.
- `test_cases` is already greater than 0 and will be decremented within the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `test_cases`.
- `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, and `total_count` do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given loop head.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair**.
