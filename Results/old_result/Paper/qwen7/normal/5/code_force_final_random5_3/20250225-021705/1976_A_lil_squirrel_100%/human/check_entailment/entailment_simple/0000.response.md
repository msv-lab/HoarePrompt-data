### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself (`password`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes two lists: `letters` to store all the letters and `digits` to store all the digits from the password.
   - It iterates over each character in the password, appending it to the appropriate list based on whether it is a letter or a digit.
   - After the loop, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted. If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - Next, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted. If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - Then, it checks if there is any digit immediately following a letter in the password. If such a sequence is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - If none of the above conditions trigger a 'NO', it returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the password consists only of letters or only of digits correctly.
   - The function ensures that no digit follows a letter, and all digits and letters are sorted.

4. **State Analysis**:
   - The state analysis provided in the comments accurately reflects the state of the program at various points.
   - The logic flow is clear and follows the problem constraints.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the required conditions for a strong password as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
