Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is 0, rightOne is n//2, rightZero is n, leftOne is n//2, right is n, tleftZero is 0, trightOne is 0, trightZero is 0.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions can be deduced:

- `left` will be 0 because the loop continues to decrement `left` until it reaches 0.
- `leftZero` will be 0 because once `left` reaches 0, no more characters are processed from the left side.
- `rightOne` will be `n//2` because the loop processes the entire string from the midpoint to the end, counting the number of '1's.
- `rightZero` will be `n` because all positions from the midpoint to the end are considered, and initially, `rightZero` starts at 0, but since `right` ends at `n`, `rightZero` will be `n`.
- `leftOne` will be `n//2` because the loop processes the entire string from the midpoint to the beginning, counting the number of '1's.
- `right` will be `n` because the loop processes the entire string from the midpoint to the end.
- `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, and `trightZero` will all be 0 because these variables accumulate counts over the entire process, and by the end, they reflect the final state where no further changes are made.

These values satisfy all the conditions described in the problem statement for the final iteration of the loop.
