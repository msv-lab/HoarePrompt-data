Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `index` is increased by `n + int(data[index]) + 1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the `result` as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`**.

Explanation: The line `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state of `index` is increased by `n + int(data[index]) + 1`.
