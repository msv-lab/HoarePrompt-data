Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace**.

Explanation: The code `c = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from it, and assigns the result to the variable `c`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
