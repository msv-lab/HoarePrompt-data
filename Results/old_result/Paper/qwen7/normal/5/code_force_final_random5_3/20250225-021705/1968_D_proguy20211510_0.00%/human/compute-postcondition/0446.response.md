Output State: `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `ptsb` contains the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres)-1`, `ptss` contains the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + (k - i - 1) * s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres)-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `rem` will be `k - len(pres)`, `i` will be equal to the length of `pres`, `ptsb` will contain the sum of `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(pres)-1`, and `ptss` will contain the sum of `pres[i] + (k - i - 1) * s[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(pres)-1`.
