Output State: **`j` is 0, `c` is an integer, and the value of `(c >> j & 1)` is true; `pre[0][1]` is 1; `suf[0][1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, the code effectively decreases `suf[0][1]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
