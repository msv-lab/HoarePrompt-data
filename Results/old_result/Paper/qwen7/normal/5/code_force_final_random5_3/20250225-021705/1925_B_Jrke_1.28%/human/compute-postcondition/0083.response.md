Output State: **`l` is a list containing `ans`, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 2, and `i` is appended to the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `l`. The initial state of `i` is `previous value of i + 2`. Therefore, `i` is appended to the list `l`. The other variables (`ans` and the previous value of `i`) remain unchanged.
