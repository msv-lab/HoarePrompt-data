Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. The count of '1' in `s` is less than or equal to 2 and it is not even. The string `s` contains the substring '11', and the current value of `cnt1` is at least 2.
