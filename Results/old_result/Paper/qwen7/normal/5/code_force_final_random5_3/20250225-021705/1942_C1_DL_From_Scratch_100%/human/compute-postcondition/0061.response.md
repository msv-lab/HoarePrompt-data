Output State: **`count` is between 0 and `x-1` inclusive, `i` is `x - 1`, `T` is `T - 1`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `count`, `i`, `T`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states.
