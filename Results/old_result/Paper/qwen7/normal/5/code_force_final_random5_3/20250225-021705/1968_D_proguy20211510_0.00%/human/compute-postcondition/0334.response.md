Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` has its original value (either True or False), and `b` has the maximum value of `maxa` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `maxa` to the list `b`. Since `maxa` is a specific value, it is added to `b`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `foundb`, and `founds`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
