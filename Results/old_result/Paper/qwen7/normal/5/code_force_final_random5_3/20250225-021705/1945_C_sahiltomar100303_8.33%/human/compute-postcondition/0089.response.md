Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2` or `n-1`, `left` is `mid-3`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` or `rightOne` is increased by 1 depending on whether `s[mid-3]` is '0' or '1', `rightOne` is increased by 1, and `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[mid-3]` is '0'**.

Explanation: The line `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was previously `mid-2`, after decrementing, it becomes `mid-3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
