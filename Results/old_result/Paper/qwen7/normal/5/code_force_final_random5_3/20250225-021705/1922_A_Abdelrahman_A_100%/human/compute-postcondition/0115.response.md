Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, a, b, and c where t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 20 inclusive, and a, b, and c are strings of exactly n lowercase Latin letters each. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

Based on the constraints, the function seems to process multiple inputs but does not return anything specific from the provided information.
