Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is a positive integer, `leftZero` is 3, if the first character of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2. Otherwise, the first character of `s` is not '0' and `leftOne` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `i`, `mid`, and the condition related to `s` remain unchanged.
