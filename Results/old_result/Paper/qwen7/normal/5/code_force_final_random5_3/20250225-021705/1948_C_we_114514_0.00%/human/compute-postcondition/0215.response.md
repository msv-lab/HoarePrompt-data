Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, j is equal to n - 1**

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. Since the initial condition was that `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `row1[j]` is '>', and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, setting `reachable_second_row` to `True` does not change these conditions. Therefore, `reachable_second_row` remains `True` and `j` stays at `n - 1`.
