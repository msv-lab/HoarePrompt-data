Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of coordinates representing the vertices of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The square is defined by four lines of input, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, and there are t test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**

Note: The actual implementation details and logic for determining the vertices of the square are not described here, only the expected input and output behavior.
