Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is the stripped input string from user**.

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `match_c` also remains either True or False as per the initial state.
