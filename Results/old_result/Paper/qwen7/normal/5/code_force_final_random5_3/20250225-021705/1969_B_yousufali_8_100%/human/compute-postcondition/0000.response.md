Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This integer is then assigned to the variable `t`. All other variables remain unchanged and retain their initial state, meaning `t` now holds the number of test cases as an integer.
