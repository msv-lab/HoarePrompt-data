Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop is defined as `for char in expression:`. This means the loop variable is `char` and it iterates over each character in the string `expression`.

2. **Determine the relevant states**: The only variable that changes within the loop head is `char`. However, since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine how `char` changes. Therefore, we focus on the other variables given in the initial state.

3. **Initial state**: 
   - `expression` is a non-empty string.
   - `balance` is 0.
   - `count` is 2.

4. **Loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `expression` to iterate over.

5. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `expression`, at the start of the next iteration, `char` will be the next character in the string.
   - `balance` and `count` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since the body is omitted, they stay as they were.

Given that `expression` is a non-empty string, at the start of the next iteration, `char` will be the next character in `expression`. The other variables (`balance` and `count`) remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`expression` is a non-empty string, `balance` is 0, and `count` is 2**.
