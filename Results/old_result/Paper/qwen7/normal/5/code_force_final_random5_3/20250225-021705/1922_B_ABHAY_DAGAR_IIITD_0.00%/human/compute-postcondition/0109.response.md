Output State: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, and `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means the user will input an integer value for `n`. All other variables (`results`, `res`, `total_count`, `cnt`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values as described in the initial state.
