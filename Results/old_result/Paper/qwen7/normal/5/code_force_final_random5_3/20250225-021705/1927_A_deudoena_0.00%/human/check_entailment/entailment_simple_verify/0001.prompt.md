You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in s is 'B'.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: All iterations of the loop have been executed. `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, or it remains 0 if no 'B' is found. The value of `i` is equal to the length of `inpstr` if the loop completes without finding a 'B'. The other variables (`j`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `ind2`, `inpstr`, `outind`) remain in their initial or unchanged states.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: `i` is 3, `ind2` is 1.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: len(inpstr) - 1 - ind1 (where len(inpstr) is the length of the string inpstr and ind1 is undefined)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white so that all cells become white. This means we need to find the longest sequence of consecutive black cells because painting this segment white will turn all black cells to white.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads a single string `inpstr` from the input, but it does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
   - The code attempts to find the first occurrence of a black cell (`ind1`) and the last occurrence of a black cell (`ind2`).
   - The logic for finding `ind1` and `ind2` is flawed:
     - `ind1` is correctly set to the index of the first black cell.
     - However, `ind2` is incorrectly set to the index of the last black cell, which is calculated as `len(inpstr) - i - 1`. This is incorrect because it should be `len(inpstr) - i - 1 + ind2`, where `ind2` is the index of the last black cell found in the loop.
   - The output is calculated as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`, which is also incorrect because it does not account for the correct positions of `ind1` and `ind2`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find the first and last indices of black cells.
   - The length of the segment to be painted white is then `last_index - first_index + 1`.

Given the above analysis, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
