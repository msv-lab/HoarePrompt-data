Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. Here's why:

1. **Objective Mismatch**: The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score you can get by counting how many numbers appear exactly twice in your hand. However, this does not account for Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score while maximizing hers.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The problem states that Nene will always make moves to maximize her score and minimize yours. The current implementation does not consider Nene's strategic behavior. For example, if you have two cards with the same number, Nene might use that number to block you from scoring points.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Points**: The function returns the count of numbers that appear exactly twice in your hand, which is not the correct approach. Instead, you need to simulate the game to see how many points you can secure under optimal play from both sides.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to simulate the game and consider Nene's optimal strategy. Here’s a high-level approach:

1. **Simulate the Game**: Maintain a count of the numbers on the table and simulate each turn.
2. **Nene's Strategy**: When it's Nene's turn, she should choose a card to place on the table such that it maximizes her score and minimizes your score.
3. **Your Strategy**: You should choose a card to place on the table to maximize your score.

Here’s a more accurate approach in pseudocode:

```python
def simulate_game(a, n):
    # Initialize counts for the numbers on the table
    table_counts = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Function to calculate Nene's optimal move
    def nene_optimal_move(table_counts, a):
        max_points = -1
        best_card = None
        for num in set(a):
            if table_counts[num] == 1:
                points = 1
            else:
                points = 0
            if points > max_points:
                max_points = points
                best_card = num
        return best_card
    
    # Function to calculate your optimal move
    def your_optimal_move(table_counts, a):
        max_points = -1
        best_card = None
        for num in set(a):
            if table_counts[num] == 0:
                points = 1
            else:
                points = 0
            if points > max_points:
                max_points = points
                best_card = num
        return best_card
    
    your_score = 0
    for turn in range(n):
        # Your turn
        your_card = your_optimal_move(table_counts, a)
        table_counts[your_card] += 1
        if table_counts[your_card] == 2:
            your_score += 1
        
        # Nene's turn
        nene_card = nene_optimal_move(table_counts, a)
        table_counts[nene_card] += 1
    
    return your_score

t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = simulate_game(a, n)
    results.append(result)

for res in results:
    print(res)
```

This approach simulates the game step-by-step and considers the optimal moves for both players, ensuring that the solution is correct according to the problem statement.
