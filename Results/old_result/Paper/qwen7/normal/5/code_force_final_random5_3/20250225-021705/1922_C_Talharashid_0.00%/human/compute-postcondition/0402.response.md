Postcondition: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is either 2 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `start` must be at least 1 less than `end`, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is `min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), 11111111).** 

This postcondition summarizes that after the execution of the if-else block, the variables retain their properties as described in the precondition, with the additional detail that if the condition `start + 1 < len(lst)` is true, then `s` is set to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`. If the condition is false, `s` remains either 2 or its original value, which is `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`.
