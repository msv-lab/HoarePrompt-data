Output State: The list `a` will contain `n` elements where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the initial value 500 and the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`. The variable `i` will have the final value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.

In more detail: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have been updated such that `a[0]` starts with the value 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will be the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the user-input list `x`. The variable `i` will have the value `n`, showing that the loop has run through all `n` iterations.
