Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is equal to `c / 2`, and three new integers `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `d`, and the original `c` are unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` have been reassigned to the first, second, and third integers inputted respectively. The division operation to compute `d` remains the same.
