Output State: **`j` is the next character in `inpstr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ind1` is now equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `j` is defined as the next character in `inpstr`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ind1` is set to `i`. After the `break` statement executes, these assignments and the loop/conditional block are exited, but the values of `j`, `i`, and `ind1` remain as they were just before the `break` statement was executed.
