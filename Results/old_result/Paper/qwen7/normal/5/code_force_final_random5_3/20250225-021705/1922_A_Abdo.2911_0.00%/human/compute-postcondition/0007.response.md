Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the given state, but it is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
   - `n` is an input integer.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
4. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**: For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this is not directly related to the loop).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a string input by the user and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `template` is an empty list.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

The final answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
