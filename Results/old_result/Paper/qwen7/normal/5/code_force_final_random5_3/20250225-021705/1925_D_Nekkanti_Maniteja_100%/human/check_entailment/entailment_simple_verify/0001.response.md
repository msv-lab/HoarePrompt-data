### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment was accurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- The friendship value of a non-friend pair remains 0.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\) and calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, denoted as `c`.

2. **Calculating the Modular Inverse:**
   - The line `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` correctly computes the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program initializes `s` and `a` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each of the `m` pairs of friends, reading `u`, `v`, and `f` (where `f` is the friendship value).
   - It adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program enters a loop for `k` excursions.
   - Inside this loop, it updates `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` is incorrect for calculating the expected value. The correct approach would involve calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over `k` excursions.
   - The term `c * a` adds the current sum of friendship values to `s`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the result of `s % M`.

#### Correct Approach:
- For each pair of friends, the expected value of the friendship value after `k` excursions is `k * (k + 1) / 2`.
- Since there are `m` pairs of friends, the total expected value is the sum of these expected values for each pair.
- The correct formula should be:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \right)
  \]
- This can be simplified to:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \frac{k \cdot (k + 1) \cdot m}{2}
  \]

#### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        for i in range(m):
            f = int(input())  # Assuming the input format is u, v, f
            s += f
        expected_value = (k * (k + 1) * m) // 2
        print((expected_value * c) % M)
```

#### Conclusion:
The original program uses an incorrect formula to calculate the expected value. The correct formula should be \(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1) \cdot m}{2}\), and the program should multiply this by the modular inverse `c` and take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
