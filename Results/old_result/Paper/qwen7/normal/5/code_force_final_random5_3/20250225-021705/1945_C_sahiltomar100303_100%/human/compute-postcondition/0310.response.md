Postcondition: `right` will be the maximum index such that the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` still holds, `tleftZero` will be the total count of '0's from index `0` to `right-1`, `trightZero` will be the count of '0's from `right` to the final value of `left`, `trightOne` will be the count of '1's from `right` to the final value of `left`, `tleftOne` will be the total count of '1's from index `0` to `right-1`, `left` will be the last index where the condition was met, `leftMove` will be the number of times `left` was incremented, and `s` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `right` is not equal to `n`, and `left` is not equal to 0. The absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2`.
