You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute for each test case provided by the user until all test cases are processed. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `idx` will be equal to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` for the last test case processed. `nums` will be a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{\text{idx} - 1}\), with the following elements added based on the value of `k` for the last test case:
    #
    #- `k - 2^{\text{idx} - 1}`
    #- `k + 1`
    #- `k + 2^{\text{idx} - 1} + 1`
    #
    #Additionally, the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) will be removed from `nums`. The length of `nums` will be \(\text{idx} + 3\).
    #
    #The loop will print the length of `nums` and then print the elements of `nums` in the order they appear in the list. This process will repeat for each test case, and once all test cases are processed, the final state of `nums` will reflect the last test case's `k` value and the corresponding `idx`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (such that 1 <= t <= 1000), and for each `t`, two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n). The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7. For each test case, the function processes `n` and `k` and returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
