Output State: **`start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `x` is 0**.

Explanation: The code updates `start_year` to the value of `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Since `x` starts at 0, `nums[x]` refers to `nums[0]`. However, the exact value of `nums[0]` is not specified, so we keep it as `nums[0]` in the expression. The value of `x` remains unchanged at 0. All other variables from the initial state remain unaffected.
