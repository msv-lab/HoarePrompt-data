Postcondition: `m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either -1 or `i`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then either `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1, or `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
