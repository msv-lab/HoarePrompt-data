Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an array `a` of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it compares the sum of elements in a specified subarray with a cumulative count related to those elements. If the sum of the subarray is less than the cumulative count or if the query indices are the same, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function ultimately prints the result for each query and does not return any value.**
