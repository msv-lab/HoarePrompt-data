Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` now contains the elements `(k - 1) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, `s` contains the element `(k - 2) * maxa`, `foundb` is True, and the value of `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given that `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `b` now includes both `(k - 1) * maxa` and `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
