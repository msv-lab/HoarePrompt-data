Reasoning:
- The provided function correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- It checks the hour part of the input time and assigns the appropriate 12-hour format and AM/PM indicator.
- The function processes each test case individually and prints the result in the correct format.
- There are no logical errors in the conversion logic, and the function correctly handles all valid 24-hour format times within the specified range.

Correctness: **True**
