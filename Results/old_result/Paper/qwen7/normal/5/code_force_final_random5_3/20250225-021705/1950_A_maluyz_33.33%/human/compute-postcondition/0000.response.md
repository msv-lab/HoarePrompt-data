Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and `t` is now equal to the integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, the new value of `t` will still satisfy this condition. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.
