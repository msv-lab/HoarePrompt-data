Postcondition: `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, and `m` is equal to 4. The current value of `l3` is not equal to a list obtained by taking all elements in `l` except those equal to `a3`.
