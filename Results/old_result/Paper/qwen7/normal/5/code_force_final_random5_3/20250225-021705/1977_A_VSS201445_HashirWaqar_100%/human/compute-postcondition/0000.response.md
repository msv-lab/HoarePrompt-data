Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variable here is the input value that determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This means that `int(input())` will read an integer from the input, and this integer will determine the number of iterations of the loop.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will run based on the input value, the initial state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input value must be within the specified range (1 to 100) for the loop to execute properly.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself, ensuring it falls within the required range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the input value must be within the range 1 to 100 for the loop to execute**. 

In simpler terms, the state should be adjusted to ensure that the input value (which is read as `int(input())`) is within the range 1 to 100.
