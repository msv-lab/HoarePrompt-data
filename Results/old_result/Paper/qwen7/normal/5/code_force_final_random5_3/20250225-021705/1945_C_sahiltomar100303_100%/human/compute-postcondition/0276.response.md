Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 3, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was '0', otherwise it is decreased by 1; `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `trightOne` is decreased by 1 regardless of the value of `s[right-1]`; `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. The conditions for updating `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, and `tleftOne` remain the same as they were before the code execution.
