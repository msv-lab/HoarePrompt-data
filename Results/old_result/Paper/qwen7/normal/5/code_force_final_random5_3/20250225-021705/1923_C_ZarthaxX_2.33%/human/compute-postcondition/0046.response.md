Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are updated to new integer values obtained from input, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 2`. This holds true regardless of whether `l` equals `r` or not since there is no else part and the if part's postcondition applies in all cases.**
