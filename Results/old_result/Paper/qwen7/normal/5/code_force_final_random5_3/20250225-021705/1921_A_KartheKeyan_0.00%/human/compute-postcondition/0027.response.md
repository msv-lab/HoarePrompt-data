Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `i` is 2, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `coord.append((x, y))` appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are input integers, `coord` now contains one tuple `(x, y)`. The values of the other variables (`res`, `n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.
