Output State: **All elements of `arr` have been processed, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `o_l` is the total count of 1s in `arr`, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the total count of 0s in `arr`, `ans` is the position that minimizes the distance to `n/2` while satisfying the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is the minimum absolute difference between `n/2` and any position that meets the conditions, and `z_r` is 0.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `pos` will be equal to the length of the list `arr`, indicating that every element in `arr` has been processed. The counts of 0s (`z_l`) and 1s (`o_l`) in `arr` are updated correctly. The variable `ans` holds the position that is closest to `n/2` and satisfies the given conditions, and `b_d` reflects the smallest such distance found during the loop's execution.
