Output State: `i` is `n`, `last_year` is equal to the result of applying the loop's logic `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]` on the final value of `last_year` after the previous iterations.

To break it down in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The variable `last_year` will hold the final value obtained by repeatedly applying the update rule `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `n-1`. This means `last_year` will be the result of the last application of this rule with `i` being `n-1`.
