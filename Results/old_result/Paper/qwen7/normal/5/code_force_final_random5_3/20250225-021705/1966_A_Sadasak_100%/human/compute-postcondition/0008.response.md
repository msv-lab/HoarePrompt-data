Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `frequency_table[num]` by incrementing it by 1. Given that the initial value of `frequency_table[num]` was 1, after executing the line `frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1`, the value of `frequency_table[num]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
