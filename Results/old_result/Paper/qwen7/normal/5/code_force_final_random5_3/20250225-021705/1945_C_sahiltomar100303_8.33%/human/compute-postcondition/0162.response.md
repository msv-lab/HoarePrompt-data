Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `right` is no longer `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `leftOne` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `rightZero`, `right`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `leftZero` remain unchanged.
