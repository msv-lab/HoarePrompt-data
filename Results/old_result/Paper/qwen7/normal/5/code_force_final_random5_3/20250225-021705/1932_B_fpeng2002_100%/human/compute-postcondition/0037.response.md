Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `start_year` is \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[0] + 1) * \text{nums}[0]\)
- `x` is 0

### Loop Statement
```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `len(nums)`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `x < len(nums)`.

### Current Values
- `x` is currently 0.
- `len(nums)` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented from 0 to 1.
- Therefore, `x` will become 1.

### Adjusted State
- `start_year` remains unchanged because it is determined by the value of `nums[0]` and does not depend on the loop variable `x`.
- `x` will be 1.
- `len(nums)` remains the same.

### Final State
State: **`start_year` is \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[0] + 1) * \text{nums}[0]\), `x` is 1**
