Output State: **All elements in the list except `list[i+2]` are now 0, and `list[i+2]` is now 0, `list[i]` is now 0 (since `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` and `list[i - 1]` is greater than 0), `list[i - 1]` is greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` is now 0.**

Explanation: The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` subtracts twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`. Given that `list[i - 1]` is greater than 0, `list[i]` was originally greater than 1, and thus `list[i]` becomes 0 after the subtraction. The other conditions remain unchanged.
