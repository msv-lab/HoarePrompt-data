Based on the initial state provided, `out` is a list that must have at least two elements. However, the code snippet does not specify the exact values of `t` and `p`. Since these variables are not defined in the initial state, they could be any values. 

Given this information, the print statement will output the string "ELIMINATED" along with the values of `t` and `p`.

Output: **t, p, ELIMINATED**
