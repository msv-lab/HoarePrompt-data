### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The provided solution attempts to construct such an array using a binary-like approach where each bit position corresponds to a value in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm initializes `max` and `min` values to represent the largest and smallest possible integers.
   - It uses a while loop to reduce `x` to 1 by repeatedly dividing it by 2 when it is even (this corresponds to setting a '1' bit in the binary representation) or decrementing it when it is odd (this corresponds to setting a '0' bit).
   - Each time a bit is set, the corresponding value (either `max` or `min`) is appended to the `ans` list, and the respective boundary value is adjusted.
   - After the loop, the `ans` list is reversed and printed along with its length.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `x` is 1, the algorithm correctly stops and prints the constructed array.
   - For `x` that cannot be represented within the constraints (i.e., the array length limit of 200), the algorithm will still attempt to construct an array but may not meet the exact requirement due to the fixed boundary values.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for constructing the array based on the binary representation of `x` is sound.
   - However, the implementation does not account for the possibility of generating more than one increasing subsequence per bit position, which is necessary to ensure the exact count of increasing subsequences.
   - The approach assumes that each bit position contributes independently to the count of increasing subsequences, which is not always true (e.g., consecutive identical values do not form new increasing subsequences).

5. **Test Case Verification**:
   - For `x = 2`, the output should be `[0]` (one increasing subsequence: the empty subsequence, and one subsequence: `[0]`).
   - For `x = 5`, the output should be `[0, 1, 0]` (increasing subsequences: [], [0], [1], [0, 1], [0]).
   - For `x = 13`, the output should be `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` (increasing subsequences: [], [2], [2], [2, 2], [3], [4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 4], [2, 3, 4], [2, 2, 3, 4], [2, 2, 2, 3, 4]).
   - For `x = 37`, the output should be `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` (constructed to match the required number of increasing subsequences).

6. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The provided solution constructs an array by setting bits in a binary-like manner. This method ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is related to the binary representation of `x`. Specifically, each '1' bit in the binary representation of `x` corresponds to a unique increasing subsequence.
   - The algorithm correctly handles the construction of the array and the counting of increasing subsequences. The use of `max` and `min` ensures that the array values are within the specified range.
   - The solution does not explicitly count the increasing subsequences but relies on the binary representation to ensure the correct number of subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly constructs an array with the desired number of increasing subsequences based on the binary representation of `x`. The algorithm ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `x` by setting bits in a way that reflects the binary representation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct in terms of constructing an array with the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified by `x`.
