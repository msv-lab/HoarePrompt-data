Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution constructs a list `nums` which initially contains powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) (since the maximum size of the sequence is 25 and \(2^{24} > 10^9\)).
   - It then finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and adjusts the list accordingly.
   - Specifically, it removes one of these powers of 2 and adds three new elements: `k - 2^{\text{idx} - 1}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{\text{idx} - 1} + 1`.

3. **Verification of Conditions**:
   - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**: By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and adding `k - 2^{\text{idx} - 1}` and `k + 2^{\text{idx} - 1} + 1`, the sequence avoids creating a subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - **All Integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) Can Be Represented**: The remaining elements in `nums` ensure that all integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed as subsequence sums due to the properties of binary representation and the inclusion of `k + 1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases well by ensuring the sequence size remains within the limit of 25 and correctly adjusting the elements to meet the problem requirements.

Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to satisfy both conditions of the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
