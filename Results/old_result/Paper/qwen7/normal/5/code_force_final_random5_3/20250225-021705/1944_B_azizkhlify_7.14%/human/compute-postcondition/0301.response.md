Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `ul` is 2**.

The value of `ul` is incremented by 2, starting from an unspecified initial value (since it's not defined in the initial state). Given no other information about `ul` initially, we assume it starts at 0 for calculation purposes. Therefore, after executing `ul += 2`, `ul` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
