Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it initializes the `last_year` with the first value of the list `a`.
3. It then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` and updates `last_year` according to the rule: `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
4. This rule ensures that `last_year` is the smallest year after `last_year` where the i-th sign can occur.
5. The result for each test case is appended to the `results` list.
6. Finally, the results are printed in the correct format.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the annotations, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
