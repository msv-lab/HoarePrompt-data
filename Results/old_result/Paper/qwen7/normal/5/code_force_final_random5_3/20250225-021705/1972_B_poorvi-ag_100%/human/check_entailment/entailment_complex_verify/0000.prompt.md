You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n consisting only of "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is equal to the total number of inputs provided, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer received, `arr` is the last string input by the user, and the `results` list contains 'yes' or 'no' for each input based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a non-empty list, `i` is the third element in the `results` list, `t` is the length of `results`, `n` is the last integer in `results`, and `arr` is the last string input by the user.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be set to the last element in the `results` list, `t` will be equal to the total number of elements in `results` (which is the length of the list), `n` will be the last integer in the `results` list, and `arr` will be the last string input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` made up of "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if the count of "U" in the string `s` is odd. If the count is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list. The final state of the program is that it has printed the results for all test cases, and the `results` list contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the count of "U" in the corresponding string `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the number of 'U' (up-facing) coins is odd and decides the winner based on this condition. However, this approach is incorrect because the outcome of the game depends on the positions of the coins, not just their counts.

For example, consider the test case `5 UUDUD`. According to the problem description, Alice can choose the first coin, which is up-facing, and flip its adjacent coins, resulting in "DDUU". Then Bob can choose the last coin, making the string "UDD". Alice can then choose the first coin, making the string "UU". Finally, Alice can choose the remaining coin, and the game ends with Bob losing. This scenario shows that the program's logic does not correctly simulate the game.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
