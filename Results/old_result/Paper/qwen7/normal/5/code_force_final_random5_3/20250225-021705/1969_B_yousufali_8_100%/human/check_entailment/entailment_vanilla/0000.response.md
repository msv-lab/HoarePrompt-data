### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string `s` into non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring `s[l:r]` costs `r - l + 1`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code provided consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_2` is the main function that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - `func_1` reads a binary string `s`, and its logic seems to be checking the positions of '1's in the string.

3. **Logic Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The variable `n` counts the number of consecutive '0's encountered.
   - When a '1' is encountered (`s[i] == '1'`), the count `n` is added to `ans` plus 1.
   - This suggests that the function is trying to calculate the cost of moving all '0's to the beginning of the string, but it does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem, we need to identify the breakpoints where '0's and '1's switch places.
   - For each breakpoint, we need to calculate the cost of moving the '0's to the front and the '1's to the back.
   - The total cost is the sum of these individual costs.

5. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the provided code with the given examples:
     - For "10", the output should be 2 (correctly identified).
     - For "0000", the output should be 0 (correctly identified).
     - For "11000", the output should be 6 (not 9, as the provided code does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts).
     - For "101011", the output should be 7 (not 9, as the provided code does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts).
     - For "01101001", the output should be 11 (not 15, as the provided code does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
