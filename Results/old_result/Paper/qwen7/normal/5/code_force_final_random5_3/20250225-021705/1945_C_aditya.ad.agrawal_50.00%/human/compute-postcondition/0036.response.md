Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is 1 if `i` is 0, or `o_r` is 1 if `i` is not 0, and the following conditions hold: `o_r` ≥ (1/2) * (z_r + o_r), `z_l` ≥ (1/2) * (z_l + o_l), and `b_d` is 0; `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions and their initial states.
