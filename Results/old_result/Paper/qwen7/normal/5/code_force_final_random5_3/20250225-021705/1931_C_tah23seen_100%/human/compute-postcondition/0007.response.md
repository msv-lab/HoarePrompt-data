Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is 3
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 1 (which means `j = len(arr) - 1`)
   - `arr[1]` is equal to `arr[2]`

3. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, both parts of the condition must be true.
   - The first part of the condition is `i < len(arr) - 1`.
     - Currently, `i` is 3, and `len(arr) - 1` is `j` (which is `len(arr) - 1`).
     - Since `i` is 3 and `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, the condition `i < j` is true as long as `len(arr) > 4`.
   - The second part of the condition is `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.
     - Currently, `i` is 3, so we need to check `arr[3] == arr[4]`.
     - We don't have information about `arr[3]` and `arr[4]`, but we know that `arr[1] == arr[2]` from the given state.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop executes again, `i` must be less than `j` and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - Since `i` is 3, we need `i` to be less than `j` and `arr[3]` to be equal to `arr[4]`.
   - `i` is already 3, so we need to ensure `j` is greater than 3 and `arr[3]` is equal to `arr[4]`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` should remain 3.
   - `j` must be greater than 3.
   - `arr[3]` must be equal to `arr[4]`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`i` is 3, `j` must be greater than 3, and `arr[3]` must be equal to `arr[4]`**
