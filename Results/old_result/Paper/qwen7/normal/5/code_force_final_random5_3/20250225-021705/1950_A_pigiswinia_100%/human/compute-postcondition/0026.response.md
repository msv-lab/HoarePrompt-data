Output: **NONE**

Explanation:
- The initial state defines that `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(t > 2\). This means `t` can take any integer value between 3 and 1000 inclusive.
- The variable `i` is explicitly defined as 3.
- Variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned values from the input split by spaces. However, since no specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided in the initial state, they remain as placeholders for the actual input values that will be provided at runtime.
- The `print('NONE')` statement directly prints the string `'NONE'` without depending on the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output will always be **NONE**.
