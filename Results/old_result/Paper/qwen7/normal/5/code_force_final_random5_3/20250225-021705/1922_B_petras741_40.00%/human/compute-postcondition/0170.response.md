Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `eta_ln` must be greater than `n + 1`, `res` is increased by `q[eta[n + 1]] * (q[eta[n + 1]] - 1) * (q[eta[n + 1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`**.

Explanation: The value of `rho` is incremented by `q[eta[j]]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta_ln` must be greater than `n + 1`, and `res` is updated by adding a certain value involving `q[eta[n + 1]]` and `q[eta[j]]` to its current value.
