Postcondition: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and t must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split. If the condition `a < b > c` is true, then the condition `a` is not less than `b` and `b` is not less than `c` holds. Otherwise, either `a` is greater than or equal to `b` or `b` is less than `c`.
