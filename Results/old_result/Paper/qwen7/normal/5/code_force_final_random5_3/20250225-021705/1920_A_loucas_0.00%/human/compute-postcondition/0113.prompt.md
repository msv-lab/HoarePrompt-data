Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `x` will be an input integer for each iteration, and `a` will be an integer derived from splitting the input and converting it to an integer. Depending on the value of `x`, `a` will be appended to either the `big` list (if `x` equals 1), the `less` list (if `x` equals 2), or the `no` list (if `x` does not equal 1 or 2). The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will contain all the values of `a` that were appended to them throughout the loop's iterations. The variable `num` will remain 0, `prev_iterable` will be equal to `innerLoop`, and `innerLoop` will still be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `no` is a set of integers. If `i` is not in `no`, we continue without any changes to the variables. If `i` is in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an integer that is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`. If `i` is not in the set `no`, then `i` is equal to `num` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in the set `no`, no specific changes are made to `num` and we do not break out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`; `num` is `i + 1`; `max(big)` is the same; `min(less)` is the same. If `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
