Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template` now contains the value of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `template.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the `template` list. Since `i` is `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is also greater than 1. The value of `i` does not change, and `n` remains unchanged. The `template` list now includes the value of `a[i]`.
