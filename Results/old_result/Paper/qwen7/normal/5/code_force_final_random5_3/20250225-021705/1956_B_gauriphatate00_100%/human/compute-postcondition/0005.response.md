Output State: **`num` is an integer, and it is now in the list `count_a`; `count_a[num]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to `count_a[num]`. This means that `num` is now considered an element of the list `count_a`, and its corresponding value in the dictionary `count_a` is 1. The initial condition that `num` is an integer and was not previously in the list `count_a` is still valid, but now `num` is included in the list `count_a`.
