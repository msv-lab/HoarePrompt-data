Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the size of the array `n` and the array itself. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `i` and `j` to iterate through the array to find the boundaries of the first and last groups of consecutive duplicates.
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` until it finds a change in the sequence, ensuring `i` points right after the last group of consecutive duplicates.
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` until it finds a change in the sequence, ensuring `j` points to the last index of the array.
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost to make all elements equal is flawed:
     - The condition `if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :` checks if the entire array is already uniform. If true, it returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`, which is incorrect because `i` is the length of the array and `j` is 0, making `j - i - 1` negative. This should be corrected to `n - i` or `j + 1`.
     - The else block `return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)` is also incorrect because `i` is the length of the array and `j` is 0, making `min(n - i - 1, j)` always 0. This should be corrected to use the correct values of `i` and `j`.

3. **Return Values**:
   - The function should correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal. Given the logic, the correct formula should be:
     ```python
     if i == 0:
         return 0
     else:
         return min(n - i, j + 1)
     ```
   - This ensures that if the array is already uniform, no cost is needed. Otherwise, the minimum cost is determined by the smallest segment that needs to be changed.

Given these corrections, the original implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
