Postcondition: `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, `o_l` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` is 1, and `b_d` is 0. This is because if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true, then `z_r` is set to 0, `o_l` remains 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` is set to 1, and `b_d` is set to 0. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold regardless of the condition's truth value.
