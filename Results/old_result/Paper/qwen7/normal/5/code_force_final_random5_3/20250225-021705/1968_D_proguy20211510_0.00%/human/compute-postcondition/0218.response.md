Output State: **`founds` is `True`, `foundb` is `True`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and the second element is `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.**

In this step, the variable `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
