Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l11` is a list containing all elements of `l1` except `a2`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a3` is the last integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0, `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the second input, `l22` is a list containing all elements of `l2` except `a1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be greater than or equal to 3

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than or equal to 3

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, input is taken but not stored or used.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
