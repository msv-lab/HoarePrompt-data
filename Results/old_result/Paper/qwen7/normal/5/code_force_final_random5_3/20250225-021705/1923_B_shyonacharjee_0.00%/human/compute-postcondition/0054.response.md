Postcondition: **`success` is True, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `i` is `n-2`, `bullets_needed` is the `health` of the current monster, `position` is the position of the current monster, `health` is the health of the current monster, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is `distance`, `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions, `bullets_needed` is updated to be equal to the `health` of the current monster.**
