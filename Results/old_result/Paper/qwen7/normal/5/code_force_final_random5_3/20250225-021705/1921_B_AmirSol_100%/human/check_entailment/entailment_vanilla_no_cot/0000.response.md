Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (represented by `s1`) to the desired state (represented by `s2`). The function `func_1` computes the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The minimum number of operations is the maximum of these two values because each operation (adding or removing a cat) counts as one day. The logic in the program matches the problem description and constraints, and it will produce the correct output for the given examples.
