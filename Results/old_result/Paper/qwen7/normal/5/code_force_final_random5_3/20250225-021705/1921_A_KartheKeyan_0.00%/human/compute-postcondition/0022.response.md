The loop condition is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is -1. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, `n` must be adjusted to a non-zero value.

Since no specific value is mentioned for `n` to be adjusted to, we can simply set `n` to 1 (or any non-zero value) to ensure the loop executes again.

State: **`n` must be 1, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[ (0, 0), (1, input integer), (x, y), (x, y) ]` sorted, `res` is abs(math.sqrt(1) * math.sqrt((x - (x))^2 + (y - y)^2)), `i` is 2, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0**
