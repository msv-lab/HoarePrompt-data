Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0.
- `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index.
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- `q` is `q - 1`.
- `l` and `r` are updated to the integers input by the user.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
