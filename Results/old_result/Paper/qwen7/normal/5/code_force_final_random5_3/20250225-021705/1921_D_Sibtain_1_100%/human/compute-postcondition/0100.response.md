The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since the initial state includes that the code snippet is part of a loop and the loop has already started, the loop will continue to its next iteration without executing any further statements within the current iteration. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 3
- `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a` plus the max value for the current iteration (which is the fourth iteration)
- list `a` is sorted in descending order

Since the `continue` statement is executed, the current iteration is skipped, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration. The values of `i`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged because no assignments or operations are performed within the current iteration.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a` plus the max value for the current iteration (which is the fourth iteration)**.
