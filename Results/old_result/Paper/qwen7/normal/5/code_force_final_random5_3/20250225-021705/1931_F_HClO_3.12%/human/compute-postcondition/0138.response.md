Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `a3` and `l3`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `(a3, l3)` is a valid pair from the `val` iterable.
   - The postcondition at the end of the previous iteration is that `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the first input converted to int, and `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to int.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over pairs from `val`, the values of `a3` and `l3` will change with each iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, the next pair `(a3, l3)` must be valid and satisfy the condition that `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a3`.

Given these points, let's assume that the next pair in `val` is `(a4, l4)`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `a3` will be replaced by `a4`.
- `l3` will be replaced by `l4`.

Since the loop continues based on the validity of the pair and the condition involving `l3`, we need to ensure that `l4` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a4`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to int, and the next pair `(a4, l4)` is valid where `l4` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a4`**.
