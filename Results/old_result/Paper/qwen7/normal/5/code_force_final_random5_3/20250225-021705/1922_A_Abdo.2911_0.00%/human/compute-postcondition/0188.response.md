Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False; `match_c` is False; the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase letter; the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `template[i]`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `i`, `n`, the current value of `template[i]`, or the current value of `c[i]`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
