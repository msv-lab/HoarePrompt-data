You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())

                ].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = True
        
        for i in range(n):

                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, with the following conditions met:
    #- The variable `t` contains the total number of iterations the loop ran.
    #- For each iteration, `n` is the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    #- After processing all strings, `template` is a list of characters derived from string `a` such that:
    #  - Characters in `template` are either identical to those in `a` or converted to uppercase if they differ from corresponding characters in `b`.
    #  - `match_a_b` is True if the characters in `template` exactly match the characters in `a` when both are considered in lowercase, and also match the characters in `b` when both are considered in lowercase.
    #  - `match_c` is True if the characters in `template` exactly match the characters in `c` when both are considered in lowercase, and False otherwise.
    #- The final output will be 'YES' if `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, and 'NO' otherwise.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the program will check if the processed `template` matches `a` and `b` in a specific way and does not match `c`. If these conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). It returns different outputs for each test case based on the values of `t`, `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
