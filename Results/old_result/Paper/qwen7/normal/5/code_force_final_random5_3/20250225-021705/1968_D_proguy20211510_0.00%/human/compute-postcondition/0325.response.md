State: **`i` must be less than `k`, `k` is an integer**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to `len(pres)`, but this value is not relevant to the condition for the loop to execute. The loop condition checks if `i` is less than `k`.
- Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` must be less than `k`, where `k` is an integer.

The other variables (`rem`, `pb`, `ps`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
