Output State: **`i` is 3 or 1; `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string; `b` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`; `s` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `s`. Given that `i` can be either 3 or 1, and `k` is an integer, the value of `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` will vary depending on the specific values of `i` and `k`. Since `b` is not affected by this line of code, its state remains unchanged. The new element added to `s` is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.
