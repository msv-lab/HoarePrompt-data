Based on the initial state provided:

- `num` remains 0.
- `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`.
- `innerLoop` is greater than 0.
- `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`.

The `print(num)` statement will simply print the value of the variable `num`, which is explicitly stated to be 0.

Output: **0**
