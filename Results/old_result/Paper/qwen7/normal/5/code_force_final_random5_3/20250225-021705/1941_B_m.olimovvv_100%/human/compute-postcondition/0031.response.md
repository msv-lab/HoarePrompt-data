Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`, and `i` is `a - 2`**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is an integer) to the variable `a`. The other variables (`t`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
