Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**: This function iterates through the binary string `s` and counts the occurrences of '0' followed by a '1'. For each such occurrence, it adds `n + 1` to the answer, where `n` is the count of '1's encountered up to the current index. This logic correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string in non-descending order because each '0' followed by a '1' requires at least one cyclic shift to move the '1' to the correct position, and the cost is the length of the substring from the '0' to the '1'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. The state of `t` is maintained correctly, ensuring that the loop continues until all test cases are processed. The function correctly processes each test case and prints the result for each one.

Given the problem statement and the provided functions, both `func_1()` and `func_2()` correctly implement the solution. `func_1()` calculates the minimum cost for a single binary string, and `func_2()` processes multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

Therefore, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
