Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is the first element of `num_list`; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that either has one key-value pair `{x: 1}` or the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element (excluding the first element); `x` is the second element of `num_list`; if `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, its corresponding value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `num_of_lens` is updated with the key-value pair `{x: 1}`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element (excluding the first two elements); `x` is the third element of `num_list`; if `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, its corresponding value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `num_of_lens` is updated with the key-value pair `{x: 1}`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
