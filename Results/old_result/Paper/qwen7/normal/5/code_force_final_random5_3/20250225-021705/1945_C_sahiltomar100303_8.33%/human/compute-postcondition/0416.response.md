Output State: **`left` is `0`, `leftZero` is either `0` or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, and `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`; `right` is `mid`, `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(mid + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`; `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`.**

The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Since `tleftOne` was previously either greater than or equal to `(mid + 1) // 2`, after incrementing, its new value is still greater than or equal to `(mid + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
