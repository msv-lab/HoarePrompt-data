Output State: **`k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is either `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]) - 1` with `j` increased by 1, or `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` with `t2` less than or equal to `t1` and `i` increased by 1; `ans` is increased by `max(t1, t2)`**.

This means that `ans` has been updated by adding the maximum value between `t1` and `t2`. The values of `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `j`, `i`, `a`, and `c` remain as per their initial conditions, except that `t2` might have been adjusted based on the comparison with `t1`, and `i` might have been incremented if necessary.
