Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. Since the input is read and stored in the variable `t`, its value is now known, but the actual values of `x_i` and `y_i` for each test case are not yet determined. The precondition that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area remains valid for each test case, but this information is not directly reflected in the updated state of the variables.
