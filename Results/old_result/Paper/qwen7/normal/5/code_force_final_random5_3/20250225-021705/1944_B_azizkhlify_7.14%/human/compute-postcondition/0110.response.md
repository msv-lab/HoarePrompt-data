Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 1`, `ur` is 2**

The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Given that `ur` was initially not specified, we assume it was 0 (since no initial value was given), so after the operation, `ur` becomes 2. The other variables (`res` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
