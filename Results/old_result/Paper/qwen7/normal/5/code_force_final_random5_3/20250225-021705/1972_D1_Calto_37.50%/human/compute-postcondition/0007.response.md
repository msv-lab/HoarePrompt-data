Output State: **`cnt` is `n + 1`, `i` is 9, `m` must be greater than 3, and `x` is `n - 6`; `y` is 81.**

Explanation: The code `y = i * i` calculates the square of `i` and assigns it to `y`. Given that `i` is 3, `y` becomes `3 * 3`, which is 9. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
