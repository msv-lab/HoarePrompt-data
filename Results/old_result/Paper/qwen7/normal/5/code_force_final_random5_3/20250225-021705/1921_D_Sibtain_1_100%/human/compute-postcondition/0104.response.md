Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `k` and `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `k` is initialized to 0.
   - `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`, which is given as 1.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `len(a)`.
   - Given that `len(a)` is 1, the loop will execute when `k < 1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `k` starts at 0 and the loop will execute as long as `k < 1`, `k` will be incremented within the loop body but will still be 0 at the start of the loop.
   - The length of the list `a` remains unchanged at 1.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `i` and `j` are not part of the loop head, so their values (0 and 1 respectively) do not need to be adjusted.
   - `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration, but since the loop will only execute once (when `k = 0`), `ans` will be updated to the maximum value of the single element in the list `a`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `k` should be 0.
- `len(a)` should be 1.

Since the loop will execute once, we don't need to change the values of `i` and `j`, and `ans` will be updated to the maximum value of the single element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`k` is 0, `len(a)` must be 1**
