Output State: **The program returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr`.**

This means that `sub_summ` is calculated as the sum of the first element (`val_a[0]`) from each tuple in the list `sec_arr`, after the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `sub_summ` is the total sum of these first elements.
