Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer, `k` is the integer obtained from the same line after splitting and converting to integer, and `s` is the next line of input, with `n` and `k` now holding their respective integer values from the split input.**

In this output state, the variable `t` retains its original condition of being an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). The variables `n` and `k` have been updated to hold the integers obtained from splitting and converting the string `s` into a list of strings, and then converting those strings to integers. The variable `s` remains unchanged as the next line of input.
