Output State: **`re` is equal to `k` + 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `ul` is `i + 1`, `k` is `2 * k - (i + 1)`, `res` is a list with the element `a[i]` appended.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. The values of `re`, `i`, `ul`, and `k` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `re` is still equal to `k` + 1, `i` is still `i + 1`, `ul` is still `i + 1`, and `k` is still `2 * k - (i + 1)`. The list `res` now contains the element `a[i]` that was just appended.
