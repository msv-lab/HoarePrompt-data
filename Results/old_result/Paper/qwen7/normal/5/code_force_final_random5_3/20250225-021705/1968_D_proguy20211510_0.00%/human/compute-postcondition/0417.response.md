Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is a list containing the value `ss + s[i]`, `sb` is `sb + b[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i]`, `s` is a non-empty list, `len(s)` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ss` by adding `s[i]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `ss` is now `ss + s[i]`.
