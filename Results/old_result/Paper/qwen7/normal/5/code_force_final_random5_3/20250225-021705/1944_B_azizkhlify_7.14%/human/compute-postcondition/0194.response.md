Postcondition: `i` is 1, `res` contains the value of `a[0]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` and `ul` are set such that the loop can proceed according to the postconditions, `re` is equal to `k`, and the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
