Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `pos` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`
   - `low` is either 0 or `mid`
   - `high` is either `mid` or greater than 1
   - `mid` is added to set `st`
   - `arr[mid]` is either greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head condition involves `low` and `high`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.
   - This means `low` must be less than `high - 1`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `low` can be either 0 or `mid`, and `high` can be either `mid` or greater than 1, we need to ensure that `low` is less than `high - 1`.
   - If `low` is 0, then `high` must be greater than 1 (since `high` can be `mid` or greater than 1).
   - If `low` is `mid`, then `high` must be greater than `mid + 1`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that `low` is less than `high - 1`. Given the current states, this can be achieved by ensuring that `high` is greater than `low + 1`.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `mid` or greater than `low + 1`, `mid` is added to set `st`, and `arr[mid]` is either greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`.**

This ensures that the loop condition `low + 1 < high` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
