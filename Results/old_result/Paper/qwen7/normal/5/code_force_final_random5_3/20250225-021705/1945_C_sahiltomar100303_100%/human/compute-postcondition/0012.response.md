Output State: **`tleftZero` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0.**

The code `trightOne = 0` sets the variable `trightOne` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
