Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0**.

The variable `i` is explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their previous states.
