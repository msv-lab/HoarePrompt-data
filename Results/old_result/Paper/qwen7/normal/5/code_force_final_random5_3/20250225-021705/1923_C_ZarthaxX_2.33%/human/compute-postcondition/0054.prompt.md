You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case contains n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i representing the subarray boundaries.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index.
    #
    #To explain this output state in natural language:
    #After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ones` will still have its first element as 1 and all other elements as 0. This is because the loop updates only `ones[i]` to `ones[i - 1] + 1` if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, but it does not change any other elements in `ones`. The variable `sum` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` minus 1 up to each index. This means that `sum[i]` will be the sum of `nums[0] - 1, nums[1] - 1, ..., nums[i-1] - 1`. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `q` is `q - 3`, `l` and `r` are updated to their final values obtained from the last input, and `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through predefined constraints: a positive integer t, an integer n, an integer q, an array c of length n containing positive integers not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i representing subarray boundaries. For each query, it returns the sum of elements in the subarray from index l_i to r_i.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
