Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines of input for each testcase, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. There are t testcases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and it is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        
        print(dx * dx)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be equal to the number of test cases entered by the user. `a` will be a list containing 4 lists for each test case, where each of these 4 lists contains integers entered by the user. For each test case, `x` will be a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`. The variable `dx` will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x` for each test case. Finally, the loop will print the square of `dx` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four points defining a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It calculates the side length of each square (the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates) and prints the square of this side length for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
