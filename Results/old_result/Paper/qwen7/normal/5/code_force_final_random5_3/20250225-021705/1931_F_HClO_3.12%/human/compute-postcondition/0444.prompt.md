Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `a3` is the first integer from the last input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the last input split, `val` is a list containing four tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, `m` is equal to 4.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is 4 times in this case), `a3` will be the first integer from the last set of inputs provided, `l3` will be a list of the remaining integers from those inputs, `val` will contain a total of 4 tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, and `m` will remain at 4 as it was updated to 4 after the third iteration and no further changes were made to it within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, and `m` is equal to 4. If `l3` is not a list where all elements are not equal to `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, and `m` is equal to 4. If `l3` is not a list where all elements are not equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a3` is the first element of the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the third tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, and `m` is equal to 4. If `l3` is not a list where all elements are not equal to `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
