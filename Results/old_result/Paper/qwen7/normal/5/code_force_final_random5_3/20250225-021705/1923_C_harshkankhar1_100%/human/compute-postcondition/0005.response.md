Output State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2; `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x`.**

This means that the value of `b[i]` is updated to be the previous value of `b[i - 1]` plus the value of `x`, which is determined based on the condition of `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is greater than 1, then `x` is 1; otherwise, `x` is 2.
