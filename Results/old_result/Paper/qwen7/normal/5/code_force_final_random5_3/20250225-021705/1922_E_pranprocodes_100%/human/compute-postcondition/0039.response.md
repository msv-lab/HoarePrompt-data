Output State: `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is now 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing alternating values starting from `max` (99999998) and decreasing by 1 each time until `min` (-99999998).

To understand this, consider the process:
- The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to 1.
- Each iteration appends either `max` or `min` to `ans`, modifies `max` or `min`, and changes `x` based on its parity.
- Eventually, `x` will become 1, which ends the loop.
- The length of `ans` will be `t`, the number of iterations, and it will contain a sequence of alternating `max` and `min` values as described.
