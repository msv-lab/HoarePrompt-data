Output State: **`i` is 3, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 3.
- `rem` is calculated as `k - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 4`.
- The code appends the value of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` to the list `ptsb`. Given `i` is 3, this translates to `preb[3] + (k - 4) * b[3]`.

Since the initial state only provides the value of `i` and the formula for `rem`, and no specific values for `preb`, `b`, or `k` are given, these are kept as they are. The updated state includes the new value added to `ptsb`.
