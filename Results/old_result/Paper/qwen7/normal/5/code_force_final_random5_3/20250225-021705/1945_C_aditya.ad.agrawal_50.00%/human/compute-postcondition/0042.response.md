Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` and `o_r` are updated based on the value of `i`, `z_l` and `o_l` are updated accordingly, `b_d` is 0, `ans` is 3.**

Explanation: The line `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos` (which is 3) to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
