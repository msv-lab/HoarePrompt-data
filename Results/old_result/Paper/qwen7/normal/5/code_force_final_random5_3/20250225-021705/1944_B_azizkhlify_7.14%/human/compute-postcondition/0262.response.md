Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `res`. The values of `re`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `res` and the unchanged variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur`.
