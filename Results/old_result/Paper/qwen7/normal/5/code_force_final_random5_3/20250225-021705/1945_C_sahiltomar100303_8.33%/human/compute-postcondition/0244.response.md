Postcondition: `left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is adjusted based on the condition of `s[left - 1]`, either decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', or remains unchanged if it is not '0'. `rightOne` is increased by 1 regardless of the condition of `s[left - 1]`. `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.
