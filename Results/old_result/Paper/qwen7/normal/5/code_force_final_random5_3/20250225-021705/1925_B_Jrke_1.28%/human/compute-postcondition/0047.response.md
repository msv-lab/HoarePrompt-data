Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- `l` will contain all such divisors.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to k**
