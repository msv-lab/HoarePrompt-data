Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is explicitly given as 0.
- `leftZero` can be either 0 or `n//2`.
- `rightOne` can be either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`.
- `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`.
- `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`.
- `right` is explicitly given as `n`.
- `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2) // 2`.
- `trightZero` is `trightZero`.

The key point here is to determine the value of `left` when the `print(left)` statement is executed. From the initial state, it is explicitly stated that `left` is 0.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0**
