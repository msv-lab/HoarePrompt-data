Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and appends the integer `arr[i]` to this list. Since `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the value of `arr[i]` remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.
