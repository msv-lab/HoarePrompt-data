Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `match_a_b` is updated based on the following conditions: if `template[i].islower()` is true, then `match_a_b` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, if `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If neither condition is met, `match_a_b` remains unchanged.
