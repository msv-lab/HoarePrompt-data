Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `mid` to `n-1` (inclusive). The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `mid + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 1`.
   - If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 2.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `mid + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to `mid + 2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `mid + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 2`.

6. **Consider the Loop Body Effects**:
   - The loop body checks `s[i]` and updates `rightZero` or `rightOne` accordingly. However, since these variables (`rightZero` and `rightOne`) are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted here.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 2`**
