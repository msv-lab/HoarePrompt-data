The function `move` takes two parameters: `obj`, which is a string representing an entity on the field (e.g., a player, a goal, the Quaffle, or a Bludger), and `d`, which is a string indicating the direction of movement (U, D, L, R). The field is represented as a grid of size N x M, where N and M are odd integers between 3 and 99. The initial state of the field is given as a series of lines describing the positions of entities, and the number of steps T is provided. Each step describes an action performed by an entity, and the function must update the positions of entities according to the rules described in the problem statement.
