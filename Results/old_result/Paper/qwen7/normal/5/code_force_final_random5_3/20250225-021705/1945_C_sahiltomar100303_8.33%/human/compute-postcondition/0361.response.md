Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `n` is the upper limit of the range, `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

The code increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `mid`, `n` is the upper limit of the range, and `rightZero` has been increased by 1.
