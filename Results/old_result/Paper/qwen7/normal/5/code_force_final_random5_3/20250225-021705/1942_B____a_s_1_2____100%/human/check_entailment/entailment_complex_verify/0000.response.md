### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to understand why the original assessment is flawed.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
Given an array \( a \) of length \( n \), we need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that for each index \( i \):
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

Where \(\texttt{MEX}\) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating backward through the array and calculating the permutation \( p \) based on the MEX value.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

#### Key Points:
1. **Backward Iteration**: The program iterates backward through the array, which is a good approach because it allows us to update the MEX value as we go.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX value is updated to be the minimum of the current MEX and the calculated value \( \texttt{mex} - a[i] \).
3. **Permutation Construction**: Each element \( p[i] \) is set to \( \texttt{mex} - a[i] \).

#### Correctness of the Program:
Let's verify the correctness with the example provided in the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
A valid permutation \( p \) such as `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.

**Program Execution:**
1. **Initialization**:
   - \( t = 3 \)
   - \( n = 5 \)
   - \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \)
   - \( p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1] \)
   - \( \texttt{mex} = 5 \)

2. **Iteration**:
   - \( i = 4 \):
     - \( p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3 \)
     - \( \texttt{mex} = \min(5, 3) = 3 \)
   - \( i = 3 \):
     - \( p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
     - \( \texttt{mex} = \min(3, 2) = 2 \)
   - \( i = 2 \):
     - \( p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4 \)
     - \( \texttt{mex} = \min(2, 4) = 2 \)
   - \( i = 1 \):
     - \( p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
     - \( \texttt{mex} = \min(2, 1) = 1 \)
   - \( i = 0 \):
     - \( p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
     - \( \texttt{mex} = \min(1, 0) = 0 \)

3. **Final Permutation**:
   - \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \)

Now, let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
- \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 \)
- \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 \)
- \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 \)

All conditions are satisfied, and the program generates a valid permutation.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly constructs a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.
