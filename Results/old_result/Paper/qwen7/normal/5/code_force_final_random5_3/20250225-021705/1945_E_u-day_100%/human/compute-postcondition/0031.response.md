Output State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `mid` or greater than `low + 1`, `mid` is added to set `st`, `arr[mid]` is either greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Since `low` is either 0 or `mid`, and `high` is either `mid` or greater than `low + 1`, `mid` is now updated to `(low + high) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
