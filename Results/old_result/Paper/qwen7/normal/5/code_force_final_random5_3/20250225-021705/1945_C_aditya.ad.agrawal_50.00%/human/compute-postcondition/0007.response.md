Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting each character of `input_string` to its corresponding integer value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`.**

Explanation: The line `z_r = z` assigns the current value of `z` (which is the count of 0s in `arr`) to a new variable `z_r`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
