Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is set such that there are no remaining elements in `data` that can be used to create any more arrays, and `results` list contains exactly `t` elements.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` must still be greater than 0, indicating that there were sufficient elements in the `data` list to complete all iterations. The `index` variable will have been incremented to a point where it has exhausted the available elements in the `data` list, meaning no more arrays can be created. The `results` list will contain exactly `t` elements, each representing the return value of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, with each `array` being a list of integers derived from the `data` list according to the specified slicing.
