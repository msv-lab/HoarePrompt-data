Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `ind2` is 1.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range of `len(inpstr)`.
3. **Current Value of `i`**: Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will check if `i` is less than `len(inpstr)`.
4. **Incrementing `i`**: If the loop continues, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
5. **Condition Check**: For the loop to continue, the condition `i < len(inpstr)` must be true. This means `i` must be less than the length of `inpstr`.

Given that `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be 2 for the next iteration. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `2 < len(inpstr)`.

Since there are no changes to `ind2` unless a specific condition is met inside the loop, and no such condition is mentioned in the problem statement, `ind2` remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is 2, `ind2` is 1**
