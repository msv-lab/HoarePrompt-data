Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The variable `match_a_b` is explicitly set to `False`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
