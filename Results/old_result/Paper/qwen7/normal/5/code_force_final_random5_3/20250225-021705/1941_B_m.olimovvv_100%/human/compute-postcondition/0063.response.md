Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input of space-separated integers and converts them into a list of integers. Since `a` and `t` are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged. The list `b` is updated to contain the integers from the input, each converted to an integer type.
