#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case in test_cases is a list containing three elements: an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid, where each string consists of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>' indicating the direction of the arrow in each cell.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing either all 'YES' or a mix of 'YES' and 'NO', depending on the contents of `test_cases`. For each `test_case` in `test_cases`, if `reachable_second_row` is True at the end of the loop execution for that `test_case`, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'. Otherwise, it is 'NO'. The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are reset to their initial states (False and False, respectively) before each new `test_case` is processed. The variable `j` is set to `n` at the end of each iteration through `test_cases`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain one 'YES' for every `test_case` where `reachable_second_row` was True at the end of processing that `test_case`, and 'NO' otherwise.
    return results
    #`results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether `reachable_second_row` was True at the end of processing each `test_case` in `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and two strings representing the first and second rows of a grid. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to move from the first row to the second row following the directions of the arrows (`<` or `>`). If such a path exists, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. The function returns a list of 'YES' and 'NO' values based on the outcome for each test case.
