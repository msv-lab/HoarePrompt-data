Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for v in arr:`. The variables mentioned here are `v` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `prefix` is a list containing only the value 0. This variable is not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted.
   - `v` is the loop variable that will take on the values from the list `arr` during each iteration. Initially, `v` is not defined because the loop has not started executing.
   - `arr` is the list that the loop will iterate over. Since `prefix` is a list containing only the value 0, it implies that `arr` is a list of some elements (though their exact nature is not specified).

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. The initial state of `prefix` does not affect the loop's execution, so it remains unchanged.
   - `v` will be assigned the first element of `arr` in the first iteration, but since we are only concerned with the initial state before the loop starts, `v` is not yet defined.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `arr` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`prefix` is a list containing only the value 0, `arr` must contain at least one element**
