Output State: **`a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, `m` is equal to 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the innermost if statement. Since no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement, the values of `a3`, `l3`, `val`, and `m` remain unchanged.
