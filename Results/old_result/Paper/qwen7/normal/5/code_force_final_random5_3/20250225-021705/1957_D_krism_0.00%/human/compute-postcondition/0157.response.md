Output State: **`ans` is increased by pre[4][0] * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1], `j` is 31, `c` is prefix[i], `pre[31][1]` is 32, and `suf[31][1]` is -32, `k` is 4, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `c` to be equal to `prefix[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `ans` is not directly affected by this line of code since no operation involving `ans` is performed here.
