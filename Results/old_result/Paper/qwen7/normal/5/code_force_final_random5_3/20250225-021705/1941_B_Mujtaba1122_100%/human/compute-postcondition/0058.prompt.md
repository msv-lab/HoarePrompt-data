Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: list is a list of integers representing the array a, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 \* 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
        list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
        list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if list[i - 1] != 0:
        print('no')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop continues until `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1 or `list[i - 1]` or `list[i + 1]` is no longer greater than 0. After all iterations, `list[0]` will be -4 * (n-1), where n is the initial value of `list[0]`, `list[1]` will be 0, and the rest of the elements in the list will be adjusted based on the operations performed within the loop. Specifically, each element from `list[2]` onwards will be reduced according to the operations performed, with `list[2]` being the last element that remains greater than 0 and all subsequent elements becoming 0 if they were originally greater than 0. Additionally, the condition `(list[i - 1] == 0)` holds true for the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements in the list except `list[i+1]` are now 0, and `list[i+1]` is now 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in the list except `list[i+2]` are now 0, and `list[i+2]` is now 0, `list[i]` is now 0, `list[i - 1]` is now 0, `list[i + 1]` is now 0, and `list[i - 1]` is not an integer greater than 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
