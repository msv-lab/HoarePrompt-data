Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n - 1`, which is its initial value since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop runs `n` times. The list `l` will have its elements updated such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`. All other variables (`res`, `k`, `a`, `ul`, `ur`, `re`, `r`) will retain their initial values or states as no operations affecting them are specified within the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will return to its initial value of `2 * n - 1`. The list `l` will be modified according to the values in list `a`, with each element `l[a[i] - 1]` incremented once for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. All other variables will stay as they were initially.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is unchanged, `r[a[i-1]]` is incremented by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
