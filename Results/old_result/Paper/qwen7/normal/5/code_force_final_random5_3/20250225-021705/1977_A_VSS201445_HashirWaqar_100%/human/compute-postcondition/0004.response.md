Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user and is greater than or equal to `m`.
- `m` is the second integer entered by the user.
- The difference between `n` and `m` is even.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement outputs the string `'YES'` directly, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and the conditions described for them.

Output: **YES**
