Output State: **`left` is now `left - 1`, `leftZero` is less than `left // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 2) // 2`, either `rightZero` is increased by 1 or `rightOne` is increased by 1 depending on whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or not.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is decremented by 1, making it `left - 1`. The conditions involving `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, and the character check at `s[left - 1]` remain unchanged.
