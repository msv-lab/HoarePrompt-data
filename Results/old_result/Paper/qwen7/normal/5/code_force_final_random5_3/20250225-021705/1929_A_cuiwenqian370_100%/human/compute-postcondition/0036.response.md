Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but is expected to work within a context where a variable t is defined, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives a list (array) of n integers, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], and returns an integer representing the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.**
