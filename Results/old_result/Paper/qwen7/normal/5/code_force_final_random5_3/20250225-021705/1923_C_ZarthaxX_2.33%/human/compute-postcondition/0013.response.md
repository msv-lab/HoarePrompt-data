Output State: **`ones[3]` is 1, `ones[2]` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except for the first element which is 1, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `sum[4]` is `sum[3] + nums[3] - 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` list such that `sum[i]` is equal to `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`. Given that initially `sum[0]` to `sum[3]` are all 0, `sum[4]` will be calculated as `sum[3] + nums[3] - 1`. Since `sum[3]` is 0, `sum[4]` becomes `0 + nums[3] - 1`, which simplifies to `nums[3] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
