Postcondition: `right` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`, and either `tleftZero` or `trightOne` must meet the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)`. In both cases (whether `s[right] == '0'` or not), either `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1, or `trightOne` is decremented by 1.
