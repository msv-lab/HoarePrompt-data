Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is now (`leftZero` - 1), `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially less than `(left + 1) // 2`, decrementing it by 1 will still keep it less than `(left + 1) // 2`. The value of `left` remains unchanged, and the condition for `rightOne` also remains valid as it depends on `n` and `left`, which haven't changed.
