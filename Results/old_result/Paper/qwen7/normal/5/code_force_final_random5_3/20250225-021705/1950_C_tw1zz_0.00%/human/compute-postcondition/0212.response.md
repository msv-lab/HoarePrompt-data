Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h1` is "08", `m1` is equal to the new `m`, `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `h1 = '08'` assigns the string `'08'` to the variable `h1`. The other variables (`s`, `t`, `m1`, and `time`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
