Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(len(a))`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**:
   - `k`: This is the loop variable.
   - `len(a)`: This is the upper bound of the loop.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 0
   - `len(a)` is 1
   - `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`
   - `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 0 and `len(a)` is 1.
   - Since `0 < 1` is true, the loop can execute again.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `k` will be incremented by 1, so `k` will be 1.
   - `len(a)` remains unchanged, so it is still 1.
   - `t1` and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so they remain as they are.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`k` is 1, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`**
