Output State: **`i` is `n`, `a` is a list starting with `[1000]` and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding value from the list `T` up to `n-1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of list `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` joins the elements of the list `a` into a single string where each element is converted to a string and separated by a space. Since the list `a` remains unchanged, `i` is still `n`, and `a` contains the same elements as before, the only new variable introduced is `result`, which is a string representation of the list `a`.
