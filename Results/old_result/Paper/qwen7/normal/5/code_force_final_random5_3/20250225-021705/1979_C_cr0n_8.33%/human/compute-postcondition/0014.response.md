Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `N` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\).
- `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`.
- `r` is the last element of `vals`.
- `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of `prod` divided by each element `r` in `vals` (excluding the last element).
- `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and the value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(-1)
```

Given that `den` is explicitly stated to be less than or equal to 0, the print statement will directly output `-1`.

Output: **-1**
