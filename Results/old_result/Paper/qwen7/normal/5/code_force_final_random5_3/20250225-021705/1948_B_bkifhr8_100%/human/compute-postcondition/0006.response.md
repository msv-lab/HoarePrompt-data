Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True, `i` is m - 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`.**
