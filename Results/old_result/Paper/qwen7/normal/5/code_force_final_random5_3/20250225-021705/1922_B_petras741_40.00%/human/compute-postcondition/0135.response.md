Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces, `q` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `q`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `w`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only new variable introduced is `q`, which is an empty dictionary.
