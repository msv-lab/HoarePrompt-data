Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`. This means the loop will iterate over each value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as there are values left in `num_of_lens.values()`. Since `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value at the start, the loop will execute as long as `num_of_lens` still has values.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `num_of_lens`: Since `cnt` is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`, the dictionary `num_of_lens` will lose one of its values after each iteration.
   - `cnt`: This will be updated to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given that `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value at the start, and it loses one value per iteration, the loop will continue until `num_of_lens` has no more values.

Here is the modified state at the start of the next iteration:

- `num_of_lens` will have lost one of its values, so it must contain at least one less value than before.
- `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Since `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value initially, after one iteration, it must contain at least zero values (but since it must always contain at least one value, it will contain exactly one value).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.
