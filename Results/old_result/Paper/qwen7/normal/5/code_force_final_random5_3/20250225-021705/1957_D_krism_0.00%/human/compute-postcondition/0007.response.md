Output State: **`prefix` is [0, v ^ 0, v ^ (v ^ 0)], `arr` must contain at least one element**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` XORed with the last element of `prefix` to `prefix`. Initially, `prefix` is `[0, v ^ 0]`. After the operation, `prefix` becomes `[0, v ^ 0, v ^ (v ^ 0)]`. The value of `arr` remains unchanged, but we know it must contain at least one element.
