Postcondition: `cur` is 0, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is an empty dictionary, and either `num` is the last element of `N` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `num` is not greater than `cur + 1` and no change is made to `cur` and `i`.
