Output State: **`i` is the fourth element of `arr`; `pos` is 1; `o_l` is increased by 1.**

The code `o_l += 1` increments the value of `o_l` by 1. Since `o_l` was not initialized or given a specific value in the initial state, we only know that it has been increased by 1. The values of `i` and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial states.
