Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is not used in the main logic. Instead, the code directly checks the frequency of each number without using the function's intended purpose.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Minimum Cards**: The logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed. Specifically:
   - The code checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If true, it prints `n`, which is incorrect because we can always reduce the number of cards to at least `k-1`.
   - The code then uses an undefined function `func_1` to get the frequency table but does not use this information correctly.
   - The logic for checking if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and printing `k-1` is incorrect and does not handle all edge cases.

3. **Missing Key Steps**: The solution lacks key steps to ensure that the minimum number of cards is calculated correctly. It should consider how often each card type appears and how many exchanges can be made to minimize the total number of cards.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to count the frequency of each card type and then determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed. The minimum number of cards will be the sum of the remainders when the counts are divided by `k`.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += (count // k) * (k - 1) + (count % k)
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum number of cards by considering the frequency of each card type and performing the necessary exchanges to minimize the total number of cards.
