Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The conditions for determining whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither are correctly implemented:
   - `a < b < c` checks for a stair.
   - `a == b == c` checks for the special case where all digits are the same, which should result in "NONE".
   - `max(a, b, c) == b` checks for a peak.
4. The program handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` as specified in the problem statement.
5. The output for each test case matches the expected results based on the given examples.

Given this analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem description and produces the correct outputs for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
