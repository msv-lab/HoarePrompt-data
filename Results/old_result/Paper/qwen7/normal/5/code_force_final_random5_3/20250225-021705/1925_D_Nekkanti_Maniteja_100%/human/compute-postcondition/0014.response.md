Output State: **`u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is `a + f`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `m` is `m_prev`**.

Explanation: The code `a += f` increments the value of `a` by the value of `f`. The values of `u`, `v`, `i`, `m`, and `i_prev` remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` is updated to `a + f`, while the other variables retain their initial or previously stated values.
