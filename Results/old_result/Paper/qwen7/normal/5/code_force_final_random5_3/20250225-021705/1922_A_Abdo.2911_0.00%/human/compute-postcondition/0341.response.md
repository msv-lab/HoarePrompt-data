Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` representing the number of iterations, an integer `n` indicating the length of strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, and two strings `a` and `b`, and one string `c`, all consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it constructs a template from string `a` by converting differing characters to uppercase. Then, it checks if the template matches `a` and `b` under specific conditions but does not match `c`. If these conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
