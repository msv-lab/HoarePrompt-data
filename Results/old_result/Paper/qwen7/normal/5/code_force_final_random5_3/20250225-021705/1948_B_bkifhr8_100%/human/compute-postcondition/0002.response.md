Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `m`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
