Output State: **`leftZero` is 0, `left` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `left` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `right` is equal to `n` or less than `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The code sets `rightZero` to 0, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `leftZero`, `left`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `right`, `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `s` remain unchanged. Only `rightZero` is updated to 0.
