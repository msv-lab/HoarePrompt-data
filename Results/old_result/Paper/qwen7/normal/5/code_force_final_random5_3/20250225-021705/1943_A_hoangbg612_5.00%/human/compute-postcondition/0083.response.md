Output State: **`cur` is increased by 1, `N` must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `cur`, `N`, or `num`. It only indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside.
