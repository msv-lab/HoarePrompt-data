Output State: **`result` is equal to `func_1(result, num)`, `numbers` must have at least two elements**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `result` by calling the function `func_1` with `result` and `num` as arguments. The initial value of `result` is the first element of the `numbers` list, and `num` is the second element of the `numbers` list since `numbers` must have at least two elements. However, since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. We only know that `result` is now the result of the function call `func_1(result, num)`. The precondition that `numbers` must have at least two elements remains valid.
