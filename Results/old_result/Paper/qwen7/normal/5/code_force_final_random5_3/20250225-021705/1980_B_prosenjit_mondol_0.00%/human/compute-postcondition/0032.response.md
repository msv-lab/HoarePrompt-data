Postcondition: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer obtained from the input split, `f` is now f-1, `k` is f-2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`. No changes are made to the variables regardless of whether `a[k] > x` or `a[k] <= x`.**
