Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds true, and if `a == b == c`, then `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal. If `a != b != c`, then the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is either equal to `b` or not equal to `b`.
