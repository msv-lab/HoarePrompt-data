Output State: **`index` is 7 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`.**

The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `t` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The `results` list remains empty, and `arr` is still a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`.
