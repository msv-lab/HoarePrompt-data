Output State: **`right` is `mid + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `trightZero` is either decreased by 1 or remains the same, `trightOne` is either decreased by 1 or remains the same, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[mid + 1]` is not '0', `s[mid + 1]` is '0' if `tleftZero` is increased by 1, otherwise `s[mid + 1]` is not '0'**.

This means that the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, becoming `mid + 1`. The other variables maintain their previous conditions unless specifically altered by the code, which in this case, does not happen.
