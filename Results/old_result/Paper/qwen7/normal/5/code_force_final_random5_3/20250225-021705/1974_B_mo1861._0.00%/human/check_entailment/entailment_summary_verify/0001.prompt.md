You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and decodes it using a character mapping. It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a corresponding character based on its position in `b`. Then, it constructs a new string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding value from `char_map`. Finally, it returns the decoded string `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understand the Problem**: The task is to decode an encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating a sorted string `r` of unique characters from `s` and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding character from the reverse of `r`.
2. **Analyze the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string itself.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`.
   - In `func_1`, a dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in the reverse of `r`. This mapping is done by sorting the unique characters of `b`, and then for each character in the sorted list, it maps it to the character at the corresponding position from the end of the sorted list.
   - Finally, the function iterates through each character in `b`, looks up the corresponding character in `char_map`, and constructs the decoded string `s`.

3. **Check the Logic**:
   - The creation of `char_map` ensures that each character in `b` is correctly mapped to its counterpart in the reverse of `r`.
   - The iteration through `b` and constructing `s` using `char_map` is logically sound and should produce the correct decoded string.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.
