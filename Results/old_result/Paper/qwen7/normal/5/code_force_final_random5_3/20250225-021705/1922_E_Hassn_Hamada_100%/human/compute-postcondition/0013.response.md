Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Loop Condition
The loop condition is given by:
\[ (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) \leq number \]

### Step 2: Analyze the Given States
- `size_overlap` is (1, 1)
- `sequence` must be non-negative
- `i` must be at least 1
- `size` is `i + 2`
- `value` is \(2^{i+2} - 2^i\)
- `number` must be at least 3

### Step 3: Substitute the Known Values into the Loop Condition
We know:
- `size = i + 2`
- `value = 2^{i+2} - 2^i`

Substitute `size = i + 2` into the loop condition:
\[ (1 << (i + 2) + 1) - (1 << i) \leq number \]
\[ (1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i) \leq number \]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[ 2^{i + 3} - 2^i \leq number \]

Given `value = 2^{i+2} - 2^i`, we can rewrite the inequality as:
\[ 2 \cdot 2^{i+2} - 2^i \leq number \]
\[ 2 \cdot value \leq number \]

### Step 4: Determine the Necessary Adjustments
To ensure the loop executes one more time, the condition must hold true. We need to check the current values and determine what adjustments are necessary.

From the given states:
- `i` must be at least 1
- `size` is `i + 2`
- `value` is \(2^{i+2} - 2^i\)
- `number` must be at least 3

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition:
\[ 2 \cdot value \leq number \]
must be satisfied.

Since `value` is \(2^{i+2} - 2^i\), let's consider the smallest possible value for `i` which is 1:
- If `i = 1`, then `size = 1 + 2 = 3`
- `value = 2^{1+2} - 2^1 = 2^3 - 2^1 = 8 - 2 = 6`
- The condition becomes: \(2 \cdot 6 \leq number\) or \(12 \leq number\)

Thus, for `i = 1`, `number` must be at least 12 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step 5: Adjust the States
Given the above analysis, we need to ensure that `number` is at least 12 for the loop to execute one more time. The other states (`size_overlap`, `sequence`, and `value`) do not need adjustment as they are already correctly set based on the loop condition.

### Final Answer:
State: **`size_overlap` is (1, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 1, `size` is `i + 2`, `value` is \(2^{i+2} - 2^i\), and `number` must be at least 12**
