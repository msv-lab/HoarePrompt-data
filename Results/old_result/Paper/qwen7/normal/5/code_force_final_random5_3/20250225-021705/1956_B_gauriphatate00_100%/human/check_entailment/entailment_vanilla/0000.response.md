Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by optimally choosing cards to play against Nene, who also plays optimally.
2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of numbers on the cards in your hand (`a`).
   - It then calls a function `func_1` to compute the maximum number of points you can get.
   - The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each number in your hand using a dictionary `count_a`.
   - It then iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`, checking if they exist in `count_a`. If a number exists and its count is 2, it increments the `max_score`.
3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` assumes that having two cards of the same number means you can get a point when you play that card. However, this logic does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.
   - Specifically, the function only checks if you have two cards of the same number and counts it as a potential point. This does not consider Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score.
   - According to the problem statement, Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. Therefore, simply counting pairs of the same number is not sufficient.
4. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the example provided, the function would incorrectly calculate the score for the first test case as 1, but the correct answer should be 1 as explained in the problem statement.
   - The function does not simulate the entire game or account for Nene's optimal strategy.

Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
