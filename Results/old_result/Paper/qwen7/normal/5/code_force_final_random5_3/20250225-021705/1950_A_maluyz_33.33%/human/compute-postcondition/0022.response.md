Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `a` is the first input integer.
- `b` is the second input integer.
- `c` is the third input integer.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
