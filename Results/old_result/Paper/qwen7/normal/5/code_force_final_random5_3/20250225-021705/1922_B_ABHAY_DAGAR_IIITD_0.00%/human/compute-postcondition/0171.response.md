Output State: The `results` list will contain the total number of unique triplets of sticks that can be formed for each set of inputs provided across all iterations of the loop. Each element in the `results` list represents the sum of all valid combinations of stick lengths that meet the criteria specified in the loop for each test case.

In other words, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `results` list will have been fully populated with the total count of unique triplets for each test case, and the `result` variable will hold the final value for the last test case processed.
