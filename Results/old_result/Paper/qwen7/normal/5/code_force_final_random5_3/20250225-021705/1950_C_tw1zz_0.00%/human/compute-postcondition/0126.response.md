Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is '21', `m` is the minute part of the time input as a string, `h1` is '09', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM'.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
