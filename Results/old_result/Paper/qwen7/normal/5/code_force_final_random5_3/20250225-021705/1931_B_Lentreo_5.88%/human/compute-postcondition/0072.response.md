Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the final `nums` list minus the last element of the final `nums` list.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `curr` will hold the value of the sum of all non-zero elements present in the `nums` list (after any modifications made during the loop) minus the last element of that final `nums` list. The loop continues to update `curr` based on the condition that it only adds the difference between each non-zero element and the previous last element (`last`) in the updated `nums` list.
