Output State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `n` is greater than 1, the value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1**.

Explanation: The code sets both `idx1` and `idx2` to the value of `i`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
