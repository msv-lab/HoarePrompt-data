Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i+1]` is equal to `b[i+1] - 2 * b[i]` for all `i`, `i` is `a - 2`, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` decreases the value of `b[i + 2]` by the value of `b[i]`. Given that `b[i]` is 0, the value of `b[i + 2]` will also become 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
