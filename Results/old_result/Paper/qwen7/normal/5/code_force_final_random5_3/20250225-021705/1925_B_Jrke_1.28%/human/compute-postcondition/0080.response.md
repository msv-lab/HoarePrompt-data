Postcondition: `l` is a list. If `x % i == 0`, then `l` contains 'ans', 'i', and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it contains only 'ans'. Here, 'ans' is the maximum value between the existing 'ans' in `l` and `x // i` if applicable. If the condition `x % i == 0` is not met, `l` remains unchanged.
