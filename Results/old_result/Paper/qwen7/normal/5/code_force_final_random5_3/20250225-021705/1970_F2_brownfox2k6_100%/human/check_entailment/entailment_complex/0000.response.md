Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly updates the position of an object (player or ball) based on the direction provided. It handles all four possible directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and updates the coordinates accordingly. The function does not return an error for invalid directions, but it still processes the valid ones correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly identifies players who are in the same position as the Bludger and marks them as eliminated by setting their positions to `[-1, -1]`. It then prints a message for each eliminated player in alphabetical order. The logic is sound and the function adheres to the problem requirements.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly initializes the field, players, goals, and the Bludger.
   - It processes each step of the game, updating the positions of players and the ball based on the actions provided.
   - It correctly handles scoring when a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal.
   - It correctly handles player elimination when a player is hit by the Bludger.
   - It prints the appropriate messages for each event and the final score at the end of the game.

Given that all parts of the program correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
