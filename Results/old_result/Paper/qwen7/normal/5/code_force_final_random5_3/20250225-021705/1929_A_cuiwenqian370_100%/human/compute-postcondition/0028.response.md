To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the loop head and identify the relevant variables and their states.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Relevant Variables
- `result`: This variable is used to iterate over the `results` list.
- `results`: This is a list containing the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration.
- `func_1(array)`: This function is called with an array derived from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `data`: This is the input list from which arrays are sliced.
- `index`: This variable is used to slice the `data` list.
- `n`: This is determined as `int(data[index])`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution
For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. The `results` list must contain at least one element.
2. The `index` variable must be such that there are enough elements in `data` to create the required arrays for `func_1`.
3. The `t` variable must be greater than 0, indicating that there are enough elements in `data` to complete all iterations.

### Adjusting States
Based on the given conditions, the states that need to be adjusted are:

1. **`t` must be greater than 0**: This ensures that there are enough elements in `data` to complete all iterations.
2. **`index` must be set appropriately**: This ensures that there are enough elements in `data` to create the required arrays for `func_1`.
3. **`results` list must contain at least one element**: This indicates that the loop has completed at least one iteration.

### Final State Adjustment
Combining these conditions, the final state adjustment needed for the loop to execute is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is set such that there are enough elements in `data` to create the required arrays, and `results` list contains at least one element**.

This ensures that the loop can execute and the conditions for the loop body to run are met.
