Output State: **`end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is `start - 1`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, and if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`. Additionally, `s` is increased by either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` depending on whether `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or not.**

Explanation: The line `start += inc` increments the value of `start` by the value of `inc`, which is -1. Therefore, `start` becomes `start - 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
