### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Understanding the Problem
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Functions
1. **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **`func_2(n, m)`**: This function attempts to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) but uses incorrect logic.

#### Analysis of `func_2` Implementation
The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\). It calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\), and then increments the count `cnt` by `x // y` and adds 1 if \(i > 1\).

Let's break down the logic in `func_2`:
- **Expression \(x = n - (i * i - i)\)**: This expression does not have any relation to the problem statement. It seems to be unrelated to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- **Expression \(y = i * i\)**: This simply calculates \(i^2\).
- **Incrementing `cnt` by `x // y`**: This operation does not reflect the required condition. It does not consider the GCD or the multiple condition.
- **Adding 1 if \(i > 1\)**: This part is also irrelevant to the problem statement.

Given these observations, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
