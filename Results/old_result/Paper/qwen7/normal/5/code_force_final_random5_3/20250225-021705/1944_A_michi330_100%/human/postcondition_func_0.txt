The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \). If true, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints \( n \). After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each test case.
