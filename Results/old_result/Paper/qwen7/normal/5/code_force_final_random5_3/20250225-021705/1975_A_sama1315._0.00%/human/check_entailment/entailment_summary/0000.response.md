### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them any number of times.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It returns 'Yes' if all elements are in non-decreasing order.
   - It returns 'No' if there is at least one element that is greater than the next element.
   - However, this function does not account for the possibility of sorting the array through swaps of prefixes and suffixes.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases and processing each one.
   - The logic in `func_2` does not implement the required functionality to check if the array can be sorted through the allowed operations (swapping prefixes and suffixes).
   - Instead, it relies solely on `func_1`, which only checks if the array is already sorted, not if it can be sorted through the allowed operations.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - The examples provided show that `func_2` does not handle the problem correctly. For instance, in the second test case, the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` can be sorted by the allowed operations, but `func_1` would incorrectly return 'No' because the array is not already sorted.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
