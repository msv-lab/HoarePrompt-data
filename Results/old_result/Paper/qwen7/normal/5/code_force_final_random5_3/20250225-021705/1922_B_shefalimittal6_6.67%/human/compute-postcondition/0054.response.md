Output State: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `nums` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that element appears in `nums`, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must contain at least three elements, and `x` is the last element of `nums` after all iterations of the loop have completed.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain the frequency of each number present in the list `nums`. The variable `res` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `n` and the list `nums` retain their initial values from the input, and `x` will be the last number processed in the list `nums`.
