Postcondition: `i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise it can be either True or False, `b` contains the value `maxa` (which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`), `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` is a list containing the element `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `s` contains the value `a[ps - 1]` and if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, then `s` is also equal to `maxa`; otherwise, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.
