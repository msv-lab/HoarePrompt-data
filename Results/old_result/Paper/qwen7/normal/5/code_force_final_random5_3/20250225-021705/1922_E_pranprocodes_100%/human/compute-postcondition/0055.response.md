Output State: **`x` is any integer except 1, `t` is 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing `-100000000`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an odd number**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Given that `min` is initially -100000000, `ans` becomes a list containing `-100000000`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
