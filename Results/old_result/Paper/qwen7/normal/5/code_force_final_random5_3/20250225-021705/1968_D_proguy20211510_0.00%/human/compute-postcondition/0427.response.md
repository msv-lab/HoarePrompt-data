Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 4`, `sb` is the concatenation of `sb` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` appends the value of `b[i]` to `sb`. Since `i` was previously `i_prev + 3`, after executing the code, `i` becomes `i_prev + 4`. The value of `sb` is updated by concatenating `b[i]` to its current value.
