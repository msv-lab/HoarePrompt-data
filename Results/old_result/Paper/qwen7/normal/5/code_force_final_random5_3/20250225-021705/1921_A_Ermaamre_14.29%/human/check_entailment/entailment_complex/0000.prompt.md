Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. Each testcase is described over four lines, where each line contains two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. There are t such testcases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and it is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
            if y1 < y3:
                res = abs(y3 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y3)
        elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        
        print(res ** 2)
        
    #State: a is an input integer, i is equal to a-1 (since the loop runs from 0 to a-1), x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are input integers from the last iteration of the loop, and res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1 if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4 hold true, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1 if x1 == x2 and x3 == x4 or x1 == x4 and x3 == x2 holds true, and res remains unchanged in other cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defining a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For each test case, it calculates the side length of the square by determining the vertical distance between two opposite corners. It then prints the square of this side length.
