Output State: **`j` is the next character in `inpstr`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `ind1` is `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, it simply breaks out of the context it was intended for, which is implied to be the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `j`, `i`, and `ind1` remain unchanged.
