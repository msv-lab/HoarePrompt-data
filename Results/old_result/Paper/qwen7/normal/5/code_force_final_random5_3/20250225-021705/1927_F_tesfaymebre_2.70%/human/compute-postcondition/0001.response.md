State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(test_cases):` indicates that the loop will iterate `test_cases` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be a non-negative integer, but since `range()` typically expects a positive integer (0 is inclusive but often not meaningful in this context), `test_cases` should be strictly greater than 0.
3. No other variables or states outside the loop head (`test_cases`) need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
