Output State: **`tleftZero` is either 1 or 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `rightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is either 1 or 4, and `leftZero` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially either 0 or 2, after the increment, it becomes either 1 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
