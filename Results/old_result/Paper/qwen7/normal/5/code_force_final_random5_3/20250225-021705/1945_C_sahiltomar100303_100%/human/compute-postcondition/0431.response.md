Output State: **`right` is `mid + 2`, `n` remains unchanged. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `trightZero` is decreased by 1, `trightOne` must be less than \(\frac{n - mid}{2} + 1\), and `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[mid + 1]` is not '0'. If `s[mid + 1]` is '0', `tleftZero` is increased by 1, otherwise `s[mid + 1]` is not '0'. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `tleftZero` must be less than \(\left\lceil \frac{mid + 2}{2} \right\rceil - 1\), `trightZero` is either decreased by 1 or remains the same, `trightOne` is now \(\frac{n - mid}{2}\), `tleftOne` is increased by 1, and `s[mid + 1]` is not '0'.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` was set to `mid + 1`. After executing the code, `right` becomes `mid + 2`. All other conditions and variables remain as described in the initial state.
