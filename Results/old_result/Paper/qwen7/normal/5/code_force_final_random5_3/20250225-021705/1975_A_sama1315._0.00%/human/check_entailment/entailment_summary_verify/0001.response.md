### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly according to the problem statement. However, let's break down the reasoning in more detail to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It uses `all()` to verify that every element is less than or equal to the next element.
- It returns 'Yes' if the array is sorted.
- It uses `any()` to check if there is at least one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element.
- If such a pair exists, it returns 'No', otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

This function correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted and correctly identifies when the array is not sorted.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function reads the entire input at once and processes it to handle multiple test cases.
- It extracts the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.
- It calls `func_1` for each array and collects the results.
- Finally, it prints the results, each on a new line.

This function correctly processes the input and handles multiple test cases as required.

Given the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly determines if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Since the function `func_1` always returns the correct result based on whether the array is already sorted or not, and `func_2` correctly processes the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, the overall program is correct.

### Final Evaluation
