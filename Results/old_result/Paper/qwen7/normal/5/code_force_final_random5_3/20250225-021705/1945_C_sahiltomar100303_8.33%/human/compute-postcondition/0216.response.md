Output State: All variables remain unchanged except `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne`. After the loop executes all iterations, `rightZero` will be equal to the total number of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, and `trightZero` will be equal to `rightZero` minus the initial count of '0's at `mid`. Similarly, `rightOne` will be equal to the total number of '1's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, and `trightOne` will be equal to `rightOne` minus the initial count of '1's at `mid`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` after the loop completes, and both `mid` and `n` will retain their initial values.
