Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here's why:

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**: The program first checks if the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`. This is a necessary condition for making the amount of water in all containers the same, as each container would then contain `total // n` units of water.

2. **Mean Calculation**: If the sum is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have (`mean = total // n`).

3. **Balance Check**: The program then iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current container's water and the mean is balanced out across all containers. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water, and the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
