You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each test case consists of three integers n, f, and k such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, followed by a list of n integers a_i where 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        f -= 1
        
        k -= 1
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = a[f]
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:

        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. `num` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer obtained from the last input split, `f` is now `n - int(input())`, `k` is also `n - int(input())`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the last input split sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`, and the number of iterations left is 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the favorite cube is exactly equal to the k-th largest value but still remains in the list after the first k cubes are removed. This can happen if there are multiple cubes with the same value as the k-th largest value, and the favorite cube is one of them.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5 5 4
3 1 2 4 5
```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  MAYBE
  ```

In this case, the sorted list is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. The favorite cube is the 5th (last) cube with the value 5. After removing the first 4 cubes, the list becomes `[1]`, and the favorite cube is not removed. However, the program outputs `MAYBE` because it checks if the k-th largest value is greater than the favorite cube's value, which is not the correct logic in this scenario.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
