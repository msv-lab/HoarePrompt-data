Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` remains False, `i` equals `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `c` is the stripped input string from user, `template` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `template`. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
