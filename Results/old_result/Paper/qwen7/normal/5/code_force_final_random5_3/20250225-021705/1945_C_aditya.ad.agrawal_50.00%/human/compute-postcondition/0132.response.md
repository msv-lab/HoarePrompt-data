Output State: **`dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `o_r` is `o`, `z_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z`, `b_d` is 30001.**

The code assigns the value 30001 to the variable `b_d`. This is the only change made to the variables, and all other variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
