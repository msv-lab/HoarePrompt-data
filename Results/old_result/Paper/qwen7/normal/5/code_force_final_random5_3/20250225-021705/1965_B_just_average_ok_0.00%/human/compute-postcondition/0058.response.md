Output State: The loop will continue to execute for each test case provided by the user until all test cases are processed. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `idx` will be equal to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` for the last test case processed. `nums` will be a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{\text{idx} - 1}\), with the following elements added based on the value of `k` for the last test case:

- `k - 2^{\text{idx} - 1}`
- `k + 1`
- `k + 2^{\text{idx} - 1} + 1`

Additionally, the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) will be removed from `nums`. The length of `nums` will be \(\text{idx} + 3\).

The loop will print the length of `nums` and then print the elements of `nums` in the order they appear in the list. This process will repeat for each test case, and once all test cases are processed, the final state of `nums` will reflect the last test case's `k` value and the corresponding `idx`.
