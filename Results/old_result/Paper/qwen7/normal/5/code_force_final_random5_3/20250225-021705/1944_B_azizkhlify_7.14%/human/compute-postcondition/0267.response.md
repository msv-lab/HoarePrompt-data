Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the Current State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
   - `i` is updated to `i + 1`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is updated to `i + 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `i + 1` must be less than `n`, implying that `i` was originally less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` is updated to `i + 1` from the previous iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- To ensure the loop continues, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `i + 1` must be less than `n`**
