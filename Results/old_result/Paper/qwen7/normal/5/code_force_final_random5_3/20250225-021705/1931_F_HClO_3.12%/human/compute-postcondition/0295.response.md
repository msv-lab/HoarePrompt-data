Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `t` (which is the total number of iterations) and the loop counter `_`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers. The condition for continuing the loop is that `l3` contains all elements of `l` except `a3`.

3. **Check the loop continuation condition**: For the loop to continue, `l3` must still contain all elements of `l` except `a3`. This means that as long as `l3` still contains all elements of `l` except `a3`, the loop will continue.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `l3` contains all elements of `l` except `a3`, the only thing that changes is the value of `_` (which becomes `_ + 1`).

5. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect the updated value of `_` and the unchanged values of `a3` and `l3` until the loop breaks or completes all iterations.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_` plus 1.**

However, since the specific value of `_` is not given, we can generalize it as follows:

**State: `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_` plus 1.**

For clarity, let's denote the current value of `_` as `current_index` (which is `current_index + 1` for the next iteration):

**State: `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, and `t` must be greater than `current_index + 1`.**

Since the exact value of `current_index` is not specified, we can represent it as `current_index`:

**State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, and `t` must be greater than `current_index + 1`**.
