Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a` with one additional element `a[i]`, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i] / 10`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `c`. The values of `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` now contains all the elements it previously had plus the new element `a[i]`.
