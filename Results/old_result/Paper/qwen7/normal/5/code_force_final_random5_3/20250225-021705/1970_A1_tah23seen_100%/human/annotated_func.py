#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the length of `s`, and `d[n]` is the final depth value calculated based on the parentheses in `s`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, and then by the negative first element of each tuple, `i` is the first element of the last tuple in `d`, `j` is the second element of the last tuple in `d`, and `ans` is the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in `d`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `d` remains sorted as initially described, `i` and `j` will refer to the last tuple in `d`, and `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of `s[i]` for all tuples `(i, j)` in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")`. It calculates the depth of each parenthesis in the string and stores these depths in a dictionary `d`. The dictionary is then sorted based on the depth values, and the function constructs a new string `ans` by concatenating the characters from `s` corresponding to the keys in the sorted dictionary. Finally, the function returns the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in the sorted dictionary `d`.
