Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `nums[1]`, `nums[1]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**

Explanation: The code `k -= nums[i]` subtracts the value of `nums[i]` from `k`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `nums[i]` is updated to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. Since `i` remains 1, `nums[1]` is now equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and `k` is decreased by the value of `nums[1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
