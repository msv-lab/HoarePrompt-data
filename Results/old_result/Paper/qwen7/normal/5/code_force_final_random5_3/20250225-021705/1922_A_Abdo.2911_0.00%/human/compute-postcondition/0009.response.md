Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[0]` is appended to `template`, and the value of `b[0]` is equal to the value of `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i]` to the list `template`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[0]` is appended to `template`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the relationship between `a[0]` and `b[0]` remain unchanged.
