Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`.

### For Loop Statement
```
for x in str(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head defines the variable `x` as each character in the string representation of `i`.
2. **Loop Execution**: In each iteration, `x` takes the value of a single character from the string representation of `i`.
3. **State Adjustment**: We need to determine the state of `sum_value_digits` and `i` at the start of the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`.
   - `i` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue to iterate over the characters in the string representation of `i`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be the next character in the string representation of `i`.
   - `sum_value_digits` will be further updated based on the next character `x`.

### Updated State
- `sum_value_digits` will be increased by the integer value of the next character in the string representation of `i`.
- `i` remains unchanged.

### Final Answer
State: **`sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the next character in the string representation of `i`, `i` remains unchanged**.

To provide a concrete example, if `i` is "123" and `x` was '1' in the previous iteration, then for the next iteration:
- `x` will be '2'.
- `sum_value_digits` will be increased by the integer value of '2'.

So, the state would be:
State: **`sum_value_digits` is increased by 2, `i` remains unchanged**.
