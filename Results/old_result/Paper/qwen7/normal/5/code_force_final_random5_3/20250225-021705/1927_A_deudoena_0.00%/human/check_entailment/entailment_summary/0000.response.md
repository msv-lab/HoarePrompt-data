Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by finding the first and last positions of 'B' in the input string and calculating the minimum segment length required to turn all cells white. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. The program does not handle cases where the entire strip is already white.
2. The calculation of `ind2` is incorrect because it starts from the end of the string and finds the first 'B' from the right, which might not be the last 'B' in the string.
3. The formula used to calculate the segment length (`len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`) is incorrect. It should be `ind2 - ind1 + 1` to get the correct segment length.

Given these issues, the program will not always produce the correct result.

Correctness: **False**
