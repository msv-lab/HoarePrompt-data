Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` must be different from 3, `s` is the sum of 1 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, `start` is 3, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s + abs(lst[3] - lst[2])`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, `d1[start]` is `s + abs(lst[3] - lst[2])`, and `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. Given that `start` is 3 and `inc` is 1, `s` is updated to include `abs(lst[3] - lst[4])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
