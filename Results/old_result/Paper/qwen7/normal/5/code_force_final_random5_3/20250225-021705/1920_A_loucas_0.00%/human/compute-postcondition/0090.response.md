Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `a` is now an integer derived from splitting the input and converting it to an integer and appending to the list `big`, `iterable2` is 2, and `innerLoop` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is an integer derived from splitting the input and converting it to an integer, it is added to the list `big`. The values of `iterable2` and `innerLoop` remain unchanged.
