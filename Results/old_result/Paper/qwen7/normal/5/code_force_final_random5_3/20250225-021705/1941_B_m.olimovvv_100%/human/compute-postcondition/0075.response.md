Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, and `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
