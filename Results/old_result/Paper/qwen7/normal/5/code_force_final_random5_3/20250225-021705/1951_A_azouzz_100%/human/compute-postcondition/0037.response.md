Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` itself is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer (though `n` is not used in the print statement).
- `s` is a new input string (though `s` is not used in the print statement).
- `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s` (though `cnt1` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
