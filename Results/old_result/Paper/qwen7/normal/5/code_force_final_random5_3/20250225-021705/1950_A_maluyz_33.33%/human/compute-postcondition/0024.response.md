Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `a` is the first input integer
- `b` is the second input integer
- `c` is the third input integer

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NONE'`. Since there are no variables or expressions within the `print` statement that depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`, the output will be exactly as specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **'NONE'**
