Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `pos` is 1 (or 0)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - If `arr[i]` equals `k`, then `pos` is 1; otherwise, `pos` remains 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `n > 0` must still hold true.
   - The value of `pos` will depend on whether `arr[2]` equals `k`.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `i` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `pos` will remain 1 if `arr[2]` equals `k`; otherwise, it will remain 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`pos` is 1 (or 0), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**.
