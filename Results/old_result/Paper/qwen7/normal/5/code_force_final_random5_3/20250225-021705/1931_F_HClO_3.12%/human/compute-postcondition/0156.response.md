Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a3` is the last integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0, `a2` is the first integer from the second input, and `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the second input.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a2` and the rest to `l2`. The initial state variables (`a1`, `l1`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
