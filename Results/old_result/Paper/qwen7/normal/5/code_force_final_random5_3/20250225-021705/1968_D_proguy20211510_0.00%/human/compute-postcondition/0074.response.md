Output State: **`i` is 3 or 1; `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string; `b` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`; `s` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
