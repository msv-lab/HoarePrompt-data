Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `cur` is the value of `prefix[0]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the total count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total count of bits set to 0 in the same range, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    y = arr[i - 1]
    k = y.bit_length() - 1
    ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
    c = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if c >> j & 1:
            pre[j][1] += 1
            suf[j][1] -= 1
        else:
            pre[j][0] += 1
            suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` is 31, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged (resulting in a value of 1), `suf[0][1]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged (resulting in a value of -31), `pre[j][0]` ranges from 1 to 32 depending on the binary representation of `c`, and `suf[j][0]` ranges from -31 to 0 depending on the binary representation of `c`; `suf[j][1]` ranges from -31 to 0 depending on the binary representation of `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 31, `c` remains as an integer, `pre[31][1]` is 32, and `suf[31][1]` is -32 if `(c >> j & 1)` is true for all `j` from 0 to 31; otherwise, `pre[31][0]` is 32 and `suf[31][0]` is -32.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ans` is increased by `pre[4][0] * suf[31][0] + pre[4][1] * 5`, `pre[4][1]` is 5, `suf[31][1]` is 29, `k` remains 4, `j` becomes 31, `pre[31][0]` is 32, and `suf[31][0]` is -32.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `ans` is updated based on the final counts of bits in the binary representation of `c`. Specifically, `ans` is incremented by the product of the counts of zeros and ones in the last position (`pre[4][0]` and `pre[4][1]`) multiplied by the respective suffix counts (`suf[31][0]` and `suf[31][1]`). The variable `pre[31][0]` is set to 32, and `suf[31][0]` is set to -32, indicating the total count of zeros and ones across all positions up to the 31st bit. The variable `j` resets to 31, and `k` remains at 4, with `c` and `y` retaining their previous values from the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
