Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`. The current state of `nums` is not sorted.
