Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are converted integers from the input split. If `a < b < c`, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `c`. Otherwise, the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`.
