Output State: **`s` is 0, `list2` is [0], `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string that must contain at least one space-separated word, `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting `b` by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `list2.append(int(str))` appends the integer value of the string `str` to the list `list2`. However, since `str` is not defined in the context (it is not equal to `a` or `b`), and no specific value is given for `str`, we assume `str` is treated as the string `"0"`, which when converted to an integer is `0`. Thus, `list2` becomes `[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
