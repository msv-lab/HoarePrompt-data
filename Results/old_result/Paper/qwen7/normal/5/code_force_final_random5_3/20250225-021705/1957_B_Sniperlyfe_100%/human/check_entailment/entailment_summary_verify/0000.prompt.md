You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. Then, it sets the first element `nums[0]` to a specific value based on `k`. After that, it iterates through the list, setting each subsequent element to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`, until `k` is no longer positive. Finally, it adjusts `nums[0]` by adding any remaining value of `k`. The function returns the modified list `nums`, ensuring that `i` is set to `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n`. In such cases, it is not possible to distribute the value of `k` among `n` elements such that their bitwise OR is maximized. For example, consider the input:

```
1 1
```

The program will set `nums[0]` to `2^(1.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is `0` since `1.bit_length() - 1` is `0`. Then `k` becomes `1`, and `nums[0]` is updated to `1`. However, this does not satisfy the condition that the sum of the sequence equals `1`.

A correct approach would be to initialize all elements to `0` and then distribute `k` among the elements to maximize the bitwise OR. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(k):
        nums[i % n] += 1
    return nums
```

This version ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` and attempts to maximize the bitwise OR by setting as many elements as possible to `1`.
