Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 1**

The code initializes `j` to 1. Since `i` was initially 3 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `j` and retains the initial conditions for `i` and `n`.
