Output State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` and `high` are such that `low + 1 < high`, `mid` is added to set `st` multiple times, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` in each iteration until the final search range cannot be further narrowed.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations with `low + 1 >= high`. The variable `pos` remains 2, indicating the initial position, and `n` stays greater than 0. The variable `i` is still `n-1`, representing the last index. The set `st` contains multiple values of `mid` from each iteration of the loop. The variables `low` and `high` define the final search range where no further division is possible.
