Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function accepts a binary string `s` (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2⋅10^5) consisting of only '0's and '1's. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but it processes each test case by evaluating the binary string `s`.**

This means the function `func_2` takes an integer `t` as input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives a binary string `s` of a specific length. The function processes each binary string but no explicit return value is specified in the given information.
