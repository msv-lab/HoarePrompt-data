Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), another positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D". For each test case, it returns a specific value based on the string `s` and the integers `t` and `n`.**
