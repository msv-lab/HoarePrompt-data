Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in arr`. The variables involved here are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `i` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `pos` is 2.
   - `o_l` is 0 more than its original value (so `o_l` is now equal to its original value).
   - `o_r` is 1 less than its original value.
   - `z_l` is 0 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value.
   - `ans` is 2.
   - `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the second element of `arr`.
   - `pos` should increment by 1, so it becomes 3.
   - `o_l` retains its current value since it doesn't depend on the loop variable `i`.
   - `o_r` retains its current value since it doesn't depend on the loop variable `i`.
   - `z_l` retains its current value since it doesn't depend on the loop variable `i`.
   - `ans` retains its current value since it doesn't depend on the loop variable `i`.
   - `b_d` retains its current value since it doesn't depend on the loop variable `i`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` changes to the second element of `arr`.
   - `pos` changes to 3.
   - All other variables (`o_l`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `ans`, `b_d`) retain their values.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `o_l` is 0 more than its original value, `o_r` is 1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 0 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`**.
