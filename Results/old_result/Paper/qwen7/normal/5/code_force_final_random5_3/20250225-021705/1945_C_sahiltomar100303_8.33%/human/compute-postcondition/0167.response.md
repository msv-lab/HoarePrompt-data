Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `right` is no longer `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0**

Explanation: The line `trightOne = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `trightOne`. No other variables are affected, so their previous states remain unchanged.
