Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. According to the problem description, the tribe waits for each subsequent sign to occur strictly after the previous one. However, the current implementation calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities, which is not the correct approach.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

- The LCM of 3, 2, 4, 5, 9, and 18 is 180.
- However, the correct sequence of waiting years would be:
  - First sign in year 3.
  - Second sign in year 4 (after the first sign).
  - Third sign in year 8 (after the second sign).
  - Fourth sign in year 10 (after the third sign).
  - Fifth sign in year 18 (after the fourth sign).
  - Sixth sign in year 36 (after the fifth sign).

The program incorrectly calculates the year as 180, which is not the correct answer. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
