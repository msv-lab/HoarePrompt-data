Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `start != end`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 4 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `t` is the same (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `m` must be greater than 3 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `end` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `s` is either 2 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` (not directly relevant to the loop condition but might affect the loop body)
   - `start` is decremented by 1 (relevant to the loop condition)
   - `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2[start]` is `s` (not directly relevant to the loop condition but might affect the loop body)
   - `inc` is -1 (relevant to the loop condition as it affects how `start` changes)
   - `mini` is the minimum between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini` (not directly relevant to the loop condition but might affect the loop body)

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - For the loop to continue, `start` must not be equal to `end`.
   - Given that `start` is decremented by 1, we need to ensure that `start` is still not equal to `end` after the decrement.

4. **Adjust the Relevant States**:
   - Since `start` is decremented by 1, we need to ensure that `start` is still not equal to `end` after this decrement.
   - To ensure `start` is not equal to `end` after decrementing, `start` must be at least 1 less than `end`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `start` must be such that it is not equal to `end` after decrementing by 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is either 2 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `start` must be at least 1 less than `end`, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`.**
