Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `match_c` is either True or False, `c` is the stripped input string from user, `template` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the current value of `a[i]` is added to the `template` list. Otherwise, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and `a[i].upper()` is appended to the `template` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template` contains either the value of `a[i]` (if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`) or the uppercase version of `a[i]` (if `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template` contains the uppercase version of `a[0]`. This is because if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `template` will contain the value of `a[0]` or its uppercase version as per the initial precondition, but since `i` is incremented to 1, `template` will retain the uppercase version of `a[0]` from the else part. If the condition `a[i] == b[i]` is false, `template` will still be the uppercase version of `a[0]` as specified in the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
