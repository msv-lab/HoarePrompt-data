Postcondition: `template` is a list of characters, `i` is an index within the list, and `match_a_b` is a boolean. If the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter, and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If the character at index `i` in `template` is not a lowercase letter, and either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (when converted to lowercase) matches the lowercase version of `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` remains `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` matches `template[i]` when converted to lowercase, `match_a_b` and the break statement remain unchanged.
