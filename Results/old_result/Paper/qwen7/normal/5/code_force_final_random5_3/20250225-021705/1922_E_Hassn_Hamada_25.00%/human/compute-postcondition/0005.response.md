Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Variables in the Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
```
The only variable involved in this condition is `size`.

### Step 2: Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute
The condition for the loop to execute is:
\[
(1 << size + 1) - 1 \leq number
\]
This means that for the loop to execute at least once, the expression `(1 << size + 1) - 1` must be less than or equal to `number`.

### Step 3: Analyze the Current State
The current state right before the loop is:
- `size` is 1

### Step 4: Calculate the Expression with the Given `size`
Substitute `size = 1` into the expression:
\[
(1 << (1 + 1)) - 1 = (1 << 2) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
\]
So, the condition becomes:
\[
3 \leq number
\]

### Step 5: Adjust the State
For the loop to execute at least once, `number` must satisfy the condition \(3 \leq number\).

### Final Answer
State: **`size` is 1 and `number` must be greater than or equal to 3**
