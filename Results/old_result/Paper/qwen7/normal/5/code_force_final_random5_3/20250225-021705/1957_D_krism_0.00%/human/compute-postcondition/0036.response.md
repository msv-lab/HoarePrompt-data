Output State: **`i` is 32, `j` is 0, `suf[j][0]` is 1**.

Explanation: The initial state has `i` as 32, `j` as 0, and `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1 if the bit at position `j` in `i` is 1, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1. Since the bit at position 0 in the binary representation of 32 (which is `100000`) is 0, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1, making `suf[j][0]` equal to 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
