Output State: **`test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of the function `func_1()` to the variable `test_cases`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `test_cases`. However, we know that `test_cases` now holds whatever value `func_1()` returns. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is not affected by this line of code.
