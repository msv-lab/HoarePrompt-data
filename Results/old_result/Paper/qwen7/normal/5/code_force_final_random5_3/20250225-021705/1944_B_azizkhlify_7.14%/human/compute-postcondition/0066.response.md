Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `ul` holds the last incremented value before exiting the loop, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged from their post-loop conditions, and if the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to 1, then `re` is equal to `k` and the element `a[i]` is appended to `res`; otherwise, `re` is equal to `k` and `res` remains unchanged.
