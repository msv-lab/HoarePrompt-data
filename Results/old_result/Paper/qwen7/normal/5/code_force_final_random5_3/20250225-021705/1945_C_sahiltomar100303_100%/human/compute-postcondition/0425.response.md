Output State: **`right` is `mid + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `trightZero` is either decreased by 1 or remains the same, `trightOne` must be less than \(\frac{n - mid}{2} + 1\), `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[mid + 1]` is not '0', `s[mid + 1]` is '0' if `tleftZero` is increased by 1, otherwise `s[mid + 1]` is not '0'**.

This means that `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1, while the other conditions and relationships remain the same. The value of `tleftZero` being increased by 1 does not affect the conditions involving `trightZero` and `s[mid + 1]` directly, but it influences the condition related to `tleftOne`.
