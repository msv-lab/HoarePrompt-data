Output State: **`leftZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` remains unchanged, `tleftOne` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `mid` is defined, `n` is defined, the current value of `i` is 1 and still less than or equal to `n` and greater than `mid`, `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 1**

Explanation: The code `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was initially 1, after executing this line, `rightZero` (or `trightZero`) becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
