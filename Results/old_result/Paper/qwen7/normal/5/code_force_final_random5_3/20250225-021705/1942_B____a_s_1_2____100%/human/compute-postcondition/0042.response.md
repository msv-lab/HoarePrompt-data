Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `mex` is the minimum value between the previous `mex` and `p[i]`, which is `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mex` to be the minimum value between its current value and `p[i]`, where `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`. Since `i` is `n-1`, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The value of `mex` is updated to reflect the minimum value between its original value and `p[n-1]`.
