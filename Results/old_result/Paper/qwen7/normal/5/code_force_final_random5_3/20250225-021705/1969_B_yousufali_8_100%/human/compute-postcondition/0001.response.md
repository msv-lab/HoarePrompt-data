State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` from the expression `range(t)`.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0), as `range(t)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
- Therefore, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `t` must be greater than 0.
