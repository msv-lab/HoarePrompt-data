Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list, `cur` is the next element in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition related to breaking the loop or if statement does not affect the current state since the increment operation is performed regardless of the condition.
