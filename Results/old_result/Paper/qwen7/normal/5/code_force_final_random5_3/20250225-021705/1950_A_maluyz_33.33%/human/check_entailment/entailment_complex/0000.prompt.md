Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be exactly equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is now `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of integers input by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split. Depending on the conditions met in the loop, the output printed during each iteration will be either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. After all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` sets of inputs, and the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will reflect the most recent input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` sets of three integers (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and prints one of three possible outputs ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') for each set based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. After processing all sets, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` represent the last set of integers input by the user. The function does not return any value.
