Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `i` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < t`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `w` remains the same.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces**.
