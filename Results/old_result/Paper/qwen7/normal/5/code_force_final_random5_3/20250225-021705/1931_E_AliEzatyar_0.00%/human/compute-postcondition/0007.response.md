Output State: **`num` is an integer where \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no changes were made to the variables `num` and `i`, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
