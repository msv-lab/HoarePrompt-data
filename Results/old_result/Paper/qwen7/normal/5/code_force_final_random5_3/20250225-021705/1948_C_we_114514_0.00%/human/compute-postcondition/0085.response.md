Postcondition: `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` and `(row1, row2)` are assigned from `test_case`, `j` is less than `n`, and the current value of `row1[j]` is '>'.

This postcondition indicates that after the execution of the if-else block, the list `results` remains unchanged as either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_first_row` is guaranteed to be True, `reachable_second_row` is also True, `j` is set to `n - 1`, `n` and `(row1, row2)` are still assigned from `test_case`, `j` is less than `n`, and the value at index `j` in `row1` is '>' (greater than sign).
