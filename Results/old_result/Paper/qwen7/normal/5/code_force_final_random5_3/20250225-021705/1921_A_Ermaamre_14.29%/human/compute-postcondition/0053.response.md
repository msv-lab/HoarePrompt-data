Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an input integer, `y3` is an input integer, `x4` is an input integer, `y4` is an input integer, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` to `res`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x4`, and `y4` remain unchanged. The conditions for `res` based on the values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4` are not affected by this line of code.
