Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` will be equal to the total number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, and `rightOne` will be equal to the total number of '1's in the same substring. Additionally, `trightZero` will be equal to `rightZero` and `trightOne` will be equal to `rightOne`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `mid` to `n-1` and counts the occurrences of '0' and '1'. Each time '0' is encountered, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented, and each time '1' is encountered, `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented. Since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`, `i` will finally be `n-1`. The counts of '0's and '1's in the specified substring are stored in `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne`.
