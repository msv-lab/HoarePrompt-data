The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, and there's no indication of which loop (if any) this `continue` statement belongs to, the state of the variables remains unchanged. 

Given the initial state, the values of `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, `ones`, `sum`, `sumInRange`, and `q` are all preserved. No new values are assigned to these variables.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are updated to new integer values obtained from input, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 2`.**
