Postcondition: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, `z_r` is 1 if `i` is 0, or `o_r` is 1 if `i` is not 0, and the following conditions hold: `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is 0; `ans` is 1.
