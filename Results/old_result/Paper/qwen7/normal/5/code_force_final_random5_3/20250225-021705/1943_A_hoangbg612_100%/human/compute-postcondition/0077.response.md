Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list, `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is 1, and either `num` is greater than `cur + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to `M[cur]`. The value of `cur` is equal to `num`. The conditions related to `num` and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `M[cur]` being set to `1`, while the other conditions and variables retain their original states.
