Output State: **`i` is `n`, `last_year` is the final value obtained by applying the update rule `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]` for each `i` from `1` to `n-1`, and `results` is a list containing a single string element which is the str representation of `last_year`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, updating `last_year` according to the rule `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i`.
- After the loop completes, `i` is set to `n` (as the loop runs up to `n-1`).
- The `results` list is appended with the string representation of the final value of `last_year`.
- The value of `last_year` is the result of the last update rule applied with `i` being `n-1`.
