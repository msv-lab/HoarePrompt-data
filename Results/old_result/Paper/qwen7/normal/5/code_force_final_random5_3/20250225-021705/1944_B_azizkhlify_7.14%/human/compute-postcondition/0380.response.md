Output State: **After all iterations, `i` is `2 * n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `ur` retains its original value.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached `2 * n`, indicating that every element in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1` has been processed. Since the loop breaks when `ul` equals `ur`, and given that `ul` is only incremented within the loop but not modified outside, `ul` will still be equal to `ur` upon exit. Therefore, `ur` retains its value from the last iteration where `ul` equaled `ur`, causing the loop to break.
