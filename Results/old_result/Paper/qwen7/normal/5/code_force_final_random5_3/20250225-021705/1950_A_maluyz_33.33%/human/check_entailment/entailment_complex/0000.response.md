Reasoning:
The provided function `func()` correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t` and ensures that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks the conditions:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a == b == c`, it prints "NONE".
   - If `max(a, b, c) == b`, it prints "PEAK".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" are correctly implemented, and the function handles all edge cases (like when all three digits are the same) appropriately.

Given the example input and output, the function produces the expected results. Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
