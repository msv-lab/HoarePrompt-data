Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the length of `s`, and `d` is the list with its last element removed.**

Explanation: The code `d.pop(n)` removes the element at index `n` from the list `d`. Given the initial state, `n` is the length of `s`, and `d[n]` is the final depth value. After executing `d.pop(n)`, the last element of `d` (which is `d[n]`) is removed. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
