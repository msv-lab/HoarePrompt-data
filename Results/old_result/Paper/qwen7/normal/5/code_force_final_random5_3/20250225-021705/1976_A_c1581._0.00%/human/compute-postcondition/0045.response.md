Output State: The function has executed all iterations of the loop without returning 'NO'. This means that none of the characters in the `password` string are digits, and therefore, `last_digit_index` remains -1.

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the `last_digit_index` variable still holds the value -1, indicating that no digit was found in the `password` string. The function did not return 'NO' during any iteration, implying that every character in the `password` string is not a digit.
