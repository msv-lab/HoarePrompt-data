Output State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `j` is increased by 1 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `t2` as `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. Given the initial state, `j` is increased by 1 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, and `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`. The value of `k` remains 2, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, and now `t2` is updated. The value of `j` might have been increased by 1 depending on the condition, but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing the values of `a` and `c`.
