Postcondition: `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is either '00' or '15', `m` is the minute part of the time input as a string, `h1` is '12' if `h` is '00' or '11' if `h` is '23', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM', and the condition `h != '22'` is true.
