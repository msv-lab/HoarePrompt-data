Output State: **`num` is an integer; `count_a[num]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value at index `num` in the list `count_a` by 1. Since `num` is an integer and it was already present in the list `count_a`, the value at `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. The initial state of `num` being an integer and its presence in `count_a` remains unchanged.
