Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical flaw in how it determines whether a template exists. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Template Validation**: The program checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]` for each position `i`. If this condition holds, it sets `l` to 'YES'. However, this does not guarantee that a valid template exists. A valid template should allow both `a` and `b` to match but `c` to not match.

2. **Overwriting `l` in Each Iteration**: The variable `l` is set to 'YES' inside the loop without considering the overall validity of the template across all positions. This means that even if the condition fails for just one position, `l` might still be set to 'YES' prematurely.

To fix this, you need to ensure that:
- Both `a` and `b` can match the template.
- `c` cannot match the template.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()

        # Check if a and b can match the template and c cannot
        can_match_a = True
        can_match_b = True
        cannot_match_c = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i].islower() and c[i] == a[i]:
                can_match_a = False
            elif a[i].isupper() and c[i].lower() == a[i]:
                can_match_a = False
            
            if b[i].islower() and c[i] == b[i]:
                can_match_b = False
            elif b[i].isupper() and c[i].lower() == b[i]:
                can_match_b = False
            
            if a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
                cannot_match_c = False
        
        result = 'YES' if can_match_a and can_match_b and not cannot_match_c else 'NO'
        print(result)
```

This version correctly checks the conditions for each string and ensures that the final result is accurate.
