### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down why the original assessment is accurate:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs `(n * (n - 1) // 2)` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is a correct step in modular arithmetic, but it is used incorrectly in the context of the problem.
   - The program then incorrectly uses this value `c` in the calculation of the expected sum without properly accounting for the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship values over excursions.

2. **Missing Probabilistic Considerations:**
   - The program assumes a uniform distribution of choices but does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a chosen pair increases over time. Each time a pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1, affecting the expected value for future choices.
   - The program should consider the probability of choosing a specific pair for each excursion and how this affects the expected value of the sum of friendship values. However, the current implementation does not handle these probabilistic aspects correctly.

3. **Incorrect Summation:**
   - The program sums the initial friendship values and multiplies by the modular multiplicative inverse, which does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation. The expected value should take into account the increasing friendship values over the k excursions, which the current implementation fails to do.
   - The expected value for each excursion should be calculated considering the probability of choosing a pair and the increase in friendship value over multiple excursions. The current implementation does not capture this dynamic aspect.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it fails to properly account for the probabilistic nature of the problem and the increasing friendship values over multiple excursions.
