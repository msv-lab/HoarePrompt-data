Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where a Bludger eliminates a player carrying the Quaffle. According to the problem description, if a player carrying the Quaffle is hit by a Bludger, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the player and the Bludger. However, the program does not account for this scenario. Specifically, the `func_1` function only handles movements and does not check for collisions with Bludgers. Additionally, the program does not update the Quaffle's position correctly when a player carrying it is eliminated by a Bludger. This oversight means the program may produce incorrect results in scenarios involving Bludgers.
