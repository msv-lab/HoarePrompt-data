Output State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2; `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`; `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. Since `i` is 2, `x` is set to 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is set to 2. The values of `b[2]` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
