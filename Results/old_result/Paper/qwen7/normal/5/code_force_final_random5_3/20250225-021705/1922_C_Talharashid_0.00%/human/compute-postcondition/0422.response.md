Output State: **`i` is 4, `m` is greater than 4, `start` is 3, `s` is 0, `s1` is abs(`d1[end]` - `d1[3]`), `s2` is abs(`d2[start]` - `d2[end]`).**

The code assigns the value of `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` to `s2`. Since `start` is 3 and `end` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `s2`, but we know it is calculated from the elements `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
