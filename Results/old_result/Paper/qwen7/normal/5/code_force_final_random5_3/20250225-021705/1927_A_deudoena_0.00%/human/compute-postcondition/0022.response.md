Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(inpstr)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - According to the problem statement, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, `i` is equal to the length of `inpstr` if the loop completes without finding a 'B'.
   - This implies that `i` starts from 0 and increments until it reaches the length of `inpstr`.

3. **Determine the State of `len(inpstr)`:**
   - The value of `len(inpstr)` is fixed and does not change within the loop. It represents the number of characters in the string `inpstr`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(inpstr)`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(inpstr)`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue until `i` reaches the length of `inpstr`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should start from 0 and increment until it reaches the length of `inpstr`.
- `len(inpstr)` remains constant and is the length of the string `inpstr`.

So, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `len(inpstr)` is the length of `inpstr`**
