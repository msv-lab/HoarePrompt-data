Output State: **`res` is updated by adding `q[eta[1001]] * (q[eta[1001]] - 1) * (q[eta[1001]] - 2) // 6` to its current value, `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[1001]]` to its current value, `eta` must have at least one element, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, and `j` is now 1002.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[1001]] * (q[eta[1001]] - 1) * (q[eta[1001]] - 2) // 6` to its current value.
- `rho` is updated based on the new value of `j`, which means `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]]` to its current value. Since `j` is now 1001, `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[1001]]` to its current value.
- The value of `eta` must have at least one element, and `eta_ln` is greater than 1, which remain unchanged.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now 1002.
