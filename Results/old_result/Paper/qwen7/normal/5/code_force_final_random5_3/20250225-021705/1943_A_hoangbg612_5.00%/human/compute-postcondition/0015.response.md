Output State: **`num` is greater than `cur + 1`; `cur` is equal to `num`; `M[cur]` is 1**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to `M[cur]`. Given the initial state where `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[cur]` becomes `1`. The conditions `num > cur + 1` remain true since no changes were made to `num` or the relationship between `num` and `cur`.
