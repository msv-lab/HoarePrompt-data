Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `k + m`, `m` must be equal to or greater than `k + m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation for each iteration, `a` is the sum of `f` for all iterations.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `k + m`. The condition `m` must be greater than or equal to `k + m` ensures the loop runs exactly `m` times. For each iteration, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from input, and `a` accumulates the value of `f` from each iteration, resulting in `a` being the total sum of all `f` values provided as input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is `s + c * (k + m) * c * (k + m) + c * a`, `i` is `k + m`, `m` must be equal to or greater than `k + m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation for each iteration, `a` is the sum of `f` for all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is `s + c * (k + m) * c * (k + m) + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `i` is `k + m - 1`, `m` must be equal to or greater than `k + m - 1`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation for each iteration, `a` is the sum of `f` for all iterations

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is `s + c * (k + m) * c * (k + m) + c * a + c * (k + m) * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `i` is `k + m`, `m` must be equal to or greater than `k + m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation for each iteration, `a` is the sum of `f` for all iterations




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
