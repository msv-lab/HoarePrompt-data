Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and it must be non-zero; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `x` is not defined yet; `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
