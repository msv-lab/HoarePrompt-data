Based on the initial state provided:

- `success` is `False`.
- `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters.
- `i` is `-1`.
- `bullets_needed` is `0`.
- `position` is the position of the last monster.
- `health` is the health of the last monster.
- `distance` is `abs(position)`.
- `time_available` is `distance`.

The `print('YES' if success else 'NO')` statement checks the value of `success`. Since `success` is `False`, the string `'NO'` will be printed.

Output: **NO**
