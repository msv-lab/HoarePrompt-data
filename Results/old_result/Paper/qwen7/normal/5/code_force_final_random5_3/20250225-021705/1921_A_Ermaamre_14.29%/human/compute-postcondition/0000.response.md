Output State: **`a` is an input integer**.

The code `a = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. Since the input is not specified in the initial state, the only thing we know is that `a` is now an integer value entered by the user. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
