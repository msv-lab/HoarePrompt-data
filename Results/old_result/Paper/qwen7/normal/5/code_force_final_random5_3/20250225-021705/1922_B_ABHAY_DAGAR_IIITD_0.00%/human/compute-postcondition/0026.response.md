Output State: **`cnt` is an integer greater than or equal to 3; `res` is `res` plus `cnt` times (`cnt` minus 1) times (`cnt` minus 2) divided by 6.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding to its current value the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Since `cnt` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, the value of `res` will be increased by this specific calculation. The initial value of `cnt` remains unchanged, and the updated value of `res` is the sum of its original value and the calculated expression.
