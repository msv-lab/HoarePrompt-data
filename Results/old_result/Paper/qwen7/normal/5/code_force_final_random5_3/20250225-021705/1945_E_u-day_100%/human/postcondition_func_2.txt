The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the length of the permutation, an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a list `arr` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation. It searches for the position of `k` in `arr` and performs a binary search to find the largest index less than `k` if `k` is not found. Finally, it prints either 0 or 1 based on whether `k` is found, and if 1 is printed, it also prints the indices of `k` and the largest index less than `k`.
