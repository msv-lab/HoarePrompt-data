Output State: **`M` is 2, `e` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `q` is the next character in the string `e`, `P` is 1 if the previous `q` was '+', otherwise `M` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `M` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. The other variables (`e`, `q`, and `P`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
