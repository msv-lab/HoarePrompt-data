You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand, and n is an integer representing the number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game. It is guaranteed that the length of the list a is n, and each integer in the list a is between 1 and n, inclusive, and appears at most twice.
def func_1(a, n):
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `count_a` will be a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appeared in the list `a`.
    #
    #In this specific case, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the dictionary `count_a` will contain each distinct number from the list `a` as a key, with the value being the total count of occurrences of that number in the list. Since we know that after 3 iterations, the last number encountered (`num`) is 2 and its count is 1, it means 2 is one of the numbers in the list `a`. However, without the full list `a`, we can't specify the exact counts for all numbers, but we know the process continues until every number in `a` has been processed.
    #
    #For example, if `a` was `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, then `count_a` would be `{1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1}` after the loop completes.
    max_score = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if num in count_a:
            if count_a[num] == 2:
                max_score += 1
        
    #State: The final value of `max_score` is 2, `num` is n, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `num` (which is now `n`) must be in `count_a` with a value of 2.
    return max_score
    #The program returns 2
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The list `a` represents the integers on the cards in your hand, and `n` represents the number of cards you and Nene receive at the beginning of the game. The length of the list `a` is `n`, and each integer in the list `a` is between 1 and `n`, inclusive, and appears at most twice. The function returns 2.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 2


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
