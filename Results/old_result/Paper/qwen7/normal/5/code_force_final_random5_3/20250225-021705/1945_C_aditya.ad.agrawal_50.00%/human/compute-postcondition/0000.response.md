Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input for `t`. This integer is assigned to the variable `t`, and the range constraints for `t` remain unchanged. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not affected by this line of code.
