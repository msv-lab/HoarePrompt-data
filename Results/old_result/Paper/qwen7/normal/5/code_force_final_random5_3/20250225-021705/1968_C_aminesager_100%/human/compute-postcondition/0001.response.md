The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero.

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive) and it is the integer input by the user, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is non-zero.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive) and it must be non-zero; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `x` is not defined yet.**
