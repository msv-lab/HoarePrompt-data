Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is an input integer.
- The current values satisfy `a < b < c`.

The print statement is simply `print('STAIR')`.

Output: **STAIR**
