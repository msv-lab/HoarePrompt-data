Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each number in the original `nums` list. The variable `res` is the cumulative sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the current `cnt`. The variable `t` remains 0 or negative, `n` is the input integer, `nums` is an empty list, and `cnt` iterates through all values in `num_of_lens.values()` as per the loop condition.

In simpler terms, `res` will be the sum of combinations calculated based on the frequencies of numbers in `nums` that appear 3 or more times, plus the product of combinations for numbers appearing 2 or more times and the sum of frequencies of other numbers. All other variables remain unchanged.
