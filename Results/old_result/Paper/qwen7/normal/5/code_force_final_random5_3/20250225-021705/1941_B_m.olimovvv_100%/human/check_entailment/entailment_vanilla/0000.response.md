Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array from index `0` to `a-3` (since the operation requires indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`).
   - For each index `i`:
     - If `b[i]` is negative, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop because it's impossible to have a negative value in the array after applying the operation.
     - It then updates the subsequent elements in the array based on the operation: `b[i+1] -= b[i]*2`, `b[i+2] -= b[i]`, and `b[i] -= b[i]` (which effectively sets `b[i]` to 0).
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are non-zero. If they are, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initial Check for Negative Values:**
   - The program correctly identifies if there is any negative value in the array during the iteration. If so, it immediately prints 'NO', which is correct because having a negative value means the array cannot be made all zeros with the given operations.

2. **Updating Array Elements:**
   - The operations performed (`b[i+1] -= b[i]*2`, `b[i+2] -= b[i]`) are consistent with the problem statement. However, the line `b[i] -= b[i]` is redundant since it just sets `b[i]` to 0.

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check ensures that the last two elements are zero, which is necessary because the operations only affect three consecutive elements at a time. If the last two elements are non-zero, it means the array cannot be fully reduced to zeros.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. It handles edge cases such as negative values and ensures that the final state of the array meets the criteria for being all zeros.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
