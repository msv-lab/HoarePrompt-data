Postcondition: `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is the hour part of the time input as a string, `m` is the minute part of the time input as a string, `h1` is either "01" or a string representing the hour in a 12-hour format, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either "AM" or "PM" depending on the value of `h`. If `h` is "01", then `h1` is "01" and `time` is "AM". Otherwise, `h1` is adjusted to represent the hour in a 12-hour format, and `time` is "AM" if `h` is not "12" and "PM" if `h` is "12".
