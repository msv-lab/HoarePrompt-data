Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Specifically, the program checks only the first and last rows and columns, which is insufficient to determine the possibility of making all squares the same color.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 3
BBB
BBB
BBB
```

In this case, all squares are already the same color (black), so the correct output should be "YES". However, the program will not detect this scenario because it only checks the first and last rows and columns. Since the first and last rows and columns are all 'B', the program incorrectly prints "NO".

Additionally, consider another test case:
```
3 3
BBW
BBW
BBW
```

Here, it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the operations described in the problem statement. However, the program will incorrectly print "NO" because the first and last rows and columns are not all the same color.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
