Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of the boxes (represented by `s1`) to the desired state (represented by `s2`).
2. The operations allowed are:
   - Adding a cat to an empty box.
   - Removing a cat from a non-empty box.
   - Moving a cat from one box to another.
3. The provided code correctly calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and removed (`cats_to_remove`) to achieve the desired state.
4. The logic in `func_1` sums up the positions where:
   - A cat needs to be added (i.e., `s1[i] == '0'` and `s2[i] == '1'`).
   - A cat needs to be removed (i.e., `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`).
5. The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of these two counts because each operation (addition or removal) can only change one box at a time.
6. The code correctly implements this logic and returns the result.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
