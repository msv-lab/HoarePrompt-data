Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postconditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `reachable_second_row` is `True`.
   - `reachable_first_row` is either `False` or remains unchanged depending on the value of `j`.

3. **Determine how the loop affects the variables**:
   - The variable `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be equal to `n - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to `n`.

5. **Update the conditions**:
   - `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged if it was `False` before the loop started, or it changes based on the new value of `j` (which is now `n`).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `j` should be updated to `n`.
- `reachable_first_row` should be checked based on the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`results` is an empty list, `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is either False or remains unchanged depending on the value of `j` (which is now `n`)**.

So, the final state can be summarized as:

State: **`results` is an empty list, `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is either False or remains unchanged, and `j` is `n`**.
