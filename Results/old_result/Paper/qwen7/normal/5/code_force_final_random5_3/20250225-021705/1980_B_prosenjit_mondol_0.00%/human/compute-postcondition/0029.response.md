Based on the initial state provided:

- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input split.
- `f` is now `f-1`.
- `k` is `f-2`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split, sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`.
- The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since no other variables or objects are being printed, and the string `'YES'` is explicitly printed, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
