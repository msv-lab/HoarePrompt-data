Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - It checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and rearranges the array accordingly.
   - After processing the array, it calls `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
   - Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints 'Yes' or 'No'.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the given list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - If the original list matches the sorted version, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Array Manipulation:**
   - The logic for splitting and inserting digits is flawed. The program attempts to split the previous element and insert the digits before and after the current element, but this does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem statement.
   - Specifically, the line `list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)` and `list1.insert(p, a % 10)` do not correctly represent the operation of splitting the digit and inserting it back into the array in the correct positions.

2. **Lack of Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might need to be split multiple times or where the array might already be sorted.
   - There is no mechanism to ensure that the array can be transformed into a sorted array through the allowed operations.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that we can transform the array into a sorted array by repeatedly applying the allowed operation. Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Function to split a number into its digits and insert them back into the list
    def split_and_insert(num, index):
        digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
        list1[index:index] = digits
    
    # Apply the operation until the array is sorted or it cannot be sorted
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        for i in range(len(list1)):
            if list1[i] >= 10:
                split_and_insert(list1[i], i)
                break
        else:
            print('No')
            break
```

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the original program, the provided solution is incorrect. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
