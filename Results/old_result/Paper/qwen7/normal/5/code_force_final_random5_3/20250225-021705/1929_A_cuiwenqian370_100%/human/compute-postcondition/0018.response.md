Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `index` is increased by `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `results` list has the return value of `func_1(array)` appended as its last element.**

Explanation: The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the end of the `results` list. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The `results` list now includes the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element.
