Output State: The value of `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The value of `n` is an input integer representing the number of iterations the loop will run. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. For each iteration, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, and `d` is set to `c / 2`. Depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d`, either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` is printed. The final state of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will depend on the inputs provided for each iteration, but they will be consistent with the logic inside the loop. No changes are made to `t` and `n` outside of the loop, and `i` will be updated to reflect the total number of iterations completed.
