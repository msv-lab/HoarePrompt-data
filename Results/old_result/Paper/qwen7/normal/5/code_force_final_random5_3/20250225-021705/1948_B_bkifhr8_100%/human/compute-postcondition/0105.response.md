Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `m` is 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user.
- `ans` remains False.
- `i` is -1.

The `print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])` statement will evaluate the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]`.

Since `ans` is explicitly stated to be `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][False]` will select the first element of the list `['NO', 'YES']`, which is `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **NO**
