The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a non-negative integer. It first processes the list to find the position `i` right after the last group of consecutive duplicates and sets `j` to the last index of the list. If all elements in the list are identical, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `j` (which is 0) and `i` (which is the length of `arr`), minus 1. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (`n - i - 1` and `j`) and 0, where `n` is the length of the array `arr`.
