Reasoning:
1. The program aims to calculate the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `n` for each test case.
2. To achieve this, the program precomputes the cumulative sum of digit sums for all numbers up to `2 * 10^5` and stores these values in the `values` list.
3. This precomputation is done in a loop that iterates from 1 to `2 * 10^5`, calculating the sum of digits for each number and updating the cumulative sum.
4. For each test case, the program uses the precomputed values to quickly find the required sum for the given `n`.
5. The input handling and output generation are correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Given the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the program appears to be correctly designed and implemented to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
