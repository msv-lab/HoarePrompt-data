Postcondition: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 19\), `password` is a string of length \(n-1\) consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing characters from the password that are not digits, `digits` is a list containing characters from the password that are digits, and `ch` is the first character of the remaining `password` string. After executing the if-else block, either the first character of the remaining `password` string is added to the `digits` list (if `ch` is a digit) or it is added to the `letters` list (if `ch` is a letter).
