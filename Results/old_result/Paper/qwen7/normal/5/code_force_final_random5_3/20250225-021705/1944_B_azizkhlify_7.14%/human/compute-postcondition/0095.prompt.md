Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n`, `ul` is `n`, `k` is `2 * k - n`, `re` is `k + 1`, and `res` is a list of elements from `a` where the corresponding index in `l` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is a non-empty list of elements from `a` where the corresponding index in `l` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `res`, as it is the source of the loop variable `i`.
   - After processing one element from `res`, `res` will have at least one fewer element (assuming the loop body does not add or remove elements from `res`).

### Conclusion
Since `res` is a non-empty list at the end of the previous iteration, after one iteration, `res` will still be a non-empty list, but it will have one fewer element. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

### Final Answer
State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is a non-empty list with at least one fewer element




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
