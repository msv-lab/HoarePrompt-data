Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is a new input string
   - `b` is the new input from the user
   - `c` is the input from the user
   - `l` is 'YES'

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (greater than 0).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is updated to 2.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.

6. **Consider other variables**: The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `l` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
