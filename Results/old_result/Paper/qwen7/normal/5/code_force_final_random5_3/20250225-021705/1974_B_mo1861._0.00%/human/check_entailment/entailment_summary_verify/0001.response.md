Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem**: The task is to decode an encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating a sorted string `r` of unique characters from `s` and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding character from the reverse of `r`.

2. **Analyze the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string itself.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`.
   - In `func_1`, a dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in the reverse of `r`. This mapping is done by sorting the unique characters of `b`, and then for each character in the sorted list, it maps it to the character at the corresponding position from the end of the sorted list.
   - Finally, the function iterates through each character in `b`, looks up the corresponding character in `char_map`, and constructs the decoded string `s`.

3. **Check the Logic**:
   - The creation of `char_map` ensures that each character in `b` is correctly mapped to its counterpart in the reverse of `r`. However, there is a critical issue in the implementation of `char_map`.
   - The function `func_1` sorts the unique characters of `b` and maps them to the reverse order of their positions in the sorted list. This approach assumes that the unique characters in `b` are the same as the unique characters in `s`, but this is not necessarily true. The unique characters in `b` might not include all the characters in `s`, and the mapping might not be consistent with the original encoding process.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`. The unique characters in `b` are `'c', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's'`, and the sorted unique characters are `'c', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's'`. The mapping would be:
- `'c'` -> `'s'`
- `'e'` -> `'r'`
- `'f'` -> `'o'`
- `'o'` -> `'f'`
- `'r'` -> `'e'`
- `'s'` -> `'c'`

However, the original string `s = "codeforces"` has additional characters like `'d'`, `'t'`, etc., which are not present in `b`. The function `func_1` does not account for these missing characters, leading to incorrect decoding.

To fix this, the function should create the auxiliary string `r` from the original string `s` and use it for the mapping. The current implementation only uses the unique characters from `b`, which can lead to incorrect results.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the decoding logic as described in the problem statement because it does not account for the unique characters in the original string `s`.

Final: **False**
