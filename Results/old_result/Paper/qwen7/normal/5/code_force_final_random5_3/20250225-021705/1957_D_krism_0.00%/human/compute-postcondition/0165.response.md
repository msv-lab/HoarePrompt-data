Output State: **`ans` is increased by `pre[4][0] * suf[4][1] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][0]`, `j` is 31, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `pre[31][0]` is 2, `pre[31][1]` is 32, and `suf[31][1]` is -32, `k` is 4, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, and `(c >> 31 & 1)` is 0**

Explanation:
- The line `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 31, `pre[31][0]` is updated to `32`.
- All other variables (`ans`, `c`, `pre[31][1]`, `suf[31][1]`, `k`, `y`, and `(c >> 31 & 1)`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
