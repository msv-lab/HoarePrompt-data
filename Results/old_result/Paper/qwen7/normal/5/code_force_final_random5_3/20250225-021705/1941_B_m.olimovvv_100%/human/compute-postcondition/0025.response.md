Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`, and `i` is \(a - 2\). If `b[i]` is less than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.
