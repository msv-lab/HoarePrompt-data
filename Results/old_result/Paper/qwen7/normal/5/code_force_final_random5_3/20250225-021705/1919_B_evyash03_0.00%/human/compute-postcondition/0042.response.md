The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `expression`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `length`, which is an integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000. The function calculates the balance by iterating through the `expression` string. It counts the number of iterations until the balance becomes greater than 0. If the balance is greater than 0 at any point, it returns the total number of iterations plus 1. If the balance never becomes greater than 0, it returns just the total number of iterations.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `expression` and an integer `length`. It iterates through the string, counting the number of iterations until the balance (determined by the presence of '+' and '-') is greater than 0. If the balance becomes greater than 0, it returns the count plus 1. Otherwise, it returns the count.**
