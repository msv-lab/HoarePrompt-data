Output State: **`k` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `j` is increased by 1 if `t2` is greater than `t1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the maximum value between `t1` and `t2`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `j` is increased by 1 only if `t2` is greater than `t1`, otherwise it remains unchanged. The values of `t1` and `t2` also remain as they were, just their maximum value is added to `ans`.
