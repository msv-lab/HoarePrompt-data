Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user. The count of 'U' in `arr` is odd, results is a list containing 'yes'**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('yes')` appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was not defined before, it is assumed to be a new list created by this operation. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
