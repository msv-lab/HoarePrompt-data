Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array \(a\) derived from the string \(s\). The penalty is calculated based on the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.
2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
   - It then splits the string into parts using '-' as a delimiter.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string and its length.
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string, tracking the balance of '+' and '-' characters and counting the number of times the balance goes negative.
   - The function returns the count of such occurrences plus 1 if the final balance is positive, otherwise just the count.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly counts the number of times the balance of '+' and '-' goes negative.
   - This count corresponds to the optimal number of splits needed to minimize the penalty.
   - The logic to add 1 if the final balance is positive ensures that the last segment is included in the count, which is necessary for the correct calculation of the penalty.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum penalty.
   - The function `func_1` accurately calculates the number of splits required.
   - The output matches the expected behavior as described in the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
