Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\).
   - `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`.
   - `r` is the last element of `vals`.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of `prod` divided by each element `r` in `vals` (excluding the last element).
   - `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is calculated as `prod / vals[i]` for each element `vals[i]` in `vals` except for the last element `r`.
   - The `print` statement joins all elements of `vprod` into a single string with spaces between them.

Given the above, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod`.

**Output:** **vprod (where vprod is a list of products of prod divided by each element in vals excluding the last element)**
