Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` is decremented by 1.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is equal to the length of list `a`.
   - `a` is sorted in reverse order.
   - `c` is a list of integers entered by the user and sorted in reverse order.
   - `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`.
   - `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`.
   - `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration of the loop.
   - `i` and `j` are both equal to the length of list `a`.
   - The sets of `a` and `c` contain only one unique element and the first elements of `a` and `c` are equal.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Since `a` and `c` both have only one unique element and their first elements are equal, both lists `a` and `c` must be identical.
   - Therefore, `a[0]` and `c[0]` are the same value.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))`.
   - Given that `a` and `c` are identical, `max(c)` and `min(c)` are both equal to `a[0]`.

4. **Calculation:**
   - `abs(a[0] - max(c))` simplifies to `abs(a[0] - a[0]) = 0`.
   - `abs(a[0] - min(c))` also simplifies to `abs(a[0] - a[0]) = 0`.
   - Therefore, `max(0, 0) = 0`.

Based on this analysis, the print statement will output `0`.

Output: **0**
