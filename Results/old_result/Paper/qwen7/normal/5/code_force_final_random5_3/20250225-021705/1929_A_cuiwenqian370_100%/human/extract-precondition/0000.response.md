Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and array is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. The function func_1(array) is expected to return an integer representing the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.**
