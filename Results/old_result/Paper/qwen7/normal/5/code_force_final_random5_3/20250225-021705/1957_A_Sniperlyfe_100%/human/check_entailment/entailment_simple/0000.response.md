### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It also correctly reads the number of sticks (`n`) and their lengths.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary. This step is correct and ensures that each stick length is counted accurately.

3. **Polygon Formation**: The program attempts to calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. It currently divides the frequency of each stick length by 3 and sums these values. This approach is incorrect because it assumes that each polygon requires exactly three sides, which is not necessarily true. A polygon can have any number of sides, and the correct approach would be to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the frequencies and then divide this GCD by the number of sides of the polygon (starting from 3).

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, but due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`, the output will not be accurate.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the program is not correct because it does not accurately determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
