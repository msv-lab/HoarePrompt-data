Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `a` is `int(a)`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b`.**

Explanation: The code `list1.sort()` sorts the list `list1`, which contains strings obtained from splitting the input string `b`. The sorting is done in-place, meaning `list1` is updated to its sorted version. All other variables remain unchanged.
