Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is at least 5, meaning `m` can be any integer greater than or equal to 5.
- `a3` is the second integer from the first input converted to an integer.
- `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a4`.

The `print('no')` statement simply prints the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
