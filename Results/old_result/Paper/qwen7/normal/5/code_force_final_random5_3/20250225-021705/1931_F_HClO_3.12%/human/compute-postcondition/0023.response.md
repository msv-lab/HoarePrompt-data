Output State: **m must be greater than the total number of iterations (which is m-2), and input has been received but not stored or used for these iterations.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. The precondition remains unchanged.
