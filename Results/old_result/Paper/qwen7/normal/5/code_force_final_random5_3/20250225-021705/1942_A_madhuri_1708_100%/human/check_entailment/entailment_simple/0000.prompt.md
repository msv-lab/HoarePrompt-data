Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.
