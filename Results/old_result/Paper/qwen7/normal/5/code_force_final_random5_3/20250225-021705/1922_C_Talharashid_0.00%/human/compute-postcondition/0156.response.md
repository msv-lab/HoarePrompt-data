Output State: `start` is `initial value - m`, `end` is `initial value - m - 1`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is `m`, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations:
- The variable `start` will be set to the initial value minus the total number of iterations (`m`).
- The variable `end` will be one less than `start`.
- The variable `inc` remains -1.
- The variable `mini` retains the minimum distance found throughout the loop's execution.
- The variable `s` remains 0 as it is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration.
- The variable `i` equals the total number of iterations, which is `m`.
- The variable `m` remains the input integer `m`.
- The variable `s2` and `s1` will hold the absolute differences calculated based on the conditions within the loop, specifically `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` and the corresponding value from the other branch.
