Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates into a list `a`.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates into a list `x`.
4. It calculates the difference `dx` between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which should represent the side length of the square.
5. It prints the square of `dx`, which is the area of the square.

Given the problem statement, this approach is correct because:
- The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, so the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will give the side length.
- Squaring this difference gives the area of the square.

The program does not need to check if the y-coordinates also form the same difference, as the problem guarantees that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
