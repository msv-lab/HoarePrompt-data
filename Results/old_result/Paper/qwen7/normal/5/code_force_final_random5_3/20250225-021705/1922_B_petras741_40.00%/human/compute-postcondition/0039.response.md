Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `eta` must have at least one element, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its current value. The initial increment of `res` by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` remains unchanged. The conditions on `eta` and `eta_ln` also remain valid.
