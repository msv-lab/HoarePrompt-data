Postcondition: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a`, and `n` is incremented by either 1 or 2. If `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, then `c` has an additional element determined by the last digit of `a[i]` and the integer part of `a[i] / 10`, and `n` is incremented by 1 or 2 based on the relationship between `y` (integer part of `a[i] / 10`) and `c[n - 1]`. If `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10`, then `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer value of `a[i]` divided by 10, and `n` is incremented by 1 or 2 based on whether `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If neither condition is met, `n` is incremented by 1.**
