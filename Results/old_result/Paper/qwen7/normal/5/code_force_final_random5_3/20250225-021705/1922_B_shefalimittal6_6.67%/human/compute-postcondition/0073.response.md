Postcondition: `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`; if `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged; regardless of the value of `cnt`, `res` is further increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`.
