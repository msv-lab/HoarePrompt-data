Output: **Draw**

Explanation:
- The initial state does not provide any specific values for the variables `pres`, `pb`, `ps`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `p`, `a`, or `maxa`.
- The only explicitly defined value is `i`, which is equal to `len(pres)`. Since `pres` is not defined, `i` remains undefined.
- The variable `rem` is explicitly defined as 0.
- The variables `maxs` and `maxb` are defined as the maximum values in `ptss` and `ptsb`, respectively, but since these lists are not defined, their values are also undefined.
- The print statement simply outputs the string 'Draw', regardless of the values of other undefined variables.

Therefore, the output is simply the string 'Draw'.
