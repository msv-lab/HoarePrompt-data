Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`; `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to it. The precondition states that `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged. Now, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` under the same condition. The values of `num_of_lens` and `total_sum` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
