Reasoning:
- The annotated program logic has some flaws in its approach to determining if there exists a valid template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not.
- The current implementation incorrectly assumes that if `c` does not match either `a` or `b`, then it should print 'YES'. However, this is not sufficient to conclude that a valid template exists.
- The logic should check if there's at least one position where `a` and `b` have different characters compared to `c`. If such positions exist, then a valid template can be constructed by making those positions match the differing characters between `a` and `b`.

Given the above points, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the existence of a valid template based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
