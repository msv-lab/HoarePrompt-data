Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `c` is an integer from the input.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`.

The expression `round(a * d)` will be evaluated and printed. Here, `d` is `c / 2`, so the expression becomes `round(a * (c / 2))`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `c` are not specified, we can only express the result in terms of these variables.

Output: **round(a * (c / 2))**
