Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of constraints and relationships. It takes a positive integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `q` (where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5), an array `c` of length `n` with each element being a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and `q` queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` (where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n). For each query, it returns the sum of elements in the subarray from index `l_i` to index `r_i` in the array `c`.**

This functionality describes a function that processes multiple test cases, each containing an array and queries. For each query, it calculates and returns the sum of the specified subarray in the given array `c`.
