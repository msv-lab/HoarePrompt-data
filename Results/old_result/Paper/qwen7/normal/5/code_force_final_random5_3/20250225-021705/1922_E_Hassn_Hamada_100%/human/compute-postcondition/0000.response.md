Output State: **number is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers where all elements are in the range [-10^9, 10^9]**.

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any executable statements that modify the variables `number` or `sequence`. It only contains a docstring which describes the function's purpose and arguments. Therefore, the initial states of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged.
