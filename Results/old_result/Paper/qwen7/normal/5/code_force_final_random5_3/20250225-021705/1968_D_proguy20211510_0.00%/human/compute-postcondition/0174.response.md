The code `maxa = max(a)` calculates the maximum value in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `maxa`. The other variables (`i`, `rem`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), and `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`.

Output State: **`i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**
