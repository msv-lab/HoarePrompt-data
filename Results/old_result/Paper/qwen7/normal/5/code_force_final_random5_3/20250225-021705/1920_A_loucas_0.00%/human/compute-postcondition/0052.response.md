Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`.
2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `max(big) + 1` to `min(less)` (exclusive).
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `max(big) + 1`.
   - If `i` is not in `no`, the loop breaks.
   - If `i` is in `no`, no action is taken regarding the break statement.

Given these points, let's analyze what needs to happen for the loop to execute one more time:

- For the loop to continue, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(max(big) + 1, min(less))`.
- Since `i` is currently `max(big) + 1`, it needs to be incremented by 1 to check the next value in the range.
- If `i` is not in `no`, the loop will continue; otherwise, it will break.

Since the loop continues as long as `i` is within the specified range and not in `no`, we need to ensure that `i` is still within the range and not in `no`.

### Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Increment `i`**: The next value of `i` should be `max(big) + 2`.
2. **Check if `i` is in `no`**: If `i` is not in `no`, the loop will continue. Otherwise, it will break.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `max(big) + 2`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` is not in `no`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `max(big) + 2`, if `i` is not in `no`, we continue the loop**.
