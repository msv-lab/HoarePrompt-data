Output State: **`s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a list of words from `b`.**

Explanation: The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of words based on whitespace as the delimiter. The original values of `s` and `list2` remain unchanged. The new list `list1` contains the words from the string `b`.
