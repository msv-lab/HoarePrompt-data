Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `ans`, `i`, or `nums`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no new assignments or operations are performed, the values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged, and `nums` retains its current state, which is not equal to its sorted version.
