Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given as:
   ```
   while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
   ```

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `list[0]` must be greater than 0
   - `list[1]` is decreased by `list[0]`
   - `list[2]` must be greater than 0
   - `list[i-1]` is 0 (Since `i` is 1, `list[i-1]` is `list[0]`)

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
     - `list[i] > 1`
     - `list[i - 1] > 0`
     - `list[i + 1] > 0`

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `i` is 1, so `list[i]` is `list[1]`.
   - `list[i - 1]` is `list[0]`, which must be greater than 0.
   - `list[i + 1]` is `list[2]`, which must be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `list[0]` must be greater than 0 and `list[2]` must be greater than 0, these states need to be adjusted.
   - `list[1]` is already adjusted as it is decreased by `list[0]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `list[0]` and `list[2]` to ensure they are greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1; `list[0]` must be greater than 0; `list[1]` is decreased by `list[0]`; `list[2]` must be greater than 0; `list[1]` is 0**
