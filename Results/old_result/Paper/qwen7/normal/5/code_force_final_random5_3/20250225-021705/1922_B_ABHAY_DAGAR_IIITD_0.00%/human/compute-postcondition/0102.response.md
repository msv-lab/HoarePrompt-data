Output State: **`total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`; `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

Explanation: The code `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value. The precondition states that `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`, and `res` is either increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` or `next_cnt * (next_cnt - 1) * (next_cnt - 2) // 6` depending on whether `next_cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. However, since the code only updates `res` with `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, we reflect this in the output state. The other conditions regarding `res` remain unchanged, but the specific update is now reflected in the output state.
