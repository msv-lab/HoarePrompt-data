Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in nums:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `x` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `nums` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `nums` must contain at least one element. If `nums` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `nums` is initially an empty list, we need to ensure that `nums` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `x` will be the first element of `nums` when the loop starts its first iteration.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `nums` must contain at least one element.
- `x` will be the first element of `nums` when the loop starts its first iteration.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element of `nums`**
