Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is the hour part of the time input as a string, `m` is the minute part of the time input as a string.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string `s` (which is in the format "hh:mm") using `:` as the delimiter and assigns the resulting parts to `h` and `m`. Both `h` and `m` are converted to strings. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
