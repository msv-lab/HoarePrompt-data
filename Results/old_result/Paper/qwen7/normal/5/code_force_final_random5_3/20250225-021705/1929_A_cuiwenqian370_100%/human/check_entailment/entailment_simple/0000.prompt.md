Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers where the length of the list is at least 2 and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\).
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `beauty` is the sum of absolute differences between every consecutive pair of elements in the `array`, `array` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of the `array`.
    #
    #In Natural Language: The final value of `beauty` will be the sum of the absolute differences between every pair of consecutive elements in the `array`. This summation starts from the first element to the second, then includes the difference between the second and third, and so on until the last pair of consecutive elements in the array. The variable `i` will be one more than the length of the `array` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of absolute differences between every pair of consecutive elements in the `array`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and array is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. The function func_1(array) is expected to return an integer representing the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by the sum of `2 * n + int(data[index]) + (t - 1) * n`, `results` list contains the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, where `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]` for each iteration, and `n` is `int(data[index])` for each iteration.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must still be greater than 0, indicating that there were enough elements in the `data` list to complete all iterations. The `index` variable will have been incremented by the total amount calculated, which includes the sum of `2 * n` for each of the `t-1` iterations plus `int(data[index])` for each of the `t` iterations. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(array)` for each of the `t` iterations, with each `array` being a list of integers derived from the `data` list according to the specified slicing.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is set such that there are no remaining elements in `data` that can be used to create any more arrays, and `results` list contains exactly `t` elements.
