Output State: **`i` is `n`, `a` is a list starting with `[1000]` and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding value from the list `T` up to `n-1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of list `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `t = t - 1` simply subtracts 1 from the value of `t`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `t` is now `t - 1`.
