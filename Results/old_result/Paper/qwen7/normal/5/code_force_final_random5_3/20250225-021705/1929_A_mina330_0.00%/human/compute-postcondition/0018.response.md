Output State: **`ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is `ntest`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, and `n` is an input integer obtained from user input.**

In this output state, the variable `n` has been updated to the value obtained from user input, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
