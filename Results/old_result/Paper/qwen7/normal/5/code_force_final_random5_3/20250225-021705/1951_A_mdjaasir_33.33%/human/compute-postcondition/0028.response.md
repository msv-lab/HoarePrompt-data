Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `a` is either exactly 2 with the count being even and satisfying specific conditions (index of the first '1' exists and the character immediately following the first '1' is not '1', or the index of the first '1' does not exist or the character immediately following the first '1' is '1'), or the count of '1's in the string `a` is greater than 2 or even.
