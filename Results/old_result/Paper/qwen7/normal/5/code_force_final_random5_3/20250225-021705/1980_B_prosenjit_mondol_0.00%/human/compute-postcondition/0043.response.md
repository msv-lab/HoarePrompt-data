Postcondition: `num` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer obtained from the input split, `f` is now `n - 3`, `k` is `n - 3`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 3`. If `a[k] < x`, the condition is true and remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition is false and remains unchanged.
