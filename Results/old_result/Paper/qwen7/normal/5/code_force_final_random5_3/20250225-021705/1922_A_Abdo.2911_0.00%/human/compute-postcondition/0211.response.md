Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`, and the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration unless it is reset to 0.
   - The loop checks if `template[i].islower()` is true and if `c[i] != template[i]`.
   - If `c[i] != template[i]` is true, `i` is set to the next index where the condition is not met or the loop breaks.
   - If `c[i] != template[i]` is false, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - If the else part is executed, `i` is reset to 0, and if `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, the loop breaks.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration unless it is reset to 0, we need to consider both scenarios:
     - If `i` is incremented by 1, then `i` will be `i + 1`.
     - If `i` is reset to 0, then `i` will be 0.

4. **Consider the Conditions**:
   - If `i` is incremented by 1, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - If `i` is reset to 0, `i` will be 0.
   - The other variables (`match_a_b` and `match_c`) remain unchanged as per the postconditions.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The new state should reflect the possible values of `i` based on the conditions described.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration can be either:
- `i` is `i + 1` (if `i` was not reset to 0)
- `i` is 0 (if `i` was reset to 0)

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as follows:

**State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` remains False, and `i` is either `i + 1` or 0**.
