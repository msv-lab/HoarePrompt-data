Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `q` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers obtained from the remaining space-separated inputs, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

The code initializes a list `ones` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, or `nums`.
