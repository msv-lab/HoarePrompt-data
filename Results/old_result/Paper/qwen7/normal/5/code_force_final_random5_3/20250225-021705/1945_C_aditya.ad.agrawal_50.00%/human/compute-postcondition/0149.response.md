Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, `z_r` is 0, `o_l` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` is 1, and the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` still hold true.**

Explanation: The line `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos` (which is 1) to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `z_r`, `o_l`, and the conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
