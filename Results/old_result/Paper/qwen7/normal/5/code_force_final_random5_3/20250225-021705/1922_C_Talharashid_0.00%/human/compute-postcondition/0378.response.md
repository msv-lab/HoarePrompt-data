Postcondition: `i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is 0, `start` is decremented by 1 if `start - 1` is greater than `-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and `11111111`. The current value of `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
