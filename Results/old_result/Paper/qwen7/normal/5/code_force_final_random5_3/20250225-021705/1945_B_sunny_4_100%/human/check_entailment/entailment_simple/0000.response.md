Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to determine if it correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Variables Initialization**: For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.
3. **Calculation**: It calculates the number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously using the formula `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`. This formula is derived from the observation that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation that are still visible plus 2 (for the initial fireworks from both installations).
4. **Output**: It prints the result for each test case.

The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is correct because:
- `m // a` gives the number of fireworks from the first installation that are still visible.
- `m // b` gives the number of fireworks from the second installation that are still visible.
- Adding 2 accounts for the initial fireworks from both installations.

Given that the logic follows the problem statement accurately and the formula used is correct, the program should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
