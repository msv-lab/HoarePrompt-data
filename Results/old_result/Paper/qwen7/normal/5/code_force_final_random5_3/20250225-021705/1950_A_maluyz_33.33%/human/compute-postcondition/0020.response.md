Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer**.

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
