Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` remains the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is either 3 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) + 1`, `start` is now `start + inc`, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` and `d2[start]` are either `s`, which is 3 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) + 1`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is `min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini), `d2[start]` is `s`**.

In this output state, the variable `d2[start]` has been updated to the value of `s`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
