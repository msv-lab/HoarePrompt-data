Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Variable Initialization and Calculation**:
   - `N` is correctly initialized with the number of outcomes for each test case.
   - `vals` is correctly populated with the multipliers for each outcome.
   - `prod` is calculated as the product of all multipliers in `vals`. This step is necessary but may not be optimal for large products due to potential overflow issues with large numbers.

3. **Product Calculation**:
   - `vprod` is calculated as the product of `prod` divided by each element in `vals` (excluding the last element). This step is mathematically sound and aligns with the requirement to ensure the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

4. **Validation**:
   - `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`. This ensures that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, the program correctly prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists. This is correct.

5. **Output**:
   - If `den` is greater than zero, the program prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces, which represents the valid bet distribution. This is also correct.

Given the above analysis, the program logic matches the problem requirements and handles all cases correctly as described.

Correctness: **True**
