Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is 2**

Explanation: The line `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Given that `leftZero` was initially 1, after executing this line, `leftZero` becomes 2. The other variables (`i`, `mid`, and `s[i]`) remain unchanged.
