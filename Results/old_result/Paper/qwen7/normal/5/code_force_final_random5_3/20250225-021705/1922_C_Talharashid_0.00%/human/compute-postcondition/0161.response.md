Output State: **`start` is `initial_value - m`, `end` is `initial_value - m - 1`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is the input integer `m`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the initial values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, `mini`, `s`, `i`, `m`, `d2`, `s2`, and `s1` remain unchanged.
