Output State: **`h1` is '08', `m1` is equal to the string `m` from the user's input split by ':', `time` is an empty string**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'08'` to the variable `h1`. The values of `m1` and `time` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `m1` is still equal to the string `m` from the user's input split by `':'`, and `time` remains an empty string.
