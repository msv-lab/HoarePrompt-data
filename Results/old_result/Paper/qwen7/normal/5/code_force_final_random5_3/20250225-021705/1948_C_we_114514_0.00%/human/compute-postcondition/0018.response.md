Postcondition: `results` is an empty list, `reachable_first_row` is either True or False depending on the condition, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is either equal to `n` minus 1 or less than `n` minus 1, and `row1[j]` is '>' if `j` equals `n` minus 1, otherwise `row1[j]` is not '>' and `row2[j]` is '>'.
