Output State: **`cnt` is an integer, and `res` is updated to `res` plus `cnt` times (`cnt` minus 1) times (`cnt` minus 2) divided by 6, provided that `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Given the initial postcondition, `total_count` is assumed to be `cnt` minus 2. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt - 2)`. This calculation is only performed if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.
