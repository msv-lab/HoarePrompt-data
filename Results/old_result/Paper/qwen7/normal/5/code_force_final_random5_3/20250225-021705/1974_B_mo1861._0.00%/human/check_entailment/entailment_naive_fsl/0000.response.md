Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. Specifically, the issue lies in how the `char_map` is constructed. The mapping should pair each character in the sorted unique set of characters in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding symmetric character. However, the current implementation incorrectly maps characters to their symmetric positions.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`. The unique characters in `b` are `s, e, r, o, f, d, c`, which are sorted as `c, d, e, f, o, r, s`. According to the problem description, the symmetric mapping should be:
- `c` -> `s`
- `d` -> `r`
- `e` -> `e`
- `f` -> `f`
- `o` -> `o`
- `r` -> `d`
- `s` -> `c`

However, the current implementation maps these characters incorrectly. For instance, `c` is mapped to `s` instead of `s` being mapped to `c`. This results in the wrong decoded string.

To fix this, the `char_map` should map each character to its symmetric counterpart directly without the need for converting ASCII values. Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    for i in range(len(unique_chars)):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[~i]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map.get(c, '')  # Use get to handle cases where the character is not found
    return s
```

With this correction, the program should correctly decode the encoded strings according to the problem description.
