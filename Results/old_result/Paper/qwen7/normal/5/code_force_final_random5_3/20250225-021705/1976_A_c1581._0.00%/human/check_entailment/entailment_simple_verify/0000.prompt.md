You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: The function has executed all iterations of the loop without returning 'NO'. This means that none of the characters in the `password` string are digits, and therefore, `last_digit_index` remains -1.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the `last_digit_index` variable still holds the value -1, indicating that no digit was found in the `password` string. The function did not return 'NO' during any iteration, implying that every character in the `password` string is not a digit.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The `last_digit_index` variable still holds the value -1, indicating that no digit was found in the `password` string. The function did not return 'NO' during any iteration, implying that every character in the `password` string is not a digit. Additionally, the `digits` list is either empty or contains elements that are already sorted.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The `last_digit_index` variable still holds the value -1, indicating that no digit was found in the `password` string. The function did not return 'NO' during any iteration, implying that every character in the `password` string is not a digit. Additionally, the `digits` list is either empty or contains elements that are already sorted. The `letters` list is sorted.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both letters and digits are present in the password and the digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, consider the password `123abc`. According to the problem description, this password should be classified as "NO" because the digits `1`, `2`, and `3` are not sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the current implementation will incorrectly classify this password as "YES".

To fix this, the program needs to check the sorted order of digits after ensuring that there are no digits coming after letters. Here is a modified version of the `func_1` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if there is a digit after a letter
    last_digit_index = -1
    for i, char in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    
    # Check if digits are sorted in non-decreasing order
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if letters are sorted in non-decreasing order
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    
    return 'YES'
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly identifies passwords that do not meet the criteria for having digits sorted in non-decreasing order.
