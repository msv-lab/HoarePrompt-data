Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` remains the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is either 3 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) + 1`, `start` must be at least 1 less than `end`, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is `min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)**

Explanation: The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` was either 2 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, after incrementing by 1, `s` becomes either 3 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
