Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0.
   - Since `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not affect the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `test_cases`, which must remain greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
