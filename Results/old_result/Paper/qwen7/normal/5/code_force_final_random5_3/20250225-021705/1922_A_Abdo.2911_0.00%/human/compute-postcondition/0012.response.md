Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `template` contains either `a[0]` or `a[0].upper()` depending on the condition of the if statement. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` (with `i` being 0), then `a[0]` is appended to `template`. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, `a[1].upper()` is appended to `template`.
