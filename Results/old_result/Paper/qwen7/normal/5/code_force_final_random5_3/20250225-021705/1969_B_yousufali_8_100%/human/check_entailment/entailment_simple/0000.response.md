Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through each character of the binary string `s`.
   - It counts the number of '1's encountered (`n`) until a '0' is found.
   - When a '0' is found after at least one '1', it adds `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`).
   - This logic correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string in non-descending order. Each time a '0' appears after a sequence of '1's, it represents a cyclic shift operation that costs `n + 1`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` which processes the binary string and prints the result.
   - The state of `t` is maintained correctly, ensuring that the loop runs exactly `t` times.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program structure ensures that for each test case, the correct binary string is processed by `func_1` and the results are printed.
   - There are no logical errors or missing steps in the provided code.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly implements the solution to find the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order.

Correctness: **True**
