You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():

        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):

    #State: Output State: The function has executed all iterations of the loop without returning 'NO'. This means that none of the characters in the `password` string are digits, and therefore, `last_digit_index` remains -1.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the `last_digit_index` variable still holds the value -1, indicating that no digit was found in the `password` string. The function did not return 'NO' during any iteration, implying that every character in the `password` string is not a digit.

        return 'NO'

    #State: The `last_digit_index` variable still holds the value -1, indicating that no digit was found in the `password` string. The function did not return 'NO' during any iteration, implying that every character in the `password` string is not a digit. Additionally, the `digits` list is either empty or contains elements that are already sorted.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The `last_digit_index` variable still holds the value -1, indicating that no digit was found in the `password` string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary information (`n` and `password`) for each case.

2. **Processing Each Password:**
   - For each password, it separates the characters into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It checks if any digit appears after a letter.
   - It sorts both `digits` and `letters` and checks if they match their expected sorted forms.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns 'NO'; otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - This part is correct. The program correctly reads all input and processes it for multiple test cases.

2. **Separating Digits and Letters:**
   - The logic to separate digits and letters into two lists is correct.

3. **Checking Digit Order:**
   - The check for whether a digit appears after a letter is correct. It uses `last_digit_index` to keep track of the most recent digit position and ensures that any subsequent character is a letter, which would violate the condition.

4. **Sorting and Validation:**
   - The program correctly checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where the password consists only of digits or only of letters correctly.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions. There are no logical errors or missing checks that could lead to incorrect results.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
