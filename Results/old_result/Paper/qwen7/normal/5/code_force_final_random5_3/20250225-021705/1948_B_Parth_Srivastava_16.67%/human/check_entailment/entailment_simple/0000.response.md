Reasoning:
- The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic inside `func_1()` does not properly handle the splitting of numbers into their digits and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.
- The main issues are:
  1. The logic for splitting numbers into digits is flawed. It only handles the case when the number is greater than 10 and splits it into its last digit and the integer part, but it does not handle the full process of breaking down the number into its individual digits.
  2. The comparison between `c` and `sorted(c)` is incorrect. The program checks if `c` is already sorted, but it should check if the original array `a` can be transformed into a sorted array through the operations described.
  3. The program does not actually transform the array `a` to check if it can be sorted through the allowed operations. Instead, it creates a new list `c` based on certain conditions and checks if `c` is sorted.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to sort the array using the allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**
