Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and it is the integer input by the user; `n` is an integer, and it is the integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `x` is not defined yet.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `n`, `a` is a list starting with `[1000]` and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding value from the list `T` up to `n-1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of list `a` separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `i-1` elements from the list `T`, `result` is a string containing the cumulative sums separated by spaces.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
