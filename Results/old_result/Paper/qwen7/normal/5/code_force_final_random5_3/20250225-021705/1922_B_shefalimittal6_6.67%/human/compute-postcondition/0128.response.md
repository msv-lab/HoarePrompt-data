Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns information or a result based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of non-negative integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the provided constraints.
