Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Specifically, `node_u` and `node_v` will point to the two nodes that have the smallest edge weight among all the edges that were processed during the loop. The `dsu.min_edge` attribute will reflect the minimum edge weight within the connected component that `node_u` belongs to, and `_min_edge` will hold the overall minimum edge weight found during the entire execution of the loop.

    #This is printed: [node] ... [node] (where [node] represents the nodes visited during the DFS traversal starting from node_u)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a graph represented by vertices and weighted edges using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum spanning tree (MST). It first constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph and sorts the edges in descending order of their weights. Then, it iteratively processes each edge, merging connected components and updating the minimum edge weight found so far. Finally, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes involved in the MST to determine the connected component size and prints the minimum edge weight along with the number of nodes in the DFS traversal.

#Function 7:

    if (colors[curr] == 1) :
        return path

    #State: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, and `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored. The color of the vertex `curr` is not 1.

    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are unvisited neighbors (color != 2) of the current vertex (`curr`) that are not the parent vertex. For each such neighbor, the DFS function is called recursively. If at any point the DFS call returns a non-empty result containing `node_v`, the function will return that result. If no such result is found after all possible paths are explored, the function will eventually return `None`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, the output state will be determined by whether `node_v` was found in any of the DFS paths starting from the initial `curr` vertex and exploring through its neighbors, excluding the parent vertex, until all possible paths are exhausted. If `node_v` is found in any of these paths, the function will return that path (as a list of vertices). If `node_v` is not found in any path, the function will return `None`.
    colors[curr] = 2
    return []
    #The program returns an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph starting from the current vertex (`curr`). It maintains a list (`path`) representing the current path of vertices being explored and uses a `colors` array to keep track of the visiting status of each vertex. The function returns one of the following:
1. The list `path` if the current vertex is already visited.
2. A set `res` containing the return value from the DFS function call if `node_v` is found in any path.
3. An empty list if no valid path is found after exploring all possibilities.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of an undirected weighted graph described by integers n, m, u, v, and w as specified in the problem description.
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. This is because the loop continues to run as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0, and there is no operation within the loop that changes the value of `test_cases`. Therefore, if the loop runs for 1, 2, or 3 times, it implies that `test_cases` was initially greater than 0 and remained so throughout the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each representing an undirected weighted graph. It iterates through the specified number of test cases (stored in `test_cases`) and calls `func_6()` for each iteration. After completing all iterations, the function ensures that `test_cases` remains greater than 0, indicating that all specified test cases were successfully processed. The function does not return any value.
