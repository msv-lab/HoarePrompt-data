Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` tries to find the first and last unique elements in the array and calculates the cost based on their positions.
   - However, it does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal by choosing any subarray and setting its values to a common value.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is flawed because it only checks for the first and last unique elements and does not consider other possible operations that could minimize the cost.

2. **Operation Cost Calculation**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements equal by performing at most one operation where all elements between indices `i` and `j` are set to a value `x`.
   - The current implementation does not explore all possible subarrays and their costs.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Identify the unique elements in the array.
- For each unique element, calculate the cost of making all elements equal to that element using the allowed operation.
- Return the minimum cost among these calculations.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    
    # Find all unique elements in the array
    unique_elements = set(arr)
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    for val in unique_elements:
        cost = 0
        start = 0
        for end in range(n):
            if arr[end] != val:
                cost += end - start
                start = end + 1
        cost += n - start
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    print(min_cost)
    t -= 1
```

This corrected program:
- Identifies all unique elements in the array.
- Iterates through each unique element and calculates the cost of making all elements equal to that element.
- Returns the minimum cost among these calculations.
