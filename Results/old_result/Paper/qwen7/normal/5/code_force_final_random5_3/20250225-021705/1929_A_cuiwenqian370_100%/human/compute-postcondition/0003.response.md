Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 1**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `index` to 1. The values of `t` and `data` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, and `data` is still a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
