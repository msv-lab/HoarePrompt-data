Postcondition: `i` is the fourth element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 1`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)` and `b_d` is greater than the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `z_r` and `o_r` remain unchanged.
