Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `ur` is incremented by 2. Since `i` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. Also, `r[a[i] - 1]` was previously equal to 2, and this value remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `ur`.
