Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: It uses a dictionary (`num_of_lens`) to count the frequency of each unique number in the input list `nums`.
3. **Combination Calculations**:
   - For numbers that appear 3 or more times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 out of these occurrences using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - For numbers that appear 2 or more times, it calculates twice the product of the number of ways to choose 2 out of these occurrences and the sum of the frequencies of all other numbers using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

The logic seems sound for forming a non-degenerate triangle, which requires the triangle inequality theorem to hold true (the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side). However, the program does not explicitly check this condition. Instead, it relies on the combinatorial approach to ensure that the chosen sticks can potentially form a triangle.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program correctly implements the combinatorial logic to count the valid triplets without explicitly checking the triangle inequality. This approach is valid because if the counts are such that they can form a triangle, the combinatorial method will accurately count those valid triplets.

Therefore, the program is correct in terms of the logic and the combinatorial calculations it performs.

Correctness: **True**
