Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
2. The solution checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
3. If the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, it calculates the mean amount of water per container.
4. It then iterates through the list of water amounts, accumulating the difference between each amount and the mean.
5. If at any point the accumulated difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water amounts, and the function returns 'NO'.
6. If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it implies that it's possible to balance the water amounts, and the function returns 'YES'.

Given the logic and the provided code, the function correctly implements the required algorithm. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
