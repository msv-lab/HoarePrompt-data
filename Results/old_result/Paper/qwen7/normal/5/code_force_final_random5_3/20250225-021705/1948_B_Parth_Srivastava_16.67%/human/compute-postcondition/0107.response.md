Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by n integers (2 <= n <= 50) within the range [0, 99]. For each test case, it returns a result based on the provided data.**
