Output State: **Postcondition: `a` is an array that includes at least the elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`, `n` must be less than or equal to 5, `i` is now `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional structure it is nested in, but it does not change the values of the variables `a`, `n`, or `i`. The conditions and values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
