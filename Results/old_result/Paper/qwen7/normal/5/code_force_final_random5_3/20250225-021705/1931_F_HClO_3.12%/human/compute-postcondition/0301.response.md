Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `t` must be greater than `current_index + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer (`a1`), `m` is the second integer from the input split and converted to an integer (not included in the list `l1`), and an empty line is read, we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` splits the input into a tuple, where `a1` is the first element (which was `a3` in the initial state) and `l1` is a list containing the rest of the elements (which were `l3` in the initial state). The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. An empty line is read, and the loop continues.
