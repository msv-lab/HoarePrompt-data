### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, pairs of friends, and the number of excursions.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\) and calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, denoted as `c`.

2. **Calculating the Modular Inverse:**
   - The line `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` correctly computes the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program initializes `s` and `a` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each of the `m` pairs of friends, reading `u`, `v`, and `f` (where `f` is the friendship value).
   - It correctly adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program enters a loop for `k` excursions.
   - Inside this loop, it updates `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` is intended to account for the probability of choosing a specific pair of friends over `k` excursions. However, the formula is incorrect. The correct approach would be to consider the expected value contribution of each pair of friends individually.

5. **Correct Expected Value Contribution:**
   - For each pair of friends `(u, v)` with friendship value `f`, the expected value contribution after `k` excursions is `k * (k + 1) / 2 * f`.
   - The program should accumulate these contributions for all pairs of friends.

6. **Output:**
   - The output is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Calculate the expected value contribution for each pair of friends.
- Accumulate these contributions in `s`.
- Print the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * i * c * m + c * a) % M
        print(s)
```

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation:** Correct.
- **Friendship Value Sum:** Correct.
- **Expected Value Calculation:** Incorrect (as explained above).
- **Final Output:** Correct.

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the expected value contribution for each pair of friends. The provided solution needs to be modified to correctly accumulate the expected value contributions.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
