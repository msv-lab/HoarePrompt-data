### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions. A subarray is considered "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
   - The sums of elements in both arrays are equal.
   - No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
   - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The given solution uses prefix sums and counts of 1s in the subarray to determine if the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to check if the subarray can be made "good".

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly initializes `ones` and `sum` arrays using prefix sums.
   - For each query, it calculates the count of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the subarray (`sumInRange`).
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray can be made "good". This condition simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic used in the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is correct. It effectively checks if the sum of the subarray can be adjusted by changing some elements to make the subarray "good".
   - The code handles edge cases where `l == r` by printing "NO" immediately.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
