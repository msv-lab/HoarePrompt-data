Output State: **`t` is 5, `m` is 4, `x` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n //= 2`, which means `n` is divided by 2 and the result is then assigned back to `n`. Given the initial state where `n` must be at least 1 and initially was an integer (let's assume it was 2 or more since it must be at least 1 and the division results in 1), `n` becomes 1 after the operation. The values of `t`, `m`, `x`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.
