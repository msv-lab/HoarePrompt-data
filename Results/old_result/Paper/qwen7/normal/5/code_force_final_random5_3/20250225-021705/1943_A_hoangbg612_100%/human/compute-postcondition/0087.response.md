Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list, `cur` is the value of `num`, `M[cur]` is 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. Otherwise, `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to `M[cur]`. The value of `N`, `cur`, and the condition for breaking the loop remain unchanged.
