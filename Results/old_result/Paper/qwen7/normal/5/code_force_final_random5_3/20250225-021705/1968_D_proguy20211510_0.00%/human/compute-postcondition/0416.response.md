Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is a list containing the value `ss + s[i]`, `sb` is `sb + b[i]`, `ss` is 0, `s` is a non-empty list, `len(s)` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `pres.append(ss + s[i])` appends the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. Since `ss` is 0, the value appended to `pres` is simply `s[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
