Output State: **`tleftZero` is either 0 or 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `rightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is either 1 or 4, and `leftOne` is 3 if `s[i]` is not '0'**.

Explanation: The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially 2 (if `s[i]` is not '0'), after executing the code, `leftOne` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
