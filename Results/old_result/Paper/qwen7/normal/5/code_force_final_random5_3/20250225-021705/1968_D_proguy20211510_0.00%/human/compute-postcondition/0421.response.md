Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i] + b[i-1]` and `sb + b[i] + b[i-1] + b[i-1]`, `sb` is `sb + b[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i]`, `s` is a non-empty list, `len(s)` is greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`**

Explanation: 
- The value of `sb` is updated by adding `b[i]` to it, so `sb` becomes `sb + b[i]`.
- Since `i` is `i_prev + 2`, the previous value of `i` (which is `i_prev`) was used to access elements in the lists `preb` and `sb`. Therefore, `preb` should now contain the values `sb + b[i-1]` and `sb + b[i-1] + b[i-1]` updated to include `b[i]`, making them `sb + b[i] + b[i-1]` and `sb + b[i] + b[i-1] + b[i-1]`.
- The values of `pres`, `ss`, `s`, and `len(s)` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
