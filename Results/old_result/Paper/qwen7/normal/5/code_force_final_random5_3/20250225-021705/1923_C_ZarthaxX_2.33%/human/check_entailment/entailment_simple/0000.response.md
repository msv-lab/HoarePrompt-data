Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions. A subarray is good if there exists another array \(b\) such that:
   - The sums of the subarray and \(b\) are equal.
   - No element in the subarray equals the corresponding element in \(b\).
   - All elements in \(b\) are positive.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If a subarray contains at least one 1, we can always construct a corresponding \(b\) where all elements are 1 except for one element which is adjusted to make the sum equal.
   - If a subarray does not contain any 1s, it cannot be good since no \(b\) can satisfy the conditions with all elements being positive and different from the original subarray elements.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code initializes arrays `ones` and `sum` to keep track of the cumulative counts and sums.
   - It iterates through the input array `nums` to populate these arrays.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray can be good by examining the count of 1s and the sum of the subarray.
   - The logic correctly identifies whether the subarray can be good based on the presence of 1s and the sum condition.

4. **Specific Checks**:
   - The code correctly handles the edge case where \(l = r\) by printing "NO".
   - The logic for checking if the subarray can be good is sound:
     - If there are no 1s in the subarray, it cannot be good.
     - If there are 1s, it can potentially be good, and the condition \(2 \times \text{count of 1s} + (\text{length of subarray}) - \text{count of 1s} \leq \text{sum of subarray}\) ensures the possibility of constructing \(b\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The code logic matches the problem requirements and correctly determines if a subarray is good based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
