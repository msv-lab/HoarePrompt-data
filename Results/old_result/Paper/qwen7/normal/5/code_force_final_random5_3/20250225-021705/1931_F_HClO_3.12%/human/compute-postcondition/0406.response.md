Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers, `l2` has had the element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the element `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
