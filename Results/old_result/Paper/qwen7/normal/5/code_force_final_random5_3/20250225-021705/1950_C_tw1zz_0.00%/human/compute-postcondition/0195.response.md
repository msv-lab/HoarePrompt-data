Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is the hour part of the new time input as a string, `m` is the minute part of the new time input as a string, `h1` is calculated based on the new `h` as described, `m1` is equal to the new `m`, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is not '12' and 'PM' if `h` is '12'.**

Explanation: The code `h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))` takes an input from the user in the format "hh:mm" and splits it into two parts: `h` (hour) and `m` (minute). These are then converted to strings and assigned to the variables `h` and `m`. The values of `s`, `t`, `h1`, and `time` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new values of `h` and `m` are used to determine the new `h1` and `time` according to the given rules.
