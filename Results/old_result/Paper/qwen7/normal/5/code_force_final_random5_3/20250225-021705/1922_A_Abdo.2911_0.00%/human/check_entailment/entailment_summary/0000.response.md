Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It constructs a template from string `a` by converting differing characters to uppercase. This part of the logic seems to be aimed at ensuring that characters in `a` and `b` that do not match are marked as potentially different in the template.
4. The program then checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template. Specifically, it ensures that if a character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must match; if the template character is uppercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must not match the lowercase version of the template character.
5. Finally, it checks if `c` does not match the template. If `a` and `b` match and `c` does not match, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program appears to follow the rules correctly and should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
