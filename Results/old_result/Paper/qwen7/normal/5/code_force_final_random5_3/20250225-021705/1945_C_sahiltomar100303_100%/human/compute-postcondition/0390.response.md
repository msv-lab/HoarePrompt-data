Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid`, `leftZero` is `trightZero + rightZero`, `rightOne` is `trightOne + rightOne`, `s[left - 1] != '0'`, and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`; either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state. The precondition that `s[left - 1] != '0'` and the inequality involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` must still hold true after the operation.
