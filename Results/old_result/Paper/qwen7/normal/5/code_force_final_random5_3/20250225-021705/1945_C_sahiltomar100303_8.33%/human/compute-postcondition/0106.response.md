Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`, and either `tleftZero` or `trightOne` must meet the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)`; `tleftZero` is incremented by 1; `trightZero` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements `trightZero` by 1. The conditions involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by this operation. The values of `right` and `tleftZero` also remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
