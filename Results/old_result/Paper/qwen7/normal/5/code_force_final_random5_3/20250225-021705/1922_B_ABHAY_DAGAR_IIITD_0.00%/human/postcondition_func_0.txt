The function processes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. For each tuple, it calculates the total number of unique triplets of sticks that can be formed based on the counts of each exponent value. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the total count of unique triplets for each set of inputs provided.
