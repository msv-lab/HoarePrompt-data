Output State: **`sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 2`, `l` and `r` are updated to new integer values obtained from input, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `sumInRange` to the value of `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. This does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `onesInRange`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `ones`, and `sum` remain unchanged from their initial states.
