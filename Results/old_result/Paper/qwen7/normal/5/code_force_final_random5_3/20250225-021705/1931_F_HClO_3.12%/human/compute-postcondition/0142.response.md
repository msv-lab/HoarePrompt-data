Postcondition: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to int, and the next pair `(a4, l4)` is valid where `l4` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a4`. If `l3` is not a list of integers excluding `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
