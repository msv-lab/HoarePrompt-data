Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a non-empty list of elements from `a` where the corresponding index in `l` is 1.

This means that `res` contains elements from the list `a` at positions where the corresponding value in the list `l` is 1. However, the specific values of `res` and the list `a` are not given, but we know that `res` is non-empty.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

Here, `i` is the index of the current element being processed in the list `res`. Since `res` is non-empty, there must be at least one index `i` that satisfies the condition (i.e., the corresponding value in `l` is 1).

Given this information, the print statement will output the index `i` of the current element in `res`.

Output: **i (where i is the index of the current element in the non-empty list res)**
