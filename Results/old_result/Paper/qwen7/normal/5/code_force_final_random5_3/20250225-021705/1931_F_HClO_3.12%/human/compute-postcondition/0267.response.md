Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable involved here is `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `m`**: From the postcondition, we know that `m` is initially set such that `m - 2` is a non-negative integer (since the loop runs `m - 2` times). This means `m` must be at least 2.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop condition depends on `m`, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Given the postconditions and the loop structure, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be at least 2**
