Output State: **The final value of `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `l` will contain all such divisors.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. The list `l` will contain all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`. This is because the loop iterates over all odd numbers up to the square root of `x`, checking if they are divisors of `x`. If a divisor is found and it is less than or equal to `k`, it updates `ans` and adds it to the list `l`.
