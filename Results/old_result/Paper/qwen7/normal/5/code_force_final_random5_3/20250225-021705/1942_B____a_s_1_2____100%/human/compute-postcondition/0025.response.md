Output State: **`p[i]' is equal to `mex - a[i]', `mex' is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]'**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. The value of `p[i]` remains unchanged, and `mex` is updated accordingly. Therefore, `mex` is now the minimum between its original value and `p[i]`.
