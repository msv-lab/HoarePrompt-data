Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` has an additional element which is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends to list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. Since `i` is less than `n`, the index `i - 1` is a valid index for both `a` and `T`. The value of `a` is updated by adding this new element, but the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
