Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` is defined to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s` in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments the count of '1's (`one`).
     - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the cost. This logic is based on the observation that each '0' that appears after the first '1' will require a separate cyclic shift operation to move it to its correct position.
4. **Output**: The function returns the calculated cost, which is printed for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the logic in `func_1` seems to correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The approach is sound and aligns with the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
