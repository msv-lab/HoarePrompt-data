Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1, making it equal to 1 (assuming it started at 0). Since `i` was initially set to the first element of `arr`, incrementing `pos` means `i` now refers to the second element of `arr`.
