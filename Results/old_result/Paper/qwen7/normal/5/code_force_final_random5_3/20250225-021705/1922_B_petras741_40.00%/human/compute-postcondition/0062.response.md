Postcondition: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, `res` accumulates the contributions from each iteration of the loop, where each contribution is the sum of two terms: `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `rho` accumulates the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for each `j` from 1 to 1000.**
