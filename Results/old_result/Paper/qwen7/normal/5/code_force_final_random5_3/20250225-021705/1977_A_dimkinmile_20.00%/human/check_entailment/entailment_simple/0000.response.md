### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes respectively.
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `n` (number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (desired number of cubes).
4. **Output**: 
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".
5. **Edge Cases**: The logic handles all edge cases where `n` and `m` are within the specified ranges (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the program logic matches the requirements perfectly. It correctly determines whether it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Correctness:
**True**
