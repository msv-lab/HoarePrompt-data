Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The provided solution attempts to construct such an array using a recursive approach.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It calculates the size of the sequence needed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a binary representation-like approach to build the sequence, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`.
   - The base case (`number == 0`) correctly returns 0.
   - The loop constructs the sequence by appending values and adjusting them based on the recursive call results.
3. **Recursive Calls**:
   - The function recursively calls itself with updated parameters, ensuring that the sequence is built correctly.
   - The modifications to the sequence ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is counted accurately.
4. **Output Handling**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one using the `func_1` function.
   - The length of the resulting sequence and the sequence itself are printed as required.

Given the execution summary and the analysis of the code, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
