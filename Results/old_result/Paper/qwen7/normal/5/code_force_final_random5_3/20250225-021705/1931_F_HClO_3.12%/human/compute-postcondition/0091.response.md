Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, the value of `val` is an empty list.**

The code `val = []` initializes an empty list named `val`. This operation does not affect the values of `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, or `n`. It only creates a new list `val` which is initially empty. Therefore, the conditions regarding `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
