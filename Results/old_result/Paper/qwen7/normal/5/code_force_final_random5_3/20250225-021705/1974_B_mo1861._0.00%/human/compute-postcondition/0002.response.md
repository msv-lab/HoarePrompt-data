Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains three objects: `i`, `c`, and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop logic**:
   - `b` is passed to `set()`, which removes duplicate elements from `b`.
   - `sorted()` sorts the unique elements of `b`.
   - `enumerate()` assigns each element of the sorted set to `(i, c)` where `i` is the index and `c` is the character.

3. **Determine the initial state required for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the set `b` must contain at least one unique element after being processed by `set()` and `sorted()`.
   - The variable `i` will be the index of the current element in the sorted set.
   - The variable `c` will be the current character from the sorted set.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `char_map` is an empty dictionary, it doesn't directly affect the loop's execution but might be relevant for other parts of the program.
   - The key requirement is that `b` must contain at least one unique element after being processed by `set()` and `sorted()`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are related to the object `b`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`b` is a list or iterable that must contain at least one unique element**.
