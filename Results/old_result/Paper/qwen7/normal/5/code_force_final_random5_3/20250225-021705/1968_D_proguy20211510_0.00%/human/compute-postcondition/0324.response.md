Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(pres)`, `rem` is 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is not yet calculated, `ptss` is not yet calculated, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two boolean variables `founds` and `foundb` to `False`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
