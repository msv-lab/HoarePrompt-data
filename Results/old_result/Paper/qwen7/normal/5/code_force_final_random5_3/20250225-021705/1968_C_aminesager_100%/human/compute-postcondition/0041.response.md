Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so the condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` has an additional element which is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, if `i` was less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` will now be equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1.

5. **Check the New Condition for the Loop:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n`.

6. **Adjust the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously `k` (where `k < n`), then `i` will now be `k + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
   - `a` will have another element added to it, but this does not affect the loop condition directly.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` will have another element added to it, but this is not part of the loop head and thus not adjusted here.

So, the new state is:

**`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` has an additional element which is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]`.**

However, to clearly show the updated value of `i`:

**`i` is `i + 1` (which is less than `n`), `n` is an input integer, `a` has an additional element which is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]`.**

To present it in the required format:

State: **`i` is `i + 1` (which is less than `n`), `n` is an input integer, `a` has an additional element which is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]`.**
