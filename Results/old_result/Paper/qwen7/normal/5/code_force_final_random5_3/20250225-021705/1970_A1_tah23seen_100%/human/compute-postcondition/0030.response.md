Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, and then by the negative first element of each tuple.
- `i` is the first element of the next tuple in `d`.
- `j` is the second element of the next tuple in `d`.
- `ans` is the sum of the elements `s[i]` plus the value of `s[i]`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for (i, j) in d:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `j`, and `(i, j)` from the tuple `d`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more tuples in `d`.
3. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` and `j` will be updated to the next tuple in `d`.
   - `ans` will be recalculated based on the new values of `i` and `j`.

### Adjusting the States
- Since `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element and then by the negative first element, the next tuple in `d` will be the next pair `(i, j)`.
- `i` will be the first element of the next tuple.
- `j` will be the second element of the next tuple.
- `ans` will be updated to include the sum of the elements `s[i]` plus the value of `s[i]`.

### New State
Given that `d` is sorted and we need to move to the next tuple, the new state will be:
- `d` remains the same (as it is a list and does not change within the loop).
- `i` is updated to the first element of the next tuple in `d`.
- `j` is updated to the second element of the next tuple in `d`.
- `ans` is updated to include the sum of the elements `s[i]` plus the value of `s[i]`.

### Final Answer
State: **`d` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, and then by the negative first element of each tuple, `i` is the first element of the next tuple in `d`, `j` is the second element of the next tuple in `d`, and `ans` is the sum of the elements `s[i]` plus the value of `s[i]`.**
