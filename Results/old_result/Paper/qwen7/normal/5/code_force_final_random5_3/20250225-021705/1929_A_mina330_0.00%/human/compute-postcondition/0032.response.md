Output State: **`ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is `ntest`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `kq` is the sum of the elements at even indices subtracted from the sum of the elements at odd indices in the list `a`, `i` is `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the next input to the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
