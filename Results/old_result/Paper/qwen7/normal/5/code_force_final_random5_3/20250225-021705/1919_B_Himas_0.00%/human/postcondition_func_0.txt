The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `s`, a string `e` consisting of '+' and '-' characters, and calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' or any other characters in `e`. It prints this difference for each test case. The function implicitly takes the number of test cases `t` as input, along with the values of `s` and `e` for each test case. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
