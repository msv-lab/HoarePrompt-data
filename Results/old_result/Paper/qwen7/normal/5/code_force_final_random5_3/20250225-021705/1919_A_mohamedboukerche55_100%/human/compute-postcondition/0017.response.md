Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is defined as \(i + 1\). However, since no specific value for `i` is given, we can only say that `i` is incremented by 1.
- `s` is an updated input string.
- `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`.
- `b` is the second integer from the split string `s`.

The `print('Bob')` statement simply prints the string "Bob" regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **Bob**
