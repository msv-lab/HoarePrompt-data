Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` and is now equal to `i + 1`, `preb` includes the appended value `sb + b[i]` and now equals `sb + b[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` appends the value of `b[i]` to `sb`, making `sb` now equal to `sb + b[i]`. Since `i` was initially `i + 1` and must be less than `len(s)`, after executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. The value of `preb` is updated to include the new appended value, which is `sb + b[i + 1]`.
