Postcondition: **reachable_first_row is False, j is less than n, n is the first element of test_case, test_case is updated to contain the next element in test_cases, row1 is the second element of test_case, row2 is the second element of test_case. If j is less than n-1 and the current value of row2[j] is '>', then reachable_second_row is True. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.**
