Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, respectively, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftOne` is `1`, and `right` is `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Since `tleftOne` was previously equal to `0` (as per the initial state), after executing this line, `tleftOne` becomes `1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
