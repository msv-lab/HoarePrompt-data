Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers entered by the user.
- `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`.
- `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the steps:

1. `x` is a list with 4 elements, where each element is the first element from one of the 4 lists in `a`.
2. `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

The expression `dx * dx` calculates the square of `dx`.

Since the exact values of the integers entered by the user are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `dx`. However, we know that `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the square of this difference.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x)**
