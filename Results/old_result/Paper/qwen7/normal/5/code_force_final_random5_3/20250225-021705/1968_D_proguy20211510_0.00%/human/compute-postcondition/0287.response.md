Output State: **`i` is 3, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptss`. This new value is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, and `ptsb` contains the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, the value added to `ptss` is specifically `pres[3] + rem * s[3]`. The values of `i`, `rem`, `ptsb`, `pres`, and `s` remain unchanged except for the addition of the new element to `ptss`.
