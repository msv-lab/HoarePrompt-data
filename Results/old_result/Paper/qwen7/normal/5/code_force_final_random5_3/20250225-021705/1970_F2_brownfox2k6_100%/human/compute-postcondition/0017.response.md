Based on the initial state provided, `out` is a list that must have at least one element. However, the variables `t` and `p` are not defined in the initial state. Since they are not explicitly defined, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the output will include the placeholders `t` and `p`.

Output: **t, p, 'ELIMINATED'**
