Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds true. If the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is equal to `b`, then the maximum value remains unchanged. Otherwise, the maximum value is not equal to `b`.
