Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an undirected weighted graph described by integers n, m, u, v, and w. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases where each test case involves an undirected weighted graph defined by specific integers, but no explicit return value is stated.
