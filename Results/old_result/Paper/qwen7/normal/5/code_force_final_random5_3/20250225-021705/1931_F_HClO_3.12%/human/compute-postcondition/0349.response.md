Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be at least 5.
   - `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`.
   - `idx2` is either `-1` or `i`.
   - `p1` is either `1` or `0`.
   - `p2` is either `0` or `1`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `n` remains unchanged, and `i` becomes `i + 1`.

5. **Determine the new values**:
   - `idx1` and `idx2` can remain the same or change based on the loop body, but since no specific changes are mentioned, they can stay as they were.
   - `p1` and `p2` can remain the same or change based on the loop body, but since no specific changes are mentioned, they can stay as they were.
   - `m` remains at least 5.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.

6. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i+1` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1` or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
