Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `a` is now an integer derived from splitting the input and converting it to an integer and appending it to the `no` list, `iterable2` is 2, and `innerLoop` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `a` is an integer derived from splitting the input and converting it to an integer, it is added to the `no` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
