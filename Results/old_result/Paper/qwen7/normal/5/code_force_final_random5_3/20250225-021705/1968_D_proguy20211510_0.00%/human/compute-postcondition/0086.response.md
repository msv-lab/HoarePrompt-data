Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 1, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the maximum value of `maxa` if the condition `foundb` is true and `founds` is also true, otherwise `b` contains the element `a[pb - 1]` or `p[pb - 1]`, and `pb` is equal to `p[pb - 1]` if the condition `a[pb - 1] == maxa` is met, otherwise `b` contains the element `p[pb - 1]; `s` is a list with `maxa` appended.**

Explanation: The code `s.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `s`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the values of `i`, `k`, `b`, and `pb` remain unchanged from their initial states.
