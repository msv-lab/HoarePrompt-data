Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` step-by-step.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it calls `func_1(list1)` to check if the array is sorted.
   - If the array is not sorted and the previous element is greater than the current element and is at least 10, it performs the digit-splitting operation.
     - It removes the previous element from the list.
     - Inserts the tens digit of the removed element before the current position.
     - Inserts the units digit of the removed element at the current position.
   - After potentially performing the digit-splitting operation, it again checks if the array is sorted using `func_1(list1)`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It returns `True` if the list is sorted, otherwise `False`.

### Evaluation Using Function Summary

- The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted. This part is correct.
- However, the main logic of the program does not correctly implement the digit-splitting operation. The program attempts to split the digits only when the previous element is greater than the current element and is at least 10. This is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be made sorted.

### Example Analysis

Consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
```

- Initial array: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
- First iteration: `p = 1`
  - `list1[0] = 12` and `list1[1] = 3`. Since `12 > 3`, the condition `list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10` is true.
  - Remove `12` and insert `1` and `2` in the appropriate positions: `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`
- Second iteration: `p = 2`
  - `list1[1] = 2` and `list1[2] = 3`. The array is now sorted.
- The program prints "Yes", which is correct.

However, consider another input:
```
3
4
45 12 3 67
```

- Initial array: `[45, 12, 3, 67]`
- First iteration: `p = 1`
  - `list1[0] = 45` and `list1[1] = 12`. Since `45 > 12`, the condition `list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10` is true.
  - Remove `45` and insert `4` and `5` in the appropriate positions: `[12, 4, 5, 3, 67]`
- Second iteration: `p = 2`
  - `list1[1] = 4` and `list1[2] = 5`. The array is still not sorted.
- Third iteration: `p = 3`
  - `list1[2] = 5` and `list1[3] = 3`. Since `5 > 3`, the condition `list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10` is false, and no further operations are performed.
- The program prints "No", which is incorrect because the array can be sorted by splitting `45` and `67`.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the digit-splitting operation and may fail to sort the array in some cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
