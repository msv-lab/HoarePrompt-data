Output State: **`a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is an integer equal to `a[1]` divided by 10, `c` is a list with one element `y`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `c`. Since `y` is already defined as the integer division of `a[1]` by 10, appending `y` to `c` means `c` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
