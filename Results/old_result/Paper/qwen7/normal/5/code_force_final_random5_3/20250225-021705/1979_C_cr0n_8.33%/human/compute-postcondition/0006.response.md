Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers that must have at least two elements, `prod` is the product of 1 and the first element of `vals` multiplied by the second element of `vals`, `r` is the second element of `vals`**.

Explanation: The code multiplies `prod` by `r`. Initially, `prod` is set to 1 times the first element of `vals`. After executing `prod *= r`, `prod` becomes the product of 1 and the first element of `vals` multiplied by `r`, which is the second element of `vals`. The values of `t`, `N`, and `vals` remain unchanged.
