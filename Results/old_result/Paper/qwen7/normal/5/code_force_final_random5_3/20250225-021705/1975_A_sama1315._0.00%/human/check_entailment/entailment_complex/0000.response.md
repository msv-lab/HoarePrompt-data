### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them any number of times.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It returns 'Yes' if the array is sorted.
   - It returns 'No' if there is at least one element that is greater than its next element.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads input from standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), the size of each array (`n`), and the elements of each array.
   - It processes each array by calling `func_1` and collecting the results.

5. **Output Handling**:
   - The function prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the array is already sorted (returns 'Yes').
   - It also correctly identifies when the array cannot be sorted by any number of splits and swaps (returns 'No').

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The `func_1` function accurately determines if an array is sorted, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

### Correctness:
**True**
