Output State: **`left` is an integer greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `leftZero` is unchanged, `rightZero` is unchanged, `rightOne` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `left -= 1` decreases the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was initially an integer greater than 0, after decrementing, `left` is now an integer greater than 0 but decreased by 1. The conditions for setting `leftZero` and updating `rightZero` or `rightOne` are not met because the code only decrements `left` without checking the character at the new index or updating `leftZero`, `rightZero`, or `rightOne`. Therefore, these variables remain unchanged.
