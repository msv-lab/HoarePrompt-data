Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N`. The variables involved here are `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
   - `num` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `N` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Check if the loop can execute based on the initial state**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `N` must contain at least one element. If `N` is empty, the loop will not execute because there are no values for `num` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `N` is the only variable in the loop head that can affect the loop's execution, we need to ensure that `N` is not empty. 

Given the initial state where `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` is an empty set, the length of `cnt` is 0, `cur` is -1, and `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, we need to ensure that `N` is not empty for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `N` must not be an empty list.

**State: **`N` must not be an empty list**
