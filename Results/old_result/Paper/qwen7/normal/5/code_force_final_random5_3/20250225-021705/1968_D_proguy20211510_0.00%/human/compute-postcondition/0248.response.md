Output State: **`foundb` is `True`, `i` is `length_of_pres + 2`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 2`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing either three or four elements with the last element being `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is a list containing four elements with the last element being `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `b` has the additional element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Since `b` was previously either three or four elements long with the last element being `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, now it has one more element added to it, which is `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
