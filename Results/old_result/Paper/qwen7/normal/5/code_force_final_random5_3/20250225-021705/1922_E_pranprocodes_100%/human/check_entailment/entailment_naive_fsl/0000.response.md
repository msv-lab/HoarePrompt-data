Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate an array with the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by \(X\). Instead, it generates an array of length \(t\) (where \(t\) is the number of steps taken in the loop) with alternating maximum and minimum values. This approach does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly \(X\).

For example, consider the case where \(X = 3\):
- The program will generate an array like \([-1, 100000000, -1, 100000000, -1]\).
- This array has more than 3 increasing subsequences, such as \([-1, 100000000]\), \([-1, -1, 100000000]\), and others, which means it does not meet the requirement of having exactly 3 increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases.
