#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i <= 99.

    #State: Output State: The list `a` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution. The list `c` contains elements from `a` based on the conditions specified within the loop. The variable `n` is the length of `c` after all iterations. If any element `a[i]` in `a` is greater than 10 and `i > 0`, `c` will include the last digit of `a[i]` and the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, with `n` incremented by 1 or 2 based on whether the integer part is less than or equal to the last digit. If `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10`, `c` will include the last digit and the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10, with `n` incremented by 1 or 2 based on the same condition. For all other elements in `a`, `c` simply appends them, incrementing `n` by 1.
    #
    #In summary, `c` will contain a sequence of elements derived from `a` according to the specified rules, and `n` will be the total count of these elements in `c`.
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: `c` remains unchanged, `d` is the sorted version of `c`, `n` is the length of `c`, and if `c` is already sorted, `b` contains the element 1. Otherwise, `b` is a list with an additional element 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) followed by \( n \) integers (\( 2 \leq n \leq 50 \)) within the range [0, 99]. For each test case, it constructs a list \( c \) based on specific conditions involving the digits of the integers. It then sorts \( c \) and checks if the original list \( c \) was already sorted. If \( c \) was sorted, it appends 1 to a list \( b \); otherwise, it appends 0. The function ultimately returns the list \( b \).
