Reasoning:
- The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem's logic. Specifically, the program does not read the actual input values for the array `a`, nor does it perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array elements as required by the problem statement.
- The function `func_1` is hardcoded to handle only the case when `c` (which is supposed to be the length of the array `a`) is exactly 2. For other lengths, it simply prints a fixed output without performing any operations.
- Given the problem constraints and examples, the program should dynamically handle different lengths of arrays and perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.
- The provided code does not reflect the dynamic nature required to solve the problem for all possible lengths of the array from 1 to 18, and it does not include the logic to compute the MEX or update the array elements as specified.

Correctness: **False**
