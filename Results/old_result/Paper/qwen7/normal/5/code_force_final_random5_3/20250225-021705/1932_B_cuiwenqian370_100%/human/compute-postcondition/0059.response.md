Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), `results` is a list containing one element which is the string representation of `last_year`.**

Explanation:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is equal to `n`.
- The condition `n` must be greater than 2 ensures that the loop ran at least three times.
- After the loop, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, which is the value calculated in the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `next_year` is computed as ((`last_year` + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), indicating that `last_year` has been updated to this value after the final iteration.
- The line `results.append(str(last_year))` appends the string representation of `last_year` to the list `results`, making `results` a list containing one element.
