Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. It does not affect the values of `t` and `i`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `i` remains 0. The values of `n` and `k` are the integers entered by the user.
