Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`.
- `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`.

We need to determine the value of `round(a * d)`.

Given that `d = c / 2`, we can substitute this into the expression `a * d`:

\[ a * d = a * \left(\frac{c}{2}\right) = \frac{a * c}{2} \]

Since `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`, we have:

\[ a * b \geq \frac{a * c}{2} \]

This inequality holds true because `b` is an integer and it is derived from the input split along with `a` and `c`.

When we round `a * d`, we get:

\[ \text{round}\left(\frac{a * c}{2}\right) \]

Since `a` and `c` are integers, `a * c` is also an integer, and dividing it by 2 results in either an integer or a half-integer. Rounding this value will give us the nearest integer.

However, without specific values for `a` and `c`, we cannot determine the exact numerical result. But we know the expression evaluates to an integer after rounding.

Output: **round((a * c) / 2)**
