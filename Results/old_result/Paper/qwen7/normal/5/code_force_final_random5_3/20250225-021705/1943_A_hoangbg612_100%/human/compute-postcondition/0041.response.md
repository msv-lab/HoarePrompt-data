Postcondition: **Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will have the following characteristics: `cur` is the highest value in the list `N` that satisfies the condition `num > cur - 1`. The dictionary `M` will have entries where the key is the value of `cur` at the point when it was last updated (either directly by setting `cur = num` or incremented by 1). For each key, the value will be the count of numbers in `N` that are either equal to the key or fall within the range `[cur - 1, cur]`. Additionally, the sum of all values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`.**
