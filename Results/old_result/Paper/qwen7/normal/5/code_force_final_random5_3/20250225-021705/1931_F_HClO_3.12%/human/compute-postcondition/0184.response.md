Output State: **`idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `idx1` is updated to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
