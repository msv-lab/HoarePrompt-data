Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer.
- `k` is the integer obtained from the same line after splitting and converting to integer.
- The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('-1')
```

This code snippet directly prints the string `-1` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **-1**
