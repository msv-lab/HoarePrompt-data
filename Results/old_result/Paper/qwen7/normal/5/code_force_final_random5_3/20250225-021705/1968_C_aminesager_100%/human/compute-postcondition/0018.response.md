Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is false**

Explanation: The variable `t` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `true` to `false`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
