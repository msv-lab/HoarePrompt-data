Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 2`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits it into a list of integers using a list comprehension. The `num_tests` and `n` variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The new variable `nums` is created and contains the list of integers from the input.
