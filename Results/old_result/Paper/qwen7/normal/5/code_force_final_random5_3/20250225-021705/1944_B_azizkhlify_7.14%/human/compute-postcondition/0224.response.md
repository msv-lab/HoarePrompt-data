Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(n, 2 * n)` will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[n, 2 * n)`. This means that the loop will start with `i = n` and continue until `i < 2 * n`.

3. **Understand the Output Requirement**: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a string formed by concatenating the values of `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]` from the array `a`. This implies that the loop must access these indices of the array.

4. **Ensure the Array Indices Are Valid**: Since the loop starts at `i = n` and goes up to `2 * n - 1`, we need to ensure that the indices `0`, `3`, and `5` are valid during the loop execution. For this, `n` must be such that `n <= 5` (since `i` can go up to `2 * n - 1` and still include `a[5]`).

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can access `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]` and that `i` starts from `n` and goes up to `2 * n - 1`.

Given these points, we can conclude that the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is such that the loop can access the required indices of the array `a` and that `i` starts from `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is an array that includes at least the elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`, `n` must be less than or equal to 5, and `i` is now `n`**
