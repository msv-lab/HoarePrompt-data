Output State: **`foundb` is True, `i` is either 4 or 2; `k` is greater than `i + 1`; `b` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `b` has an additional element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `a` or `pb`, we cannot determine the exact value of the new element in `b`. However, we know that `b` now contains one more element, which is `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
