Output State: **`p2` is 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, `i` is 1.**

The code simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `p2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
