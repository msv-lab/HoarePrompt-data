Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a[i]` is equal to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`, and all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` are computed as per the loop, starting from `a[0] = 500` and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the user-input list `x`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will have been updated such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the initial value 500 and the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`. The variable `i` will have the final value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
