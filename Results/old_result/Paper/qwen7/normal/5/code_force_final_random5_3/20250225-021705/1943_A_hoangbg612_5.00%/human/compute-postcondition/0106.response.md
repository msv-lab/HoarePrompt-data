Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `cur`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the given information, after executing the if statement, `cur` holds the highest number found in `N`, and `M[cur]` is 1 while all other entries in `M` are 0.
   - The variable `i` retains its last incremented value, which is `len(N) - 1`.
   - `S` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the loop operations.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `i` is less than `cur`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` must be initialized to a value that allows the loop to potentially execute. Given that `i` retains its last incremented value (`len(N) - 1`), we need to ensure that this value is less than `cur` for the loop to start.
   - `cur` must be set to the highest number found in `N`.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State:**
- `i` is `len(N) - 1` and must be less than `cur`.
- `cur` is the highest number found in `N`.
- `S` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the loop operations.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `len(N) - 1` and must be less than `cur`, `cur` is the highest number found in `N`, `S` remains unchanged**.
