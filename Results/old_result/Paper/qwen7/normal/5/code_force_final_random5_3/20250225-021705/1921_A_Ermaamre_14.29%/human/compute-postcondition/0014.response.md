Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input, `y4` is the second integer from the input, `x1` is equal to `x3`, `x2` is equal to `x4`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` if `y1` is less than `y3`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.
