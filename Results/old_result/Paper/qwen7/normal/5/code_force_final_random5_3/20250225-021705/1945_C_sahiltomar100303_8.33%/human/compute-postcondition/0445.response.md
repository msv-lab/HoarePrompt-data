Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is explicitly given as 0.
- `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `right`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, and `trightZero` are described in terms of `n` and other conditions, but their exact values are not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(left)
```

Since `left` is explicitly given as 0, the output will be:

Output: **0**
