Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All iterations of the loop have been executed. `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, or it remains 0 if no 'B' is found. The value of `i` is equal to the length of `inpstr` if the loop completes without finding a 'B'. The other variables (`j`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `ind2`, `inpstr`, `outind`) remain in their initial or unchanged states.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(inpstr)):
    if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
        ind2 = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `ind2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B'. If `inpstr[-i - 1]` is not 'B', the postcondition remains as the initial state where `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `ind2` is 1. If the character at index `-i - 1` (which is `-2`) in `inpstr` is 'B', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to `i` and `ind2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `ind2` is 1. If `inpstr[-i - 1]` equals 'B', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `inpstr[-i - 1]` does not equal 'B', the values of `i` and `ind2` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
