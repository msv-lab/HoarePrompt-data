Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each unique value in `nums`. `res` is the cumulative result of adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for every `cnt` (frequency) that is 3 or more, and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for every `cnt` (frequency) that is 2 or more, where `total_sum` is the sum of all frequencies in `num_of_lens.values()` except for the current `cnt`. `t` remains 0 or negative, `n` is the input integer, `nums` is an empty list, and the loop processes all values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to their conditions.

In simpler terms, `res` will be the sum of combinations calculated based on the frequencies of numbers in `nums`, specifically:
- For every frequency of 3 or more, add the combination of choosing 3 out of that frequency.
- For every frequency of 2 or more, add twice the product of the combination of choosing 2 out of that frequency and the sum of all other frequencies.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
