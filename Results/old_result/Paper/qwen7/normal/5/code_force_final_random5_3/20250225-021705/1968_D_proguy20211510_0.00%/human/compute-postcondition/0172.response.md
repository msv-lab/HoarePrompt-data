Output State: **`i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `p`. The values of `i`, `rem`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged from their initial state.
