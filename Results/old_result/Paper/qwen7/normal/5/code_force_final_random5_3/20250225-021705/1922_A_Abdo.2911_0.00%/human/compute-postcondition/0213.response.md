Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is False, and `i` is either `i + 1` or 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `match_a_b`, `match_c`, or `i`. It only indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states, and the fact that a break statement has been executed is noted.
