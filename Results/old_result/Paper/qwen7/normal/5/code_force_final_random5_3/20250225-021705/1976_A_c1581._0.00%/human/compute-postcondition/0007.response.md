Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly n characters, where 1 <= n <= 20, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is a list containing all the characters from the `password` string that are not digits; `letters` has one additional character appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `letters.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the list `letters`. Since `char` is a character from the `password` string that is not a digit (as per the precondition), `letters` now contains all the non-digit characters from the `password` string plus the newly appended character. The values of `password` and `digits` remain unchanged.
