Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(mid)`. Therefore, the variables that need to be considered are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(mid)` generates values from 0 to `mid-1`.

3. **Determine the Value of `mid`**: From the given information, `mid` is defined as `n // 2`. For the loop to execute, `mid` must be at least 1 (since `range(0)` would generate no values).

4. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above points, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and `mid` is at least 1.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `mid`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`tleftZero` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `rightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is 0**
