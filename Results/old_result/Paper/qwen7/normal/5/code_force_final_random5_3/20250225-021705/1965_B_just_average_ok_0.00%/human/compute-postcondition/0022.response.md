Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` is the second integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.**

Explanation: The code sets `idx` to 0, which changes its value from 23 to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment statement. The element \(2^{23}\) is removed from `nums`, and the structure of `nums` remains otherwise intact.
