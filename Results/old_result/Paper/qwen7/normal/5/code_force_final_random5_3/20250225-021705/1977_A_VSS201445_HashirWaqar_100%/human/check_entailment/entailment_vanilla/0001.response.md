Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
   - It also checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even.

3. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Reasoning:

- **Initial Conditions**:
  - The problem states that in each move, Nikita either adds or removes exactly one cube.
  - Therefore, the total number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can only change by an even number if the number of additions equals the number of removals.

- **Key Insight**:
  - To have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net effect of additions and removals must result in `m` cubes.
  - This means that the difference between the number of additions and removals must be `m`.
  - Since each move changes the count by 1, the total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` (because you need at least `m` moves to add `m` cubes).
  - Additionally, the difference `(n - m)` must be even because each move (addition or removal) changes the count by 1, and the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference must match the parity of the number of moves.

### Verification:

- **Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `n >= m` is true.
  - `(n - m) = 0`, which is even.
  - Output: "YES" (Correct).

- **Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `n >= m` is false.
  - Output: "NO" (Correct).

- **Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `n >= m` is true.
  - `(n - m) = 2`, which is even.
  - Output: "YES" (Correct).

Given that the conditions in the program correctly reflect the logic required to determine if `m` cubes can be achieved after `n` moves, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
