### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the program is incorrect:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array. The provided solution sorts the array and computes the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. While sorting ensures that the differences are minimized, it does not necessarily maximize the beauty.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. One effective strategy is to place the smallest element at one end and the largest element at the other end, and then arrange the remaining elements in increasing order between them. This ensures that the largest possible differences are between the smallest and largest elements and the next smallest and next largest elements, respectively.

3. **Counterexample Analysis**:
   - Consider the input array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`.
   - The program sorts this array to `[54, 80, 90, 100, 43]` and computes the beauty as:
     \[
     |80 - 54| + |90 - 80| + |100 - 90| + |43 - 100| = 26 + 10 + 10 + 57 = 93
     \]
   - However, the optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty would be `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, which gives:
     \[
     |54 - 43| + |80 - 54| + |90 - 80| + |100 - 90| = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57
     \]
   - Clearly, the program's approach does not yield the maximum beauty.

4. **Conclusion**: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Sorting the array does not guarantee the maximum beauty, as demonstrated by the counterexample. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not always produce the maximum beauty of the array.
