Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4; the value of t is now an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is read and assigned to `t`, the initial range constraint for `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4) is still valid, but now `t` holds the specific value entered by the user. All other preconditions remain unchanged.
