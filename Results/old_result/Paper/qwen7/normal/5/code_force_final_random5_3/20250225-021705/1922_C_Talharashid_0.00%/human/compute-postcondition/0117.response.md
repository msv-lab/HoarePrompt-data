Output State: **`start` is an input integer, `end` is an input integer, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is the final accumulated value of `s` after all iterations, `i` is 0, `m` is the input integer `m`.**

Explanation: The code `start, end = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them by space, assigning the first integer to `start` and the second integer to `end`. The values of `inc`, `mini`, `s`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
