Output: **Yes**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. The print statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`. Therefore, the output will be `Yes`.
