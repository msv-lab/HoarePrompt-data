Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is -1, `T` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `M` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `N` must have at least one element. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is set to `num`, `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is either the same as the previous `cur` or the new `num` if the condition is met, and `M[cur]` is updated to 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise `M[cur]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` must have at least one element (one less than before), `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is either the same as the previous `cur` or the new `num` if the condition is met, `M[cur]` is updated to 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise `M[cur]` is increased by 1, and `M[cur]` is now 1 if the condition `num > cur` is true, otherwise `M[cur]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
