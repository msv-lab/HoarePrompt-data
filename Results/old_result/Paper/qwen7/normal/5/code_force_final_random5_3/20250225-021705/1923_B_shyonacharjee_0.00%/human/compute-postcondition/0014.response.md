Output State: **`success` is False, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is its original value, `health` is its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`.**

Explanation: The variable `success` is assigned the boolean value `False`. None of the other variables (`bullets_needed`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
