Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` with a step of 2. This means `i` starts at 1 if `x` is even, and at 2 if `x` is odd, and increments by 2 each time.

3. **Understand the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, we know that if `x % i == 0`, then `l` is updated according to certain rules. If the condition is not met, `l` remains unchanged.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: We know that `l` is a list, and its contents depend on whether `x % i == 0` was true for the previous value of `i`.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - The value of `i` will increase by 2 for the next iteration.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged.
   - The list `l` may change based on the condition `x % i == 0`.

6. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, if the previous value of `i` was `i_prev`, the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.

7. **Update the state**: The state needs to reflect the new value of `i` and the potential update to `l`.

Given the previous state where `l` is a list and the condition `x % i == 0` determines its contents, we need to consider the next possible value of `i` and the potential update to `l`.

**State:**
- `i` will be incremented by 2 from its previous value.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `l` may be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Since the exact contents of `l` depend on the condition `x % i == 0`, we cannot specify the exact contents of `l` without knowing the result of the condition for the new value of `i`. However, we can state that `l` will either remain unchanged or be updated based on the new value of `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`l` is a list, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 2, `x` is unchanged, and `l` may be updated based on the new value of `i`**.
