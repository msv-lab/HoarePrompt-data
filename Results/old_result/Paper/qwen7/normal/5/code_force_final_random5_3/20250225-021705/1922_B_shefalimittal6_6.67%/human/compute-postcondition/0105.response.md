Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the value of `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `res` was previously equal to `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, now it becomes `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
