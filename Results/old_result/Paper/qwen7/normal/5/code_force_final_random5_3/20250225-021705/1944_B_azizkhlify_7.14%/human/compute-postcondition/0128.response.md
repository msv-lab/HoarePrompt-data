Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part of the for loop. This means that the loop will iterate based on the input value provided.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `i` is `2 * n - 1`.
   - If `ul` does not equal `ur`, then `i` is `2 * n - 1` and `ul` equals `ur`.

3. **Understand what changes occur in each iteration**:
   - The loop iterates based on user input, which means the number of iterations is determined by the input value.
   - There are no explicit changes mentioned for `res`, `i`, `ul`, or `ur` within the loop body (as it is omitted).

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The only change that occurs is the decrement of the loop counter. Since the loop is iterating based on user input, the input value decreases by 1 each time the loop runs.
   - Therefore, if the loop was run once before, the input value has decreased by 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The input value has decreased by 1, so the new input value is `int(input()) - 1`.
   - `res` remains an empty list.
   - `i` remains `2 * n - 1` because there are no changes to `i` within the loop.
   - The condition for `ul` and `ur` remains the same as long as the loop continues.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, and `ul` equals `ur` if `ul` does not equal `ur`, otherwise `ul` and `ur` can be any values as they are not specified to change. The input value for the next iteration is `int(input()) - 1`.**
