Output State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the value returned by `input()` to the list `a`. Since `input()` waits for user input, the value of `a` becomes a list with one element, which is the string input provided by the user. The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
