Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):`. The variables involved here are `i`, `sequence`, and the default value used in the `max` function.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable that will be initialized and incremented/decremented within the loop.
   - `sequence` is the input to the `max` function, which determines the starting point of the range.
   - The `default` parameter of the `max` function is set to `0`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will start from `max(sequence, default=0)` and decrement `i` until it reaches `-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is initialized appropriately based on the value of `sequence`.
   - Since the loop decrements `i` from `max(sequence, default=0)` to `-1`, `i` should start from a non-negative value (since `default` is `0`).

Given the initial state where `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`, we need to focus on adjusting the state of `sequence` and `i`.

- If `sequence` is a positive number, `max(sequence, default=0)` will be `sequence`, and the loop will start from `sequence` and decrement to `-1`.
- If `sequence` is `0`, `max(sequence, default=0)` will still be `0`, and the loop will start from `0` and decrement to `-1`.

In both cases, the loop will execute as long as `sequence` is non-negative.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `sequence` is non-negative, and `i` is initialized to the appropriate starting value.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 0), sequence must be non-negative, and i is initialized to max(sequence, default=0)**
