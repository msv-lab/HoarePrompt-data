Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23 with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^23` and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element `1 << idx` (which is `2^23`) has been removed from `nums`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Since `idx` is 23, `1 << idx` is `2^23`. After removing `2^23` from `nums`, the list `nums` no longer contains this element. All other variables remain unchanged.
