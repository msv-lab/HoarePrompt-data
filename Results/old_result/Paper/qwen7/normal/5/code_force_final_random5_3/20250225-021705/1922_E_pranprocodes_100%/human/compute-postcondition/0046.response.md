Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing alternating values starting from 100000000 and decreasing by 1 each time until -99999998, and `ans` has been reversed, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `min` from -99999998 to -100000000. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
