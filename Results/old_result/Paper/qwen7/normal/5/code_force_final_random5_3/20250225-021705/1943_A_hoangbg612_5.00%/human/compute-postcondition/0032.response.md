Postcondition: `N` must have at least one element (one less than before), `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is either the same as the previous `cur` or increased by 1 depending on the condition, and `M[cur]` is updated to 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise `M[cur]` is increased by 1. If the condition `num > cur + 1` is true, `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
