Postcondition: `left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is either (`leftZero` - 1) if `s[left - 1]` is '0', or remains the same, `rightOne` is either increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', or increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0', `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', and `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0'.
