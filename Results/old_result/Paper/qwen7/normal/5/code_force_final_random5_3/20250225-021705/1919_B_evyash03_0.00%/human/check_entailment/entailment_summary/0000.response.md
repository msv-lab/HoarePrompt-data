Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` represented by the string `s`.
2. The penalty calculation involves splitting the array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray.
3. The provided code does not correctly implement the penalty calculation logic. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of splits needed to ensure the balance (difference between the number of '+' and '-') is non-negative.
4. The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement. It simply counts the number of splits required to make the balance non-negative, which does not necessarily minimize the total penalty.
5. The example test cases provided do not align with the expected output based on the given function's logic, indicating that the function is not solving the problem as intended.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
