Postcondition: **`N` must have at least one element (one less than before), `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is either the same as the previous `cur` or the new `num` if the condition is met, `M[cur]` is updated to 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise `M[cur]` is increased by 1, and `M[cur]` is now 1 if the condition `num > cur` is true, otherwise `M[cur]` is increased by 1.**
