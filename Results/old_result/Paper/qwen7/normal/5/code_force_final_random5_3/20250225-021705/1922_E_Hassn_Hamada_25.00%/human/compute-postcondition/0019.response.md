Output State: `size` is 5, `number` must be greater than or equal to 31, `sequence` is a list with five elements, each being 4.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `size` becomes 5 because the loop increments `size` by 1 each time it runs, stopping when `(1 << size + 1) - 1` exceeds `number`. Since `number` must be at least 31, the loop continues until `size` reaches 5. During each iteration, the loop appends the current value of `i`, which remains 4, to the `sequence` list. Therefore, after 5 iterations, `sequence` contains five elements, each equal to 4.
