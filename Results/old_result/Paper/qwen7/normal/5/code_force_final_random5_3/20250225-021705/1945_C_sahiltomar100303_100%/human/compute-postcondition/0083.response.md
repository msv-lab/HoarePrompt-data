Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus 2, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, and `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2**.

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was initially the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus 1, after incrementing it becomes the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
