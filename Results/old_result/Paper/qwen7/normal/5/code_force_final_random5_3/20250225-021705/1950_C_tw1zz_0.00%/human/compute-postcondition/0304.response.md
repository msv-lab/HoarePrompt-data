Output State: **`h1` is '03', `m1` is equal to the string `m` from the user's input split by ':', `time` is 'AM'**.

The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. Since the initial state of `time` was an empty string, it is now updated to `'AM'`. The values of `h1` and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
