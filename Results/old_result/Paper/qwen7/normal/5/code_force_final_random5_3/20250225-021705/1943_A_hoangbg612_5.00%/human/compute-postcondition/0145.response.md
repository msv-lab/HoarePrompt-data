Postcondition: `cur` is `-1`, `i` is `0`, `S` is an input integer, `T` is `1`, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`, and `num` is the last element of `N`. This is because either `num` is not greater than `cur + 1` (which is `-1 + 1 = 0`), and no change is made to `cur` and `i`, or `num` is less than or equal to `-1`, leading to `cur` being set to `-1` and `i` remaining `0`.
