Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is either `-1` or `i+1`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

The code `p1 = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `p1`. The other variables (`m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p2`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
