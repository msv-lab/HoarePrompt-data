You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        print(dx * dx)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four points defining a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It calculates the side length of each square (the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates) and prints the square of this side length for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the maximum difference in the x-coordinates will give one side length, and the maximum difference in the y-coordinates will give the other side length. However, since the square's sides are equal, the area is simply the square of the maximum difference in either the x or y coordinates.

The program iterates through the four given points to extract their x and y coordinates, finds the maximum and minimum values for both x and y, and then calculates the area as the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This approach ensures that the program works correctly for any set of four points that form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Given the constraints and the guarantees in the problem description, this program should handle all valid inputs correctly.
