Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. Here's a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Check**: For each test case, it calculates the total amount of water and checks if this total is divisible by `n` (the number of containers). If not, it immediately returns 'NO' because it's impossible to make the amounts equal.
3. **Mean Calculation**: If the total is divisible by `n`, it calculates the mean amount of water per container.
4. **Balance Check**: It then iterates through the containers, keeping track of the balance between the current total and the target mean. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it means it's not possible to achieve equal distribution, and it returns 'NO'.
5. **Final Output**: If no imbalance is found during the iteration, it returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make the amounts equal.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines the possibility of equalizing the water amounts across all containers.
