Output State: **`ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers formed from `arr[i - 1]` followed by the current element of `arr` as a single integer, and `arr[i - 1]` is now the first element of `nums`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` remains unchanged and is still `False`.
- `i` remains unchanged and is still `m - 2`.
- `nums` is updated to be a list of integers. It is constructed by converting each character of the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` into an integer and appending the integer form of the current element of `arr` (which is `arr[i]`).
- `arr[i - 1]` is now the first element of the list `nums`.
