Output State: **All possible outputs based on the given conditions have been printed.**

Natural Language Description: After all iterations of the loop have executed, the output will consist of all possible results generated by the loop based on the given conditions. Specifically, for each line of input, the loop processes the values of `n` and `k` as follows:
- If `k` is greater than or equal to 2:
  - If `n` equals `k`, it prints a list containing `k` occurrences of `k`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
- If `k` is less than 2, it prints a list containing the integers from 1 to `n`.

Since the loop continues until all lines of input have been processed, the final output state will include all these printed results. The value of `t` (the initial integer) remains unchanged and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
