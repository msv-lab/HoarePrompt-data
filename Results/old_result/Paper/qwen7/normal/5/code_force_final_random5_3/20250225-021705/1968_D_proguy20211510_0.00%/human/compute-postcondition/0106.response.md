Postcondition: `i` is either 4 or 2; `k` is greater than `i + 1`; `b` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`; `s` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`; `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.

This means that regardless of whether the condition `a[pb - 1] == maxa` is true or false, the final state of the variables will be as follows: `i` remains either 4 or 2, `k` remains greater than `i + 1`, `b` will contain at least the element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and possibly the additional element `a[pb - 1]`, `s` will contain the element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `pb` will be updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
