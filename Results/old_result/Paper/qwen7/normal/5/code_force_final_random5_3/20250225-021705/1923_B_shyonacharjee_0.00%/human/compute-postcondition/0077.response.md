Postcondition: **`distance` is equal to `abs(position)`, `success` remains False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `i` is n-1, `bullets_needed` is the `health` of the current monster, if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available`, the loop or if statement is exited and `success` is set to False.**
