### Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - The task is to decode an encoded string \( b \) back to the original string \( s \).
   - The encoding process involves creating a sorted string \( r \) of unique characters from \( s \) and then replacing each character in \( s \) with its corresponding character from the reverse of \( r \).

2. **Analyze the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string \( b \) and the string itself.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string \( b \).
   - In `func_1`, a dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in \( b \) to its corresponding character in the reverse of \( r \). This mapping is done by sorting the unique characters of \( b \), and then for each character in the sorted list, it maps it to the character at the corresponding position from the end of the sorted list.
   - Finally, the function iterates through each character in \( b \), looks up the corresponding character in `char_map`, and constructs the decoded string \( s \).

3. **Check the Logic**:
   - The creation of `char_map` ensures that each character in \( b \) is correctly mapped to its counterpart in the reverse of \( r \).
   - The iteration through \( b \) and constructing \( s \) using `char_map` is logically sound and should produce the correct decoded string.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation of `char_map`. The problem states that the encoding process uses the reverse of the sorted unique characters of \( s \) to map characters. But the code in `func_1` creates `char_map` based on the reverse of the sorted unique characters of \( b \), not \( s \). This means that the `char_map` might not accurately reflect the reverse mapping required for the decoding process.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:
- Suppose \( s = "codeforces" \). The encoded string \( b \) would be "serofedsoc".
- The unique characters of \( s \) are "cdefors", and the reverse of this sorted string is "srofedc".
- The correct `char_map` for decoding should map each character in \( b \) to the corresponding character in "srofedc".
- However, the code currently maps each character in \( b \) to the corresponding character in "srofedc" but in a different way, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the code should create `char_map` based on the reverse of the sorted unique characters of \( s \), not \( b \).

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create the auxiliary string r from the unique characters of b
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    # Create the char_map based on the reverse of r
    char_map = {c: r[-(i+1)] for i, c in enumerate(r)}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

With this corrected implementation, the `char_map` will correctly map each character in \( b \) to its corresponding character in the reverse of the sorted unique characters of \( s \), ensuring the correct decoding.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the code incorrectly creates the `char_map` based on the reverse of the sorted unique characters of \( b \) instead of \( s \). The corrected code should use the reverse of the sorted unique characters of \( s \) to ensure the correct decoding.
