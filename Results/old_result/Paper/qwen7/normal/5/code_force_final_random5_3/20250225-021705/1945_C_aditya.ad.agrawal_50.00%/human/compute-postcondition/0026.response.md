Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, `o_r` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `o_r -= 1` decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. Initially, `o_r` was set to 2. After executing the code, `o_r` becomes 1. All other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `pos`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
