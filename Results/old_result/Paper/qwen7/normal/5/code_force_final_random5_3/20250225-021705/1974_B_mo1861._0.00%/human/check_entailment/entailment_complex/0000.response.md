Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the decoding logic as per the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` first creates a mapping (`char_map`) that associates each unique character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the reverse order of the sorted unique characters.
3. This mapping is constructed such that the first character in the sorted unique set of `b` maps to the last character in the alphabetically sorted unique set of `b`, and so on.
4. The function then iterates through each character in `b`, uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding decoded character, and appends it to the result string `s`.
5. Given that the problem guarantees that `b` is the result of encoding some string `s`, the mapping and decoding process should work correctly for any valid input `b`.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
