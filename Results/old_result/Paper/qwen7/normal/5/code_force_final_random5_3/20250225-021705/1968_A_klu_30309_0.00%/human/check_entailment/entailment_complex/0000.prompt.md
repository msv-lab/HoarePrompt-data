Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `max_val` is set to the largest value of `y` (where `2 * y` is less than or equal to `x`) found during the loop's execution. If no such `y` exists, `max_val` remains 1.
    return max_val
    #The program returns max_val which is set to the largest value of y where 2 * y is less than or equal to x, if no such y exists, max_val remains 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer \( x \) such that \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \). It returns the largest integer \( y \) that satisfies one of the following conditions:
1. \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) and \( x > 1 \) and \( x \leq 2y \).
2. \( x \) is divisible by \( y-1 \) and \( 2(y-1) < x \).
3. \( y = x - 2 \) when \( x > 2 \).
If no such \( y \) exists, it returns 1.
