Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is greater than 1, `leftZero` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially 2 (based on the conditions given), after executing this line, `leftZero` becomes 3. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
