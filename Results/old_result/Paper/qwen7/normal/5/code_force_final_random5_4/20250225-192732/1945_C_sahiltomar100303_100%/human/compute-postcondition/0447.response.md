Postcondition: `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1` + 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-2`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-2`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-2`, `left` is now `0`, `mid` is `0`, `right` is incremented to a value less than `n`, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 or remains less than 1, `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1` if `s[1]` is '0' or `trightOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[1]` is '1', and `trightOne` is less than `n // 2` if `s[1]` is '1'.
