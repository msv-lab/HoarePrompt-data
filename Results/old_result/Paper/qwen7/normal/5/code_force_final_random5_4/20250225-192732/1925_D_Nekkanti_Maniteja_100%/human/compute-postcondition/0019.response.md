Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 3, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. The values of `i`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `m`, `u`, `v`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `s` is now the sum of its original value and the new expression.
