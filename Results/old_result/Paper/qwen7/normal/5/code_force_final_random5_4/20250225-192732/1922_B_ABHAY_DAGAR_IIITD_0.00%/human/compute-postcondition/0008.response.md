Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the first element in `num_list`) has its value incremented by 1, `x` is the first element in `num_list`.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `x` in the `num_of_lens` dictionary by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
