Postcondition: `b` and `s` are lists. If `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, then `b` contains the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to it, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `a[pb - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, then `b` contains the value `a[pb - 1]` appended to it, and `s` remains unchanged. Additionally, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`.
