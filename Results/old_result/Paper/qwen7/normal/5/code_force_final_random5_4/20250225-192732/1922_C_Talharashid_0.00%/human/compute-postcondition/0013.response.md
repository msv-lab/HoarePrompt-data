Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` must be 0, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`, `start` plus 1 is less than the length of `lst`**.

This means that the variable `mini` is updated to be the smaller value between the current `mini` (which was initially 11111111) and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
