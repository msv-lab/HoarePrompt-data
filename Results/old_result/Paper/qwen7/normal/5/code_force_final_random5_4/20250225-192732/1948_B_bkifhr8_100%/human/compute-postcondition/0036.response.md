Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is `False`, `i` is `0`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be decremented until it reaches 0. Since the loop breaks when `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and updates `arr[i - 1]` to `arr[i]`, and given that `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks in this condition, `ans` remains `False` throughout the loop's execution. Therefore, once `i` reaches 0, the loop terminates, and the final state of the variables is as described.
