Output State: **`start` is increased by `inc` and must not be equal to 0; `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mini` to be the minimum value between the absolute difference of `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`, and the current value of `mini`. The precondition that `start` is increased by `inc` and must not be equal to 0 remains unchanged. The value of `mini` is updated based on the new comparison.
