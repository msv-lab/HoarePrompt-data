Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are integers. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is -1 and `idx2` is `i`, while `p1` is 0 and `p2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `idx1` and `idx2` are either both 0, or one of them is `i` with the corresponding `p1` or `p2` incremented by 1, and the other remains 0. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` remains `i + 1` and `idx2` becomes `i`, and the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` becomes `i` and `idx2` becomes `i`. Otherwise, `idx1` remains `i + 1` and `idx2` becomes `i`, and the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
