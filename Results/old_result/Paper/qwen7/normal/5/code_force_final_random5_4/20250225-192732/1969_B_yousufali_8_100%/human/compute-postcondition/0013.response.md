Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is 2, `ans` is 4, and `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += n + 1` increments the value of `ans` by `n + 1`. Given that `n` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + 2 + 1`, which results in `ans` being 4. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
