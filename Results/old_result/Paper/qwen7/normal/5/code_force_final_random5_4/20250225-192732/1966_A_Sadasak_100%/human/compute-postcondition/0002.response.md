Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is the original count of `num` in `frequency_table` plus one.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `num` in the `frequency_table`. Since `num` is the first element of `arr`, the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is updated by adding 1 to its current value (if it exists, otherwise starting from 0). All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
