Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is `x - y`, `res` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The other variables (`i`, `coord`, `p2`, `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
