Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`. This means we only need to adjust the state of `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < int(input())`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Adjust the State of `i`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.

4. **Check the Input**: The value of `int(input())` is not given explicitly, but it must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue. Since `i` is now 2, the loop will continue if `int(input())` is greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Other States**: The other states (`t`, `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

Based on this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of 99999997 and -100000000 and is reversed**.
