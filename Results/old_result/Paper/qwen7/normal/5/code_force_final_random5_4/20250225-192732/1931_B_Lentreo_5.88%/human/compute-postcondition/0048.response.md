Based on the initial state provided:

- `curr` is described as being the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the sum of all elements in `nums` except the last one. Given that `curr` is explicitly stated to be 0 after all iterations of the loop, we can directly use this value.
- No other variables or objects are mentioned that would affect the output of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
