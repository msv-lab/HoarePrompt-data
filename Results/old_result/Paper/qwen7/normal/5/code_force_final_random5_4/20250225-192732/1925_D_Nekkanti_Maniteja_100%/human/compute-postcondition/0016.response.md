Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 3, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over all iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is increased by `f` with each iteration.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations minus one. The variable `a` will hold the cumulative sum of all `f` values provided as input during each iteration of the loop. All other variables (`t`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `u`, `v`) retain their initial or state-dependent values as described in the problem statement.
