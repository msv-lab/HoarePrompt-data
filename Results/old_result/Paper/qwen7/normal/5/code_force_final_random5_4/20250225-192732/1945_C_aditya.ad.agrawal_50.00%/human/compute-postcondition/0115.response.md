Output State: **`pos` is increased by 2, `ans` is equal to `pos`, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `o_l` is set to 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`. This does not change the value of `pos`, but it introduces a new variable `ans` with the same value as `pos`. The conditions for changing `z_r` or setting `o_l` and decreasing `o_r` remain unchanged from the initial state.
