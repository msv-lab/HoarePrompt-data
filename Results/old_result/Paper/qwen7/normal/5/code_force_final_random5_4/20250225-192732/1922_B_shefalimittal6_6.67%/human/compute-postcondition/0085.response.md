Output State: All key-value pairs in `num_of_lens` have been processed, `res` contains the sum of all combinations calculated throughout the iterations of the loop, and `x` has been updated to the last remaining key in `num_of_lens` after all iterations. Specifically, `res` is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt` that is less than 3, and by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt` that is 2 or more, where `total_sum` is the sum of all other values in `num_of_lens` except for the current `cnt`.
