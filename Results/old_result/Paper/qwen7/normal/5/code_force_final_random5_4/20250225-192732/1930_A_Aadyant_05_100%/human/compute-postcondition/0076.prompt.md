Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for num in range(int(n)):
    s = 0
    list2 = []
    a = input()
    list1 = []
    b = input()
    list1 = b.split()
    for str in list1:
        list2.append(int(str))
    list2.sort()
    for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
        s = s + int(list2[i])
    final.append(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is the sum of `list2` at even indices, `t` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `num` retains its value, `a` retains its value, `b` retains its value, `list1` retains its value, and `final` contains the sum `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `list2` is a sorted version of the original `list1`, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`, `s` is the sum of the elements of `list2` at even indices, `final` contains the sum of elements at even indices of `list2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `list1` is empty, `str` is undefined, `list2` has at least 7 elements, `i` is 8, `s` is the sum of the integer values of the seventh, fifth, and third elements in `list2`, `final` is a list containing the value of `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
