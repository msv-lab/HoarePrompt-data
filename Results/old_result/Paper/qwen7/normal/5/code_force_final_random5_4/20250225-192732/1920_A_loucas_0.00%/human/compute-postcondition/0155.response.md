Output State: **`max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` must be `max(big) + 1`, and `num` is `max(big) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `num = i` assigns the value of `i` to `num`. Given the initial state, `i` is `max(big) + 1`, so `num` is also `max(big) + 1`. The conditions involving `max(big)` and `min(less)` remain unchanged.
