Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list with `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is equal to the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` plus `a[0] + T[0]`, and `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` converts the list `a` into a string where each element of `a` is converted to a string and joined with a space. This operation does not change the values of `i`, `n`, or `a`, but introduces a new variable `result` which contains the string representation of the list `a`. The precondition that `i` is `n-1` and `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. The list `a` retains its original structure and values.
