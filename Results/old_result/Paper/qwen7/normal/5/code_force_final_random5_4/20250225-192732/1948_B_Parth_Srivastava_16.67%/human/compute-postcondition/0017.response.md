Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is a list containing the value `x`, `i` is greater than 0, and the current value of `y` is less than or equal to the last element of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. Since `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, the updated list `c` now contains the value `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
