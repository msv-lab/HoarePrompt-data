Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('4', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('x', 'y'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is 0, `res` is 0, `n` is 1, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`**

Explanation: The code calculates the squared distance between the points represented by the first two tuples in the `coord` list. The first tuple is `('4', 'input integer')` and the second tuple is `('input integer', 'input integer')`. Therefore, `p1` is calculated as \((\text{input integer} - 4)^2 + (\text{input integer} - \text{input integer})^2\). Since the second coordinate of the second tuple is the same as the second coordinate of the third tuple, the second term in the expression is 0. Thus, `p1` simplifies to \((\text{input integer} - 4)^2\). All other variables remain unchanged.
