Output State: `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input provided by the user. The first element of the list `a` is the initial input provided by the user, and the last element is the most recent input provided by the user. `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in the list `a`, concatenated together. `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in the list `a`, concatenated together. `i` is `-1` since the loop has completed all its iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will contain all the inputs provided by the user in the order they were entered. `first_row` will be a string made up of the first character from each input string, and `last_row` will be a string made up of the last character from each input string. The variable `i` will be set to `-1` as it has gone through all its iterations.
