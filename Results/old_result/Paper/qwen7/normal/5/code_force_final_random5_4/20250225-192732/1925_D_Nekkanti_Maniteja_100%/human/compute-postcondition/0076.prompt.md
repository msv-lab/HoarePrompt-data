Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `i_prev + (3 * 6)`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + (3 * 6)`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split, repeated for each iteration, `a` is increased by `f` for each iteration, and `a` is now the sum of all `f` values provided by the input over all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `i_prev + 18`, `m` must still be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 18`, `u`, `v`, and `f` will contain the last set of inputs provided by the user, and `a` will be the total sum of all `f` values provided as input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `i_prev`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 18`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split, repeated for each iteration, `a` is increased by `f` for each iteration, and `a` is now the sum of all `f` values provided by the input over all iterations, `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 19`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the input over all iterations, `s` is updated to `s + c * (i_prev + 1) * c * m + c * a`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 19`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the input over all iterations, `s` is updated to `s + c * (i_prev + 1) * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
