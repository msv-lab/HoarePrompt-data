Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list, and the list at index `idx1` has been inserted with the value `a2`, `l` is now equal to `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The list at index `idx1` still contains the value `a2`.
