Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
3. The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b` back to the original string `s`.
4. Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `char_map` is created to map each unique character in `b` to its corresponding character in the reverse alphabetical order.
5. The mapping is done such that the last unique character in the sorted list of unique characters from `b` is mapped to 'a', the second last to 'b', and so on, with the first unique character being mapped to 'z'.
6. After constructing the `char_map`, the function iterates through each character in `b` and constructs the decoded string `s` by appending the corresponding character from `char_map`.
7. The final decoded string `s` is returned.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic in `func_1` accurately implements the decoding process as required. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
