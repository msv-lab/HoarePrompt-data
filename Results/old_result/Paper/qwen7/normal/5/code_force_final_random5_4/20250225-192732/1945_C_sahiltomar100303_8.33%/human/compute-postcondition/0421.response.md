Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 3 and must be less than `n`, if `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is decremented by 1 and `tleftOne` remains unchanged, if `s[right]` is not '0', then `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` was an index within the string `s` plus 2 and must be less than `n`. After incrementing, `right` becomes an index within the string `s` plus 3. The conditions for updating `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain the same as they depend on the value of `s[right]`, which hasn't changed yet.
