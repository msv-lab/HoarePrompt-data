Output State: **`cur` is the next element in the list `N` if it was not -1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value 2 if `num > cur`, otherwise `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Initially, the value of `M[cur]` is 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise it is 1 for the key `-1`. After executing the code, the value of `M[cur]` becomes 2 if `num > cur`, and remains 1 for the key `-1`. All other variables (`cur`, `T`, `S`, `N`) remain unchanged.
