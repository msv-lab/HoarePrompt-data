Output State: **`input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 representing the length of the array, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `results` is a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `array`, or `results`. It only changes how the `input` function is referenced within the program. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
