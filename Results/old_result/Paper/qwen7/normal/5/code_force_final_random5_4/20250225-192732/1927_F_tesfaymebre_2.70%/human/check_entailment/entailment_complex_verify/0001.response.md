### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, and then reading the edges along with their weights.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`) and a list of edges (`edges`). This is correct and necessary for efficient cycle detection.

3. **Sorting Edges**:
   - The edges are sorted in reverse order based on their weights. This is done to process the heaviest edges first, which helps in finding cycles more efficiently. This is a valid strategy.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to keep track of connected components and the minimum edge weight within each component. The DSU is correctly initialized with `n + 1` elements (to handle 1-based indexing).

5. **Finding Minimum Weight Cycle**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles. If a cycle is detected (`parent_u == parent_v`), the program updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle. If no cycle is detected, the DSU is updated with the new edge. This logic is correct and should work as intended.

6. **Cycle Detection Using DFS**:
   - After identifying the minimum weight edge in a cycle, the program uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the exact cycle involving the identified nodes. The DFS function marks visited nodes and returns the path of the cycle. This is a valid approach to find the cycle.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle. It also prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order. This matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Detailed Verification

- **Initialization and Setup**:
  - The DSU is correctly initialized and used to manage connected components and their minimum edge weights.
  - The graph is constructed correctly using adjacency lists.

- **Edge Processing**:
  - The edges are processed in reverse order, ensuring that heavier edges are considered first. This helps in finding cycles more efficiently.

- **Cycle Detection**:
  - The DSU is used effectively to detect cycles and update the minimum edge weight.
  - The DFS function correctly finds the cycle and returns the path.

- **Output**:
  - The output format is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion

After carefully reviewing the program and the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the required functionality and adheres to the problem constraints.

**Final: True**

The program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem constraints.
