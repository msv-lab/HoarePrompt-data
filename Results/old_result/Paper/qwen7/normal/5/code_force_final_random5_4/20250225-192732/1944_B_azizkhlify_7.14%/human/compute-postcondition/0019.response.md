Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n`
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.

### Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `n + 1`.

Since the loop condition is `i < 2 * n`, as long as `i` is within this range, the loop will continue to execute. However, the only state that changes directly due to the loop head is `i`.

### Adjusted State
- `i` will be `n + 1`
- `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop head.

### Final State
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
