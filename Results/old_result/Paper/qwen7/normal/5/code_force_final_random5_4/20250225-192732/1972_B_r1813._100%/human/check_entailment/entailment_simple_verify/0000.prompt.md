You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer equal to `data[0] - 3`, `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the final string `s`, `n` is now `int(data[index + 4])`, `s` is now `data[index + 3]`, and `index` is increased by 6 for each iteration, ending at `index` being increased by 6 * 3 = 18.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced by 3, reflecting the number of times the loop has run. The value of `count_u` will be the total number of 'U' characters in the final string `s` after all iterations. The variable `n` will be set to `int(data[6])` (since `index` starts at 1 and increases by 6 each time), and `s` will be `data[6]`. The variable `index` will be increased by 18 in total, aligning with the pattern of increasing by 6 for each of the 3 iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game's rules. Specifically, it does not account for the removal of a coin and the flipping of its adjacent coins. Instead, it simply counts the number of 'U' characters in the string and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. This approach is incorrect because:

- The program does not remove the chosen coin from the string.
- The program does not flip the adjacent coins after removing the chosen coin.
- The program does not handle the special case where only two coins are left, and one of them is removed without flipping.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
5
UUDUD
5
UDDUD
2
UU
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
NO
```

However, the program outputs:
```
YES
NO
NO
```

For the first test case "UUDUD":
- Alice chooses the first coin, so the string becomes "DDUU".
- Bob chooses the last coin, so the string becomes "UU".
- Alice chooses the first coin, so the string becomes "U".
- Bob chooses the only coin, so the string becomes empty.
- Alice wins, but the program incorrectly prints "YES".

This shows that the program does not correctly implement the game's rules, hence it is incorrect.
