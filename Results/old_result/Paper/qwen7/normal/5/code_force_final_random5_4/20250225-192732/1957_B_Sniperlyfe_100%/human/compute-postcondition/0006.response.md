Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - nums[1]`, `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains 1 since no changes were made to it. The value of `n` remains greater than 1 as there was no operation affecting its condition. The value of `k` is decreased by `nums[i]`, which is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. The value of `nums[i]` remains unchanged as it was only referenced but not modified.
