Output State: **`total_count` is 0, `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()` and is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding to it the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, where `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()` and is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 3. The other variables (`total_count` and `num_of_lens`) remain unchanged.
