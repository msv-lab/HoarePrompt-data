Output State: **`start` is -1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the sum of all unique absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list `lst` from the last element to the first element, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference found during the loop's execution, and `d2[start]` (which is `d2[-1]`) is assigned the final value of `s`. `m` is an input integer.**

The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
