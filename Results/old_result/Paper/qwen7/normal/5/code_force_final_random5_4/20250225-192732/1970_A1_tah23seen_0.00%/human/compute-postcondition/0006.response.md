Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `d[1]` is 1, and `s[i]` is '('**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d[i + 1]` to be `d[i] + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `d[i + 1]` becomes `d[1]`, and since `d[0]` is not specified, we assume it to be 0 (common default value). Thus, `d[1]` is set to `0 + 1`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
