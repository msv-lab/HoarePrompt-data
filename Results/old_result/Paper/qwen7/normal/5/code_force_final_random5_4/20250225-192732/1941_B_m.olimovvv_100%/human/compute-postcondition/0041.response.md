Output State: **`b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code decreases the value of `b[i + 2]` by `b[i]`. The value of `b[i + 1]` was already modified by the previous line of code, which decreased its value by `2 * b[i]`. Both these modifications are reflected in the output state.
