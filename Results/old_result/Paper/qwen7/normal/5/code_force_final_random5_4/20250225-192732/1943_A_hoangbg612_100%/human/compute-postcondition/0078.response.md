Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than `cur`, `cur` is equal to `num`, and M[cur] is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to the element in the dictionary `M` at the key `cur`. Since `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[num]` is set to 1. The values of `num` and `cur` remain unchanged from their initial state.
