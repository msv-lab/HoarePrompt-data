Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is 0, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is an input integer, `i` must be between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `success` is True, `position` is the position of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the i-th monster.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `health` to the variable `bullets_needed`. Since `health` represents the health of the i-th monster, `bullets_needed` now holds this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
