Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user plus one, `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**

The code `first_row = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `first_row`. This does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged.
