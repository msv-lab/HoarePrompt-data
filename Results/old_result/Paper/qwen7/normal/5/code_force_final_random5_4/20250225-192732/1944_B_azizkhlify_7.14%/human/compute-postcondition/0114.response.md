Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, it only indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged from their initial conditions unless the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` was already met before the `break` statement was executed.
