Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `i` is n+1, `ones[n]` is the sum of 1's in `nums` up to index n-1, `sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` minus the count of 1's in `nums`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n+1`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of 1's encountered so far in the `nums` list, with the last element being the total count of 1's in the entire list. The `sum` list will store the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums`, adjusted by subtracting the count of 1's, with the last element being the final adjusted sum.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer from input, `r` is an integer from input, and if `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, then the condition holds. Otherwise, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l]`, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` equals `r`, and the final condition is either `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` or `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sumInRange` is now `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers input from the user, and the final condition is either `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` or `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
