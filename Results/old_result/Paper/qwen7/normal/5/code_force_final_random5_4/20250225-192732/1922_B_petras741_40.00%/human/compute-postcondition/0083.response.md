Output State: **`j` is 0; `n` is a non-negative integer; `q[j]` is greater than 0; `eta` contains the value 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` (which is 0) to the list `eta`. The values of `n` and `q[j]` remain unchanged, and `j` itself does not change. Therefore, `eta` now includes the value 0.
