Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of string `s`. The list `d` will have a length of `n-1`, with each element `d[j]` representing the cumulative balance of parentheses up to index `j-1` of string `s`. Specifically, `d[0]` will still be 0, and for every `j` from 1 to `n-1`, `d[j]` will be calculated based on whether `s[j-1]` is '(' or ')'. If `s[j-1]` is '(', `d[j]` will be `d[j-1] + 1`; if `s[j-1]` is ')', `d[j]` will be `d[j-1] - 1`.**

In this output state, the list `d` has been modified to remove its last element, which was the cumulative balance at index `n-1` of the string `s`. All other elements and their values remain unchanged according to the described conditions.
