Output State: **`e` must contain at least one character, `P` is either 1 or 0, `M` is now 1, `i` is `len(e) + 1`, `q` is the second-to-last character of `e`, `s` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The value of `M` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 0 or 1 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
