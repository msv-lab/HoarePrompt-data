Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int, `val` is an empty list before the loop starts, and if `l3` is not a list of the remaining integers where each element is different from `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
