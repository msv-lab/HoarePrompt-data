Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is -1, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `M` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cur` is either -1 or equal to `num`, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary. If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`, and `M` is updated to contain the key `cur` with value 1. If `num <= cur` or `num > cur + 1`, then `cur` remains -1 and `M` contains the key -1 with value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is either -1 or equal to `num` if `num > cur`. If `cur` was -1, it is now updated to `next_num`. If `cur` was equal to `num`, it remains unchanged. `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, and `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was updated, or the key `next_num` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 and updated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is either -1 or equal to the next element in `N`. `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, and `M[cur]` is 2 if `cur` was updated, or `M[next_num]` is 2 if `cur` was -1 and updated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
