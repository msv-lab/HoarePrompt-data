Output State: **`eta` is a list containing `n + 2`, `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` is a non-negative integer.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given that `j` is defined as `n + 2`, `eta` will contain the value `n + 2`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and `n` is still a non-negative integer.
