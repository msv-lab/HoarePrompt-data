You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: Output State: All inputs to the loop have been processed, and for each input, the output is a string in the format "h1:mm AM/PM". Here, `h1` is the adjusted hour part of the input time, `mm` is the original minute part of the time, and `AM/PM` is determined based on the value of `h1`. Specifically:
    #
    #- If `h1` is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', or '09', the time is in the AM period.
    #- If `h1` is '10', '11', or '12', the time is in the PM period.
    #
    #The variable `t` has been decremented to zero after all iterations of the loop have completed. The variables `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`, and `time` reflect the final processed input from the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple time inputs in 24-hour format and converts them to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. For each input, it prints the time in the format "h1:mm AM/PM", where `h1` is the adjusted hour, `mm` is the minute, and `AM/PM` is determined based on the adjusted hour. After processing all inputs, the function ensures that all time conversions are correctly displayed according to the 12-hour clock system.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program attempts to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
3. For each test case, it splits the input string `hh:mm` into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute).
4. The program then tries to convert the hour part (`h`) to the corresponding 12-hour format and sets the appropriate AM/PM indicator.
5. However, there are several issues with this approach:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to manually convert each possible 24-hour hour value to its 12-hour equivalent. This is inefficient and error-prone.
   - There's no handling for the case where the hour is `12` in 24-hour format, which corresponds to `12` in 12-hour format but can also be `12 AM` or `12 PM`.
   - The program does not handle the case when the hour is `00`, which should be `12 PM` in 12-hour format.
6. A more efficient and correct way would be to use simple arithmetic operations to determine the 12-hour equivalent and the AM/PM indicator.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly convert all possible 24-hour times to their 12-hour equivalents.
