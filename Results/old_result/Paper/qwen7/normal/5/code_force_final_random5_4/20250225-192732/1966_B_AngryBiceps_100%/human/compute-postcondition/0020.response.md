Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being an input provided by the user during the respective iteration of the loop.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in the list `a`, repeated according to their position in the list (i.e., the last character of the first string appears once, the last character of the second string appears twice, and so on).
- `i` is `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `n` remains as the initial input provided by the user.
- `first_row` and `last_row` reflect the cumulative concatenations as described.
- The first element of `a` consists of a single unique character.
- The last element of `a` also consists of a single unique character.
- The first and last elements of `a` are different.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
