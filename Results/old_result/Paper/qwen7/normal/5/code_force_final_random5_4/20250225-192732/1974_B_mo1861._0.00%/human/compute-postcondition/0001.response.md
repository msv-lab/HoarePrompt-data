Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `b` is at most 2 * 10^5; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. This dictionary will be used later to map characters from the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. However, no changes are made to the string `b` or its length, nor are any changes made to the initial state of the `char_map` dictionary. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `char_map` dictionary, which is initially empty.
