Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `y`, which is iterating over the range from `x - 1` down to `2` (since the step is `-1`).

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `2` and less than `x`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **Initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` and `y` are integers. The postcondition states that if `x` is divisible by `y` and `2 * y` is less than `x`, then `max_val` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.
   - **Current state**: We need to determine the new value of `y` for the next iteration.

4. **Calculate the new value of `y`**:
   - Since the loop iterates in reverse order, the new value of `y` will be `y - 1`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `2` and less than `x`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `y` is decreased by 1.
   - `max_val` remains unchanged unless the current `y` satisfies the conditions in the loop body.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `x` remains the same.
- `y` is decreased by 1.
- `max_val` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is `y - 1`, `max_val` is unchanged**.
