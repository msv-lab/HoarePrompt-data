Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n + (n - 1)`, `n` must be greater than 0. If the character at index `i` in `template` is not a lowercase letter, then `match_c` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter, no change is made to `match_c` and the loop continues as normal.
