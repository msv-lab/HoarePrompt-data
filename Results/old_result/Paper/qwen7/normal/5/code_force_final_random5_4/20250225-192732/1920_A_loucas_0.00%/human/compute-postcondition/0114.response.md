Output State: **`i` is `min(less) + 1`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, `num` is `min(less) + 1`, and `big` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns an empty list to the variable `big`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `max(big)`, `num`, or `less`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and `big` is now an empty list.
