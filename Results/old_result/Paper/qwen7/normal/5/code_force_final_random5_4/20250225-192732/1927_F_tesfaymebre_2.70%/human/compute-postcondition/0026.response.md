Output State: **`colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `nei` appended to it, `res` is a set containing the elements of the original `res` list, `set_res` is the set created from `res`.**

Explanation: The line `set_res = set(res)` creates a set from the list `res` and assigns it to the variable `set_res`. The values of `colors[curr]`, `curr`, `parent`, `path`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
