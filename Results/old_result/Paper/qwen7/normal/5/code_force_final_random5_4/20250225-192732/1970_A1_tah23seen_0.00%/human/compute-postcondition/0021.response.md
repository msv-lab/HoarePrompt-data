Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of string `s`. The list `d` will have a length of `n`, with each element `d[j]` representing the cumulative balance of parentheses up to index `j-1` of string `s`. Specifically, `d[0]` will still be 0, and for every `j` from 1 to `n`, `d[j]` will be calculated based on whether `s[j-1]` is '(' or ')'. If `s[j-1]` is '(', `d[j]` will be `d[j-1] + 1`; if `s[j-1]` is ')', `d[j]` will be `d[j-1] - 1`.

This means `d` will contain the balance of open and close parentheses as we traverse the string `s` from start to end.
