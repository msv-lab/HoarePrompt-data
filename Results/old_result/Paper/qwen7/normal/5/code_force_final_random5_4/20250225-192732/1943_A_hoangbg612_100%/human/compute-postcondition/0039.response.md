Output State: `cur` is the last element in the list `N`, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `N` that was greater than `cur` at some point during the loop, and the value for each such key is 1. For any `num` in `N` that was not greater than `cur`, the value in `M` is 2.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be the largest element in the list `N` because the loop increments `cur` only when it finds a number greater than `cur + 1`. The dictionary `M` will contain keys for all elements in `N` that were greater than `cur` at some point, with each value set to 1, and for all other elements, the value will be 2.
