The only objects in the loop head are variables `n` and `_`, but since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only relevant variable is `n`. According to the code, the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

Given that `n` is an integer within the specified range and the loop will decrement `i` until it reaches 0, the value of `n` remains unchanged for the next iteration unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not indicated here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should remain the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is 0**
