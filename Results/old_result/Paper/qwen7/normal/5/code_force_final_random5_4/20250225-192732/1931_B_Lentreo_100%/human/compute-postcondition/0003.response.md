Output State: **The program returns 'NO'**

Given the initial state, `n` is the length of `nums`, and `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`. It is also mentioned that the current value of `total % n` is not equal to 0. The code snippet provided simply returns the string `'NO'`. Since no other operations are performed on the variables and the return statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `total`, the program will return the string `'NO'` directly.
