Based on the initial state described, let's break down the components and the calculation of `res`:

1. **num_of_lens**: This dictionary contains the count of each integer found in the `nums` list after the loop has executed all its iterations. For example, if `nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, then `num_of_lens` might look like `{1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 4}`.

2. **math.comb(cnt, 3)**: This calculates the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of `cnt` elements. It is used for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.

3. **math.comb(cnt, 2)**: This calculates the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of `cnt` elements. It is used for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.

4. **total_sum**: This is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`. So, if `num_of_lens = {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 4}`, then `total_sum` would be `3 + 4 = 7` (excluding the `cnt` itself).

Given these details, `res` is calculated as follows:
- Sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.
- Sum of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, with `total_sum` being the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`.

Let's assume an example `nums` list to illustrate this:
```python
nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```

After processing, `num_of_lens` might be:
```python
num_of_lens = {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 4}
```

Now, calculating `res`:
- For `cnt = 3` (from `num_of_lens[3]`):
  - `math.comb(3, 3) = 1`
  - `math.comb(3, 2) * (3 + 2 + 4 - 3) = 3 * 6 = 18`
- For `cnt = 2` (from `num_of_lens[2]`):
  - `math.comb(2, 2) * (3 + 4 - 2) = 1 * 5 = 5`

So, `res` would be:
```python
res = 1 + 18 + 5 = 24
```

Therefore, the output of the `print(res)` statement will be the computed value of `res`.

Output: **24**
