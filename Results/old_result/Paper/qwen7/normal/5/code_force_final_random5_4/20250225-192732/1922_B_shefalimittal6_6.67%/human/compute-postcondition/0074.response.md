Output State: **`num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `total_sum` is now the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`; `total_sum` is updated to sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the current `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` updates the value of `res` by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum`. The variables `num_of_lens`, `cnt`, and `total_sum` remain in their respective states as described in the initial state, with `num_of_lens` containing at least one key-value pair, `cnt` being the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` being the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`.
