Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is equal to `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `last_year` to the list `results`. Since `last_year` is updated in the loop and the loop has completed its execution, the final value of `last_year` is used to create a string and append it to `results`. The values of `i` and `last_year` are updated as described in the initial state, and `results` now contains the string representation of the final `last_year` value.
