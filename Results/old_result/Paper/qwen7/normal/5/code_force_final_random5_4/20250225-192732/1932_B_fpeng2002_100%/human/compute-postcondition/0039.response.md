Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums))`. The only variable involved here is `x`.

2. **Determine the current state of `x`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 0). Therefore, `x` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Consider the state of other variables**: Since `x` is the only variable in the loop head, no other variables need to be adjusted.

6. **Formulate the new state**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 2**
