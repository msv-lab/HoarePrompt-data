Output State: **`list2` is a sorted version of the original list1.**

Explanation: The code `list2.sort()` sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. Since `list2` initially contains the integer conversion of all elements from `list1`, after sorting, `list2` will contain the same integers as before but in sorted order. The initial state's information about `list1` remains valid, but `list2` is now sorted.
