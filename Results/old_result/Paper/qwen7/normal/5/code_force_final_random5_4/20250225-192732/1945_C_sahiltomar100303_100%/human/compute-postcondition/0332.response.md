Output State: **`right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0.**

The code initializes `leftZero` to 0, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `right`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states.
