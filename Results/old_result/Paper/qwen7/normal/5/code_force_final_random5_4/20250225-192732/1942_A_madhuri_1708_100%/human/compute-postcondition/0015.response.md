Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, and if `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the condition remains unchanged; if `k` is less than 2, the condition also remains unchanged.
