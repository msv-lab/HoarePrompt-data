Output State: `t` is a value between 1 and 1000, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `i` in range(t) and `i` will reach `t-1`), `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user for each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, regardless of the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` being met or not, the values of `t` and `i` will be as described, and `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the last set of values entered by the user before the loop terminates.
