Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`, `position` is the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `health` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed` from the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The line `success = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `success`. None of the other variables (`monsters`, `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, `bullets_needed`, `total_bullets_used`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
