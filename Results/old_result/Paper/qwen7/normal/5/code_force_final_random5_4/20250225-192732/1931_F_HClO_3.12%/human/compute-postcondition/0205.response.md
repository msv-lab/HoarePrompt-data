Output State: **We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. No variables are updated or changed by this statement, so their states remain as they were in the initial state. The conditions and relationships between the variables (like the equations involving `n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `l2`, `a1`, and `a2`) still hold true.
