Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is False, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`. The values of `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
