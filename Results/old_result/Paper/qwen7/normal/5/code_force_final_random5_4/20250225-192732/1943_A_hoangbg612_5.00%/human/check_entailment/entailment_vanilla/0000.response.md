Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `T` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `S` (which should be `N` in this context) is read as the size of the array.
   - `N` is read as the array of integers.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - `N.sort()` sorts the array in ascending order.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `cur = -1` initializes the current MEX candidate.
   - `M = {}` initializes a dictionary to keep track of the counts of numbers used.

4. **Processing the Array:**
   - Iterate through each number in the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number (`num`) is greater than `cur`, check if it can be the next MEX candidate.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, increment `cur` and break the loop.
     - Otherwise, set `cur` to `num` and mark it in the dictionary `M`.
   - If the current number is not greater than `cur`, increment the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - Check if the sum of values in the dictionary `M` equals `S` (the size of the array).
   - If so, increment `cur` by 1.
   - Iterate from 0 to `cur` to find the smallest number that is not fully used (i.e., its count is less than or equal to the number itself).

6. **Output:**
   - Print the final value of `cur`, which represents the MEX of the array `c`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **MEX Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program tries to find gaps in the sequence but does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob make optimal moves.
   - The program does not account for the different strategies Alice and Bob might use to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively.

2. **Game Strategy:**
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The program does not simulate these strategies; instead, it tries to find a gap in the sorted array, which is not aligned with the game rules.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might have repeated elements or specific patterns that affect the MEX calculation.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It attempts to find gaps in a sorted array rather than simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: **False**
