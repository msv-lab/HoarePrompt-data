Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in nums`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition states that `curr` is updated to its previous value plus the difference between the current value of `i` and the last value of `i`. This means that `curr` is being updated within the loop, but the focus here is on adjusting the loop head variables.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now the second element of `nums`.
   - `i` is not equal to 0.
   - `nums` is the list without the first element.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that the loop can continue with the next element in `nums`. Therefore, the next element in `nums` should be considered as the starting point for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is now the second element of `nums`, the next element (third element) should be the starting point for the next iteration.
   - `nums` should be the list without the first two elements (since `i` is now the second element).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is the third element of `nums`, `nums` is the list without the first two elements.**

However, since we need to provide the state in a specific format, we can summarize it as follows:

**State: `i` is the third element of `nums`, `nums` is the list without the first two elements.**
