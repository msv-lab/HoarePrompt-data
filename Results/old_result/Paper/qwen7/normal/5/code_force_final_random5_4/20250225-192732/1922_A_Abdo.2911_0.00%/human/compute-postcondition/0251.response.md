Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True`, `t` is reduced by 1, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `template` is a list containing elements from `a` where characters match those in `b` as they are, and upper-cased versions of characters where they do not match.**

Explanation:
- The line `match_a_b = True` sets `match_a_b` to `True`.
- The precondition states that `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` will be exactly equal to `n` after the loop. Since the assignment does not affect `n` or `i`, these values remain unchanged.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `template` remain as described in the precondition because the assignment does not modify them.
