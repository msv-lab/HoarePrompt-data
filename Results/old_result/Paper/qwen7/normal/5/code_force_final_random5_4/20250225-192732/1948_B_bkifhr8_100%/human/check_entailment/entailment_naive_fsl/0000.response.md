Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the array can be made sorted by repeatedly applying the operation to elements that are at least 10. The program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and then attempts to split the previous element, but it does not ensure that the resulting array is sorted after each operation. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program will check the elements from the end to the beginning. When it reaches `67` and compares it with `45`, it will fail because `67 > 45`. However, the correct approach would be to split `45` into `[4, 5]` and then compare the new array `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`. This new array can be sorted by further splitting and rearranging elements.

The program does not account for the possibility of making the array sorted through multiple operations, and it incorrectly returns `NO` for this case. Therefore, the program is not correct.
