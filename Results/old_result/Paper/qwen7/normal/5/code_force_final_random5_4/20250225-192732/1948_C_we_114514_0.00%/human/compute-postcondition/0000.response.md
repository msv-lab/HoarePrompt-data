Output State: **`results` is an empty list, t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; each test case in test_cases is a list containing three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid, where each string consists of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>'.**

Explanation: The line `results = []` initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the value of `t` or the contents of `test_cases`. Therefore, the only change is that `results` is now an empty list, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
