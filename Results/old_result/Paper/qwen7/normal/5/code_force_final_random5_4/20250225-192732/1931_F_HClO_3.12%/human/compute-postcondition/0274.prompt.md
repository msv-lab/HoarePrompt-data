Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations; `val` is either an empty list or a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then `l2` is updated by inserting `a2` at index `idx1`, and `val` remains unchanged. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, then `val` may contain one tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `m` is decreased by 1 if `idx1` is not strictly greater than `idx2`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be greater than 2; `a3` is the first integer from input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input; `val` is a list containing a tuple `(a3, l3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing a tuple (`a3`, `l3`) appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing a tuple (`a3`, `l3`) appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
