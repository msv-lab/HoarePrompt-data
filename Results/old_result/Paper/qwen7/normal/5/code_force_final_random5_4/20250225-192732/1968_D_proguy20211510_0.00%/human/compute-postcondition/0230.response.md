Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and an additional element `(k - 4) * maxa`, `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa`, the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`, and now includes an additional element which is `a[ps - 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of list `s`, which is `a[ps - 1]`, to itself. Since `s` already contains `(k - 2) * maxa` and the last element is `a[ps - 1]`, after appending `a[ps - 1]` again, `s` now includes this element twice. All other variables remain unchanged.
