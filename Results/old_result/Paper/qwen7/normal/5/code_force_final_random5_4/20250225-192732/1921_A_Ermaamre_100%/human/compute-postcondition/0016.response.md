Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must be 0; `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers entered by the user for each iteration, `x` is a list of the first elements from each of the 4 lists in `a` for each iteration, and `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x` for each iteration. The final output will consist of the value of `dx * dx` printed for each iteration.**

This means that after all iterations, if `t` was originally greater than 0, it would have been decremented to 0 by the loop. For each of the `t` iterations, `a` is processed to extract the first element from each of the 4 lists, find the difference between the maximum and minimum of these first elements, and then square this difference to print it. If `t` was initially 0 or less, no iterations occur, and the state remains as described for after 3 iterations.
