### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array and calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because sorting ensures that the largest differences are between the smallest and largest elements, which maximizes the sum of the absolute differences.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The logic in the function is correct and follows the optimal strategy.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input parsing and ensures that the results are printed in the required format.
   - The logic in the function is also correct and follows the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles arrays of different lengths and values within the specified range.
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results for each case.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
