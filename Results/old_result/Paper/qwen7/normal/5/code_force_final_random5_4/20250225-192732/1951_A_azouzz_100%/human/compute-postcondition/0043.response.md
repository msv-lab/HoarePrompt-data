Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`, `s` is a new string input by the user.**

The code `s = input()` takes a new string input by the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `cnt1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
