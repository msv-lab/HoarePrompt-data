Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 4`, `m` must be at least 3, `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block it was inside, but it does not change the values of the variables `ans`, `i`, `m`, `arr[i - 1]`, or `nums`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
