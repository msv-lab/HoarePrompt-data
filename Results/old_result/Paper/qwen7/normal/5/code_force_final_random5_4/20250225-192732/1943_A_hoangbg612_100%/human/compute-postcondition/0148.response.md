Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know from the postcondition that:
   - `num` is the first element of `N`.
   - `N` must contain at least one element.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `M[cur]` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
   - Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `num` is the first element of `N`.
   - `N` must contain at least one element.
   - If `num` was greater than `cur + 1`, `M[cur]` would be set to 1 and the loop would break.
   - Otherwise, `M[cur]` would be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the first element of `N`, after processing `num`, `num` will be the second element of `N` (if `N` had more than one element).
   - `N` will still contain at least one element because it must initially contain at least one element and the loop continues as long as there are elements in `N`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `num` will be the second element of `N` (if `N` had more than one element).
   - `N` will still contain at least one element.

Given these points, the new state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`num` is the second element of `N`, and `N` must contain at least one element**.
