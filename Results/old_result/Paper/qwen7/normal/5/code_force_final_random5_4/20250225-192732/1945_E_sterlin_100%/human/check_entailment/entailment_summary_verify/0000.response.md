### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not implement the required functionality. The code defines several utility functions for reading input but does not include the logic to rearrange the permutation and perform the binary search as specified. 

However, the original assessment concludes with the statement "Therefore, the correctness is **False**." This conclusion is accurate based on the given problem description and the current state of the code. The code does not meet the requirements of the problem because it lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem.

Given the problem description and the current state of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program indeed does not implement the required functionality.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
