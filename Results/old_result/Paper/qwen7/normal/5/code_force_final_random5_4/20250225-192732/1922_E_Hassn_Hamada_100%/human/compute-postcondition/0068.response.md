Output State: `size` is 5, `overlap` is 2, `value` is 30, `i` is 3, `sequence` contains [2, 4, 6].

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - overlap - 1`, which means it will run from `i = 0` to `i = 3` (since `size` is 5 and `overlap` is 2). After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be 3. The `sequence` list will contain the values `[2, 4, 6]`, as each iteration appends `i + overlap` to the list, starting from `2` (when `i = 0`) and ending with `6` (when `i = 3`).
