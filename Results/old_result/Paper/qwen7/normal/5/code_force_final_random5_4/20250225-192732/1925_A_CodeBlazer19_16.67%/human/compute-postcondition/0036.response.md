Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` from 97 to `k + 97 - 1`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: From the given state, `j` is currently set to 195.

4. **Check if the loop can execute with the current state**:
   - The loop will start when `j` is 97.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k + 97 - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must reach 97 at some point during the iterations.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `j` is currently 195, it is already past the starting point of 97. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `j` itself.
   - We need to ensure that `k` is such that the loop can run. Specifically, `k` must be large enough so that `j` (starting from 195) can eventually reach 97 and continue iterating up to `k + 97 - 1`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` must be such that the loop can execute (i.e., `k` must be at least 98), `s` is an empty string, `j` is 195, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
