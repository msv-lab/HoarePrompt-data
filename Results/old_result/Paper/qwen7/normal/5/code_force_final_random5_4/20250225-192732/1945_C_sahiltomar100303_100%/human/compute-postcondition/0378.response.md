Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 (rightZero is now rightZero + 1)**

The code increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `mid + 1`, `n` must still be greater than `mid + 1`, and `rightZero` is now one more than its previous value.
