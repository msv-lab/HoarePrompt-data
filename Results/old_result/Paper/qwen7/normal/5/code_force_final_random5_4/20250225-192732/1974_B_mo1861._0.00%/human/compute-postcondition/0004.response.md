Output State: **`b` must contain at least one unique character, `i` is 0, `c` is the first unique character in the sorted form of `b`, `char_map[c]` is assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`**.

This means that the character map for `c` (which is the first unique character in the sorted form of `b`) is set to a specific character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 1))`. The values of `b`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the new assignment for `char_map[c]` is included in the output state.
