Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length \(n\), `letters` is a list containing all characters from `password` that are not digits plus the character `ch`, and `digits` is a list containing all characters from `password` that are digits.**

Explanation: The code appends the character `ch` to the `letters` list. The `digits` list remains unchanged since no digit-related operations were performed. The `password` string and its length `n` remain the same.
