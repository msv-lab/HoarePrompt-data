Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `t` is `n-1`
   - `l` is 'YES'
   - `c` is the input from the user
   - If `a[1]` is not equal to `c[1]` and `b[1]` is not equal to `c[1]`, then `l` remains 'YES'.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (i.e., `i` becomes 2).
   - The value of `n` does not change based on the loop head alone; it remains as it was at the start of the current iteration.
   - The values of `t`, `l`, `c`, `a[1]`, and `b[1]` are not affected by the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` changes to 2
- `n` remains the same (greater than 1)
- `t` remains `n-1`
- `l` remains 'YES'
- `c` remains the input from the user
- `a[1]` and `b[1]` remain unchanged

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `t` is `n-1`, `l` is 'YES', `c` is the input from the user, and if `a[1]` is not equal to `c[1]` and `b[1]` is not equal to `c[1]`, then `l` remains 'YES'**
