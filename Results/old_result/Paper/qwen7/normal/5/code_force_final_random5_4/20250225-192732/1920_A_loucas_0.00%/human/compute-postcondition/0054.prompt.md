Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations. `loop` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive; `iterable` is 1; `less` is a list containing the input integers `a` zero to three times; `big` is a list containing the input integers `a` twice; `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]` once; `num` is 0; `x` is the first input integer; `a` is the second input integer; `iterable2` ranges from 0 to `innerLoop-1`; `innerLoop` is the same as before.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `less` will contain up to three input integers `a`, `big` will contain exactly two input integers `a`, `no` will contain up to one input integer `a`, and `iterable` will be 1. The values of `num`, `x`, `a`, `iterable2`, and `innerLoop` will reflect the last inputs provided during the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `less` contains at least one element, `big` contains at least one element, and `max(big)` is greater than or equal to `min(less)`. If `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `less` contains at least one element, `big` contains at least one element, `max(big)` is greater than or equal to `min(less)`, and `i` is `max(big) + 1`. If `i` is not in `no`, then `num` is set to `max(big) + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is in `no`, the condition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `less` contains at least one element, `big` contains at least one element, `max(big)` is greater than or equal to `min(less)`, and if `i` (which is `max(big)`) is not in `no`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
