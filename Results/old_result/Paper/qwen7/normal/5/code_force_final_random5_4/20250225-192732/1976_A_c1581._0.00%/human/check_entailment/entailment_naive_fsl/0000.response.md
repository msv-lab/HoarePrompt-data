Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both letters and digits are present in the password and need to be checked for sorting independently. Specifically, the program checks the digits and letters separately but does not ensure that the sequence of characters in the password respects the conditions for both digits and letters together.

For example, consider the password "12a3". According to the problem description, this password should be "NO" because the digit '3' comes after the letter 'a'. However, the current implementation does not check the sequence of characters in the password to ensure that digits are in non-decreasing order and letters are in non-decreasing order consecutively. The program only checks if the digits and letters are sorted separately, which is insufficient.

To fix this, the program needs to iterate through the password and ensure that:
1. Digits are in non-decreasing order.
2. Letters are in non-decreasing order.
3. There is no digit that comes after a letter.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    last_digit_index = -1
    last_letter_index = -1
    prev_char = None
    
    for i, char in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            if last_letter_index != -1 and last_letter_index > i:
                return 'NO'
            if prev_char is not None and prev_char > char:
                return 'NO'
            last_digit_index = i
            prev_char = char
        else:
            if last_digit_index != -1 and last_digit_index < i:
                return 'NO'
            if prev_char is not None and prev_char > char:
                return 'NO'
            last_letter_index = i
            prev_char = char
    
    # Check if digits are sorted
    if last_digit_index != -1 and prev_char.isdigit() and prev_char < password[last_digit_index]:
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if letters are sorted
    if last_letter_index != -1 and prev_char.isalpha() and prev_char < password[last_letter_index]:
        return 'NO'
    
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected version ensures that the sequence of characters in the password respects the conditions for both digits and letters together.
