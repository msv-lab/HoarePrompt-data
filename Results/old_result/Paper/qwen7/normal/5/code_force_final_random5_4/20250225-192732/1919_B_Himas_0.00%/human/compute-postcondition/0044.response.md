Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `q` and `e`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**:
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - `q` is the second character of `e`.
   - If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. Otherwise, `M` is 2.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `e` remains a non-empty string because the length of `e` does not change within the loop.
   - `q` will now be the third character of `e` (since the loop advances to the next character).

4. **Adjust the states based on the new value of `q`**:
   - If `q` was '+' in the previous iteration, it means `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. For the next iteration, `q` will be the third character. We need to check if this new `q` is '+' or not.
   - If the new `q` is '+', then `P` will be 2 and `M` will be 1.
   - If the new `q` is not '+', then `M` will be 2.

Since we don't know the exact value of the third character, we can only adjust the states based on the possible values of `q`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the third character of `e`, `P` is 2 if the third character is '+', otherwise `M` is 2.**

However, to provide a concrete answer, we need to consider both scenarios:

- If the third character is '+':
  - `P` is 2
  - `M` is 1
- If the third character is not '+':
  - `M` is 2

Given the format required, we can present the state as follows:

State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the third character of `e`, `P` is 2 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` is 2**
