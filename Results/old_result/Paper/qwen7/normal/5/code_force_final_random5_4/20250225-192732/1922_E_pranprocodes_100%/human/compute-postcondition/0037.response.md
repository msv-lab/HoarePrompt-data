Output State: `i` is 0, `t` is the total number of iterations, `x` is 1, `max` is 0, `min` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all integers from 100000000 down to 0 or from -100000000 up to 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. In each iteration, if `x` is even, `max` decreases by 1; if `x` is odd, `min` increases by 1. Eventually, `x` will reach 1, and the loop will terminate. Since `max` starts at 100000000 and decreases by 1 each time `x` is even, and `min` starts at -100000000 and increases by 1 each time `x` is odd, both `max` and `min` will eventually reach 0. The list `ans` will contain all integers from 100000000 down to 0 or from -100000000 up to 0, depending on whether `x` was even or odd more frequently during the iterations.
