Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not equal to '0'; `leftOne` is 1.**

The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially not specified, we assume it was 0 (as no other initial value was given). After executing the code, `leftOne` becomes 1. All other variables (`i`, `mid`, and `s[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
