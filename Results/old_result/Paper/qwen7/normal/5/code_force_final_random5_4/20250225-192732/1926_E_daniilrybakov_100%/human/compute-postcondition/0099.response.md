Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is the sum of `x` for each iteration.
   - `n` is reduced to `n // 2**3`, meaning `n` is divided by 8.
   - `k` is an input integer (unchanged).
   - `m` is 8 (since it doubles every iteration and does so 3 times).
   - `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` based on the final value of `n`.

2. **Determine the Final Value of `n`**:
   - Since `n` is reduced to `n // 2**3`, let's assume the initial value of `n` is `N`.
   - After the loop, `n` becomes `N // 8`.

3. **Determine the Final Value of `x`**:
   - `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - Substituting the final value of `n`, `x` becomes `((N // 8) + 1) // 2`.

4. **Determine the Sum `s`**:
   - `s` is the sum of `x` for each iteration.
   - Assuming the loop runs for `N // 8` iterations, `s` would be the sum of `((N // 8) + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
   - Simplifying, if `N // 8 = k`, then `s = k * ((k + 1) // 2)`.

5. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression to be printed is `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     (2 * (k - k * ((k + 1) // 2)) - 1) * 8
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     (2 * (k - k * ((k + 1) // 2)) - 1) * 8 = (2 * (k - k * ((k + 1) // 2)) - 1) * 8
     \]

6. **Simplify the Expression**:
   - Let's assume `k = 1` for simplicity (since `k` is an input integer and can be any value, but the expression simplifies nicely with small values):
     \[
     (2 * (1 - 1 * ((1 + 1) // 2)) - 1) * 8 = (2 * (1 - 1 * 1) - 1) * 8 = (2 * (1 - 1) - 1) * 8 = (2 * 0 - 1) * 8 = (-1) * 8 = -8
     \]

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **-8**
