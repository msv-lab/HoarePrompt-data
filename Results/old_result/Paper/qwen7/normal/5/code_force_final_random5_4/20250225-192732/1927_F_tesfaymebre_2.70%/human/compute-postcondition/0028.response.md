Postcondition: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `nei` appended to it, `res` is a set containing the elements of the original `res` list, `set_res` is the set created from `res`. If `node_v` is in `set_res` and `res` is not empty, the function returns a set containing the elements of the original `res` list. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.
