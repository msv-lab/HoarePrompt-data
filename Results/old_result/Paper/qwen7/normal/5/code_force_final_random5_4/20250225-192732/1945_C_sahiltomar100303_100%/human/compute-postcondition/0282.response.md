Output State: **`right` is equal to `right + 1`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(right + 2) // 2`, and `trightOne` is adjusted based on the value of `s[right]`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `trightOne` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tleftZero` remains the same and `tleftOne` is increased by 1 while `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `right` is incremented by 1. The values of `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are recalculated based on the new value of `right`. Specifically, `tleftZero` is updated to `(right + 2) // 2`. The adjustment to `trightOne` depends on the value of `s[right]`: if `s[right]` is '0', then `trightOne` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
