Output State: **`ptsb` now contains the new element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `ptss` now contains the new element `pres[i+1] + rem * s[i+1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ptsb`. This new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. The value of `rem` is updated to `k - (i + 1)` after this operation. The list `ptss` and its element remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code.
