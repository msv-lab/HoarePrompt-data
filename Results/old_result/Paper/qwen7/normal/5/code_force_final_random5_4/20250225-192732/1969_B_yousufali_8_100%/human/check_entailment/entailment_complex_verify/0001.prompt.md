You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (consisting only of '0's and '1's), and n is an integer representing the count of '1's encountered until the current index, initialized to 0. ans is an integer representing the total cost, also initialized to 0.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is an input string, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence of '0' in `s` followed by a '1', and `i` is the last index of the string `s`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will hold the total length of the string `s`. The variable `ans` will contain the count of segments in the string where a '0' is immediately followed by one or more '1's, plus one for each such segment. The variable `i` will be set to the index of the last character in the string `s`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each occurrence of '0' immediately followed by one or more '1's in s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a binary string `s`, counting the number of '1's encountered. It then calculates and returns the total cost `ans`, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence of '0' immediately followed by one or more '1's in the string. After processing the entire string, the function prints the total cost `ans`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a binary string s is provided on a new line where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and s consists only of '0' and '1'.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #In natural language: The value of `t` must be greater than 0 after the loop has executed all its iterations. This is because the loop continues to run as long as `t` is greater than 0, and since the loop has completed all its iterations, it means `t` was initially greater than 0 and has not been reduced to 0 or below within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1()` with a binary string `s` as input, where the length of `s` is between 2 and 200,000 characters, and `s` consists only of '0' and '1'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve a sorted string.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to count consecutive '1's and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - It iterates through the string:
     - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operations.
   - It simply counts the number of '0's followed by '1's and adds their positions plus one to the cost.
   - This approach does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the string "10", `func_1` will output 2, which is correct because a single cyclic shift is needed.
   - For the string "0000", `func_1` will output 0, which is also correct because no shifts are needed.
   - However, for more complex strings like "101011", the logic fails to calculate the correct minimum cost.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
