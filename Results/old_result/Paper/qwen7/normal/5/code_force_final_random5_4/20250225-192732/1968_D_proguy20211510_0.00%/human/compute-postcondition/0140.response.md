Output State: **`i` must be less than `len(pres)`, `rem` is now `k - i - 2`, `ptss` is a list with an additional element which is `pres[i] + (k - i - 2) * s[i]`, `ptsb` is a list with two additional elements which are `preb[i] + (k - i - 2) * b[i]` and `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `ptsb` list, which is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Since `rem` is defined as `k - i - 2`, the new element added to `ptsb` is `preb[i] + (k - i - 2) * b[i]`. The other variables (`i`, `rem`, `ptss`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The `ptss` list gains an additional element which is `pres[i] + (k - i - 2) * s[i]`, as mentioned in the initial state.
