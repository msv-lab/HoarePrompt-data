Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `i` is less than `n`. If `s[i]` equals '0', then `rightZero` is increased by `n - mid`. Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by `n - mid`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `left`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
