### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and the function summary to ensure its correctness:

1. **Letters Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order**:
   - The program collects all letters into the `letters` list and checks if they are sorted using `sorted(letters)`.
   - This ensures that all letters in the password are in alphabetical order.

2. **Digits Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order**:
   - The program collects all digits into the `digits` list and checks if they are sorted using `sorted(digits)`.
   - This ensures that all digits in the password are in numerical order.

3. **No Digit After Letter**:
   - The program iterates through the password and checks if a digit follows a letter.
   - If such a sequence is found, it immediately returns "NO".
   - This ensures that no digit appears after a letter in the password.

4. **Only Lowercase Latin Letters and Digits**:
   - The program inherently handles this condition by segregating letters and digits.
   - No additional checks are needed for this requirement since the input is already validated by the problem constraints.

Given these checks, the program correctly identifies whether a password is strong according to the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the function summary provided.
