Output State: **`idx1` is either `i` or `i + 1`, `idx2` is either `0` or `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`. It only indicates that the execution will exit the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain as they were initially defined, and we simply note that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
