Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `n` or `m`, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `n` and `m` are still positive integers within the specified range, and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
