Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `l` is a list containing at least one element. If `i <= k`, then `l` is updated to include `i` and `i` becomes the new maximum value in `l`. If `i > k`, then `l` remains unchanged with `ans` being the maximum value among the elements in `l`.
