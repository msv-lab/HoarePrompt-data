Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is greater than 0, `leftOne` is 3, if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2 and `tleftZero` is 3, otherwise `leftOne` is 3**

Explanation: The code increments `leftOne` by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
