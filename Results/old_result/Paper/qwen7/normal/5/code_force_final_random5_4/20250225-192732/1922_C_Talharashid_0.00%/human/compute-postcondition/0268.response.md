Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 1**.

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. Since the initial state of `end` is an integer entered by the user, after executing the code, `end` will be the original value of `end` minus 1. All other variables (`m`, `i`, and `start`) remain unchanged.
