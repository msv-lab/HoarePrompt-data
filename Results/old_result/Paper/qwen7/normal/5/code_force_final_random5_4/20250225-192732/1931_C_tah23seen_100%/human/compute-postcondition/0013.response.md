Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

2. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `arr[j]` (which indirectly involves the array `arr`).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is decreased by 1.

4. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `j > 0` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` must be true.
   - Since `j` is decreased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `j` as `j_new`.
   - The condition `j > 0` means `j_new > 0`.
   - The condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` means `arr[j_new] == arr[j_new - 1]` because `j` was just decreased by 1.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To ensure the loop continues, `j_new` must be greater than 0.
   - Additionally, `arr[j_new]` must be equal to `arr[j_new - 1]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` must be greater than 0 and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`**. 

This ensures that the loop condition `j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` is satisfied for the next iteration.
