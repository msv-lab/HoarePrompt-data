Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, and it is explicitly stated that `count` is equal to 2.
- `t` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output.
- `start` is an integer, but its exact value is not needed.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, but its exact value is not needed.
- `i` is 0, but its value is not relevant to the output.
- `n` is an input integer, but its value is not needed to determine the output.
- The index of the first '1' in `a` is found, and the next character after the first '1' is not '1'.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
