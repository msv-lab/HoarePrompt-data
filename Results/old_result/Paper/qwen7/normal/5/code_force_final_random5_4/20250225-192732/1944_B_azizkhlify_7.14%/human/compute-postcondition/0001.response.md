Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the inputs, the output state simply describes that `n` and `k` hold the values of the first and second integers from the input, respectively.
