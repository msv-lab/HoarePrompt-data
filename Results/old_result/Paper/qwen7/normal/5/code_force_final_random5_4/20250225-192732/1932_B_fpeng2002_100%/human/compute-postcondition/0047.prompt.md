You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: Output State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `start_year` is the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x-1] + 1) * nums[x-1]` for each `x` from 0 to the length of `nums` minus one, iteratively.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_tests` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and `x` will be equal to the length of `nums`. The variable `start_year` will be the final value obtained by successively applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x-1] + 1) * nums[x-1]` to each element in the `nums` list, starting from an initial `start_year` of 0 and iterating over all elements in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers. It first checks if the integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a list of n integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) are provided. Based on these inputs, it returns either an error message if t is out of range or a processed result related to the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
