Output: **NO**

Explanation: 
- The initial state tells us that `match_c` is either `False` or `True`.
- It also states that `i` is `3`.
- Additionally, `n` is greater than `3`.
- Most importantly, it mentions that `(match_a_b is True and match_c is True)`.

Given this, the print statement `print('NO')` will directly print the string `'NO'`. The conditions about `match_a_b` and `match_c` being true do not affect the execution of this specific print statement. Therefore, the output is simply `'NO'`.
