Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, it checks if the given integers meet the specified conditions (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4 for the number of test cases, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 for the size of each list, and 0 ≤ a_i < n for each element in the list). The function does not return any specific value but processes and validates the input according to the given constraints.**
