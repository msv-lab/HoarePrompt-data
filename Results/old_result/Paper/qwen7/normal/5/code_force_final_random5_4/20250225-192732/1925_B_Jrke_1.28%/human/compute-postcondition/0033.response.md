Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `l` is a list. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains three elements `['ans', i, x // i]`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`. If `i` is greater than `k`, then `l` remains as `['ans']`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`. Here, `ans` represents the maximum value found in the list `l` after considering the current value of `i` and the integer division of `x` by `i`.
