Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `inpstr` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, with at least one 'B' in the string, `outind` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `outind = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `outind`. The initial values of `ind1`, `ind2`, and `inpstr` remain unchanged. The precondition that `inpstr` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, with at least one 'B' in the string, is still valid.
