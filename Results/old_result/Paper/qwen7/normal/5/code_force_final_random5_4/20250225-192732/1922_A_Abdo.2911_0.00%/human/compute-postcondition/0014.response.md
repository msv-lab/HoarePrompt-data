Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `c` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `template` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `a[0]` or `a[i]` in uppercase and the second element is `a[i]` in uppercase, `i` is 2, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` if the condition `a[i] == b[i]` is false.**

Explanation: The code `template.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` (which is the same as `a[2]` since `i` is 2) to the list `template`. Since `a[2]` is not equal to `b[2]`, the condition `a[i] == b[i]` is false, and `a[2]` is appended to `template`. The other variables remain unchanged.
