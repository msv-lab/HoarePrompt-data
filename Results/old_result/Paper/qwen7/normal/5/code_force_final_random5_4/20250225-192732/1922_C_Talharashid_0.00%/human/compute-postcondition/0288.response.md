Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `end` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start < end`, or `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start >= end`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.
