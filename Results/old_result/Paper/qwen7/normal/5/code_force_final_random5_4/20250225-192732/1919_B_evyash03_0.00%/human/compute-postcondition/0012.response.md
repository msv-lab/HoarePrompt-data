Postcondition: **`expression` must have at least one character. `balance` is less than 0. If the current character `char` is '+', then `balance` is 1 more than its previous value. If the current character `char` is '-', then `balance` is decreased by 1. If the current character is neither '+' nor '-', `balance` remains unchanged.**
