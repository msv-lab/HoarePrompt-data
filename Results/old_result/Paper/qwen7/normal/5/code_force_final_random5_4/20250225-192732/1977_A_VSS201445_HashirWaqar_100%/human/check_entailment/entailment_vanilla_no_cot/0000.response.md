Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even, which ensures that the operations (putting and removing cubes) can balance out to result in exactly `m` cubes. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.
