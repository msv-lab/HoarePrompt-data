Postcondition: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is either incremented by 1 if it already exists, or added with a value of 1 if it does not exist. `res` remains unchanged, `total_count` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers (excluding the first element), and `x` is the second element in the updated `num_list`.**
