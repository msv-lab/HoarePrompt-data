Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop iterates over the values of `cnt.values()`, meaning the loop variable is `x`.

2. **Identify the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is increased by `x // 3`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop variable `x` is being used in the expression to update `ans`.
   - The loop condition depends on the values of `x` from `cnt.values()`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be one of the remaining keys in `cnt.values()`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `ans` is updated based on `x // 3`, we need to know the new value of `ans` after the next iteration.
   - We also need to know the new value of `x` for the next iteration.

Given that we don't know the exact value of `x` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `x` must be one of the remaining keys in `cnt.values()` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated `ans` and the new value of `x` (which is one of the remaining keys in `cnt.values()`).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is increased by the next value of `x // 3` where `x` is one of the remaining keys in `cnt.values()`**.
