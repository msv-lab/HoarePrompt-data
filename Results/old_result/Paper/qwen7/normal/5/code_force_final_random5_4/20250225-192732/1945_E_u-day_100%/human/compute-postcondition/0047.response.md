Based on the initial state provided:

- `low` is either 0 or one of the previously calculated `mid` values.
- `high` is either `n` or one of the previously calculated `mid` values.
- `mid` is the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration.
- `pos` is 3.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call.
- `i` is `n`.
- `st` is a set containing all the unique `mid` values calculated during the loop iterations.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

The `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement will print two values:
1. `low + 1`: This is the value of `low` incremented by 1.
2. `pos + 1`: Since `pos` is 3, `pos + 1` will be 4.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **low + 1, 4**
