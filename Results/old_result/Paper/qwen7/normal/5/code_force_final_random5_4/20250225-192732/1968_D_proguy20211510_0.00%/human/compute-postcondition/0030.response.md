Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` is a list with one element \((k - (0 + 1)) * maxa\)**.

Explanation: The code appends the value \((k - (i + 1)) * maxa\) to the list `b`. Initially, `i` is 0, so the expression simplifies to \((k - 1) * maxa\). After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables (`k`, `foundb`, `founds`) remain unchanged. The list `b` now contains one element, which is \((k - 1) * maxa\).
