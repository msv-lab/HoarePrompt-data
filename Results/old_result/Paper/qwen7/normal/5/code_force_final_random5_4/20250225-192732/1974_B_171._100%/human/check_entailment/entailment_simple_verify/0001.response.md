### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the steps to ensure the reasoning is sound:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts. This is correct and efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters and Sorting**:
     - The program correctly identifies all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically. This is crucial for creating the symmetric mapping.
   - **Mapping Characters**:
     - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character is paired with its symmetric counterpart. This is done correctly by iterating through the sorted list of unique characters and mapping each character to its corresponding character from the end of the list.
   - **Decoding Process**:
     - The program uses the `char_map` to decode the entire encoded string by replacing each character with its mapped symmetric counterpart. This is done using a list comprehension, which is efficient and correct.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program processes each test case individually, calling the `func_1` function with the encoded string and appending the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the decoded strings. This is correct and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations provided, the program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.
