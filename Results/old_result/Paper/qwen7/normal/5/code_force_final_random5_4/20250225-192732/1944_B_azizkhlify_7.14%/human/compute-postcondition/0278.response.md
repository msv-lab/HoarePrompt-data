To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`. However, based on the problem description, the loop body should be modifying the list `r` according to the indices specified by `a[i]` for `i` ranging from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

3. **Determine the Final State Requirements**: 
   - The final state requires that `i` is `2 * n` after the loop executes all its iterations.
   - Each element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` has been incremented by 1 for every `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the Initial States**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`, the initial value of `i` should be `0`.
   - The value of `n` must be a positive integer.

Given these points, the initial state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute correctly and achieve the desired final state.

**State:**
- `i` is `0`
- `n` is a positive integer

So, the final answer is:
**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
