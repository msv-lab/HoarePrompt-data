Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over `test_cases`.
   - The only variable in the loop head is `test_case`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since `test_case` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to adjust its state.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is set to `n-1`, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is either `True` or `False`, `row2[j]` is `'>', `results` is either `['YES']` or `['NO']`, and `t` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `test_case` must be the next element in `test_cases`.
   - The other variables (`j`, `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `row2[j]`, `results`, and `t`) should remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is `n-1`, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is either `True` or `False`, `row2[j]` is `'>', `results` is either `['YES']` or `['NO']`, and `t` remains unchanged, `test_case` is the next element in `test_cases`**
