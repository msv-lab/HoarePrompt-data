Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`.**

The code `arr = input()` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `results`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
