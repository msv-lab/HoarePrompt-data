Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B'. If `inpstr[-i - 1]` (which is `inpstr[-1]` since `i` is 1) is 'B', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `inpstr[-1]` is not 'B', the condition remains unchanged.
