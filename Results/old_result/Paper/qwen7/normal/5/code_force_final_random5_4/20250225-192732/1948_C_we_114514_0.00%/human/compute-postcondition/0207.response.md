Postcondition: `j` is an integer starting from 0, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `row2[0]` is '>', otherwise it remains `False`. If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j]` equals '>', then `reachable_second_row` remains `True`; otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains `False`.
