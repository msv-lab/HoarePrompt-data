Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 3.
   - `n` must be at least 4 because the loop runs from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, and `i` reaches 3, meaning `2 * n - 1` must be at least 3, hence `n` must be at least 4.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`.
   - Given `i` starts at 3, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to run correctly.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `2 * n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, `i` will take values from 3 to `2 * n - 1`.
   - The loop will terminate when `i` reaches `2 * n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 to ensure the loop runs as expected.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
