Output State: **`index` is 2, `T` is an integer from the list `data` at position `index`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the new empty list `results` added to the existing conditions.
