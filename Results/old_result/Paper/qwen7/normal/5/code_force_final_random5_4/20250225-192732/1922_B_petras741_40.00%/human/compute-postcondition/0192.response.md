Postcondition: `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer less than 3, `w` is a list of integers from another input split by spaces, `eta_ln` is 3, `j` is `n`, `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 0, `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, `w` is updated to a list of integers from the new input split by spaces.
