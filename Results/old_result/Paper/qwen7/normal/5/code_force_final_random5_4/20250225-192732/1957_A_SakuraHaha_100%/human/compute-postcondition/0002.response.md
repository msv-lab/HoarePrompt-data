Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 100.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No changes are made to `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
