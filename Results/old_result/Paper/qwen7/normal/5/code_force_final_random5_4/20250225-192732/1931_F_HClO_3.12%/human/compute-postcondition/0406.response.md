Postcondition: `idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `idx2`, and `l` is `l1`. Otherwise, `m` is decreased by 1, and `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, `l3` remain unchanged.
