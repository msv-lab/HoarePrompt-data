Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `s` into two integers using `split()` and `map(int, ...)`. The first integer is assigned to `n` and the second integer is assigned to `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
