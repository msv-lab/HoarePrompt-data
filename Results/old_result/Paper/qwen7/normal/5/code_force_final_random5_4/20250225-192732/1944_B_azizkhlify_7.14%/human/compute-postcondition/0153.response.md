Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 6.
- `n` must be greater than 6.
- `a[6]` has been accessed to get an index, but no specific value is given for `a[6]`.
- The value at index `l[a[6] - 1]` is equal to 2.

Given this information, we need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

Since `i` is 6, `a[i]` refers to `a[6]`. However, the value of `a[6]` is not explicitly given. The only information we have is that the value at `l[a[6] - 1]` is 2. This does not directly help us determine the value of `a[6]`, but it confirms that `a[6] - 1` is a valid index in the list `l` that results in the value 2.

Since the problem does not provide the value of `a[6]`, we cannot determine the exact value to print. However, the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[6]` twice, separated by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **[a[6]] [a[6]] (where [a[6]] is the value of a[6])**
