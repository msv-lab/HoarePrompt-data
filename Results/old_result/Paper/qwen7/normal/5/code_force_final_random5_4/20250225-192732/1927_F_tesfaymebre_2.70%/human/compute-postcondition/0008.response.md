Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. This is because the loop continues as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0, and there is no operation within the loop that changes the value of `test_cases`. Therefore, if the loop runs for all its iterations without `test_cases` becoming less than or equal to 0, it means `test_cases` remains greater than 0 at the end.
