Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, `res` remains unchanged, `total_count` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers (excluding the first element), and `x` is the second element in the updated `num_list`.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. The other variables (`res`, `total_count`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation.
