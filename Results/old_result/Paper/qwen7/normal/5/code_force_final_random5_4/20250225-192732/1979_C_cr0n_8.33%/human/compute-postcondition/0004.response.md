Output State: **`prod` is `prod * r`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The variable `prod` is updated by multiplying its current value by `r`. The other variables (`t`, `N`, and `vals`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
