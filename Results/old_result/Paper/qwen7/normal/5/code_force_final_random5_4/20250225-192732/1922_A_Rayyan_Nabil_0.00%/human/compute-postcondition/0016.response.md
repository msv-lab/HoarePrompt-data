Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES'.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**.
