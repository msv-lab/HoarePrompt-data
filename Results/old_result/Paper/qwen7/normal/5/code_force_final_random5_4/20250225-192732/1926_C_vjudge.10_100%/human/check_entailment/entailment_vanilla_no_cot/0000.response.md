Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it attempts to precompute the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and store them in an array `values`. This approach is inefficient and unnecessary. Instead, we can directly compute the sum of digit sums for each number in the test cases without precomputing everything.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys

    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    nums = list(map(int, data[1:]))

    def sum_of_digit_sums(n):
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total_sum += sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        return total_sum

    for n in nums:
        print(sum_of_digit_sums(n))

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read` to handle large inputs efficiently.
2. **Parsing Data**: The input is split into the number of test cases `t` and the list of numbers `nums`.
3. **Function to Compute Sum of Digit Sums**: A function `sum_of_digit_sums(n)` is defined to compute the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `n`.
4. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each number in `nums`, the function `sum_of_digit_sums` is called, and the result is printed.

This approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct.
