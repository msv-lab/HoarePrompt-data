To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is -1, indicating the end of the loop.
   - `mex` is the minimum value obtained by iterating through the loop and updating `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`.
   - `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`.

2. **Operations**:
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` down to 0.
   - For each `i` in this range, `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]`.
   - After the loop, `mex` is the minimum value among all `p[i]`.

Given these points, let's assume a concrete example to understand the process better. Suppose `n = 3` and `a = [1, 2, 3]`. We'll go through the loop steps:

- Initially, `mex` is undefined.
- Loop starts with `i = 2`:
  - `p[2]` is updated to `mex - a[2]`.
  - Since `mex` is undefined, we need to initialize it. Let's assume `mex` starts as the maximum possible value, say `max_value`.
  - `p[2]` = `max_value - 3`.
- Loop continues with `i = 1`:
  - `p[1]` is updated to `mex - a[1]`.
  - `p[1]` = `max_value - 2`.
- Loop continues with `i = 0`:
  - `p[0]` is updated to `mex - a[0]`.
  - `p[0]` = `max_value - 1`.

After the loop, `mex` is the minimum value among `p[0]`, `p[1]`, and `p[2]`. In our example, `mex` would be `max_value - 3` because it is the smallest value among `max_value - 1`, `max_value - 2`, and `max_value - 3`.

Therefore, the list `p` after the loop would be `[max_value - 1, max_value - 2, max_value - 3]`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not specified, we can generalize the result as follows:

Output: **[mex - a[n-1], mex - a[n-2], ..., mex - a[0]]** where `mex` is the minimum value among all `p[i]` after the loop.
