Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the next element in `results`
- `results` must have at least one element remaining

The print statement `print(i)` will print the next element in the `results` list. Since `results` has at least one element remaining, `i` must be the current element being accessed.

Output: **the next element in results**
