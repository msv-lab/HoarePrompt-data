Output State: **`low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing the value `(0 + n) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to be the average of `low` and `high`. Since `low` is either 0 or `mid`, and `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, the new value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
