Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 31, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 1.
   - The postcondition includes a condition based on `cur >> 1 & 1`. Based on this condition, either `suf[0][1]` is set to 1 or `suf[0][0]` is set to 1.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = 31`.
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will run for 32 iterations (from 0 to 31).

4. **Current State**:
   - After the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - Therefore, the next iteration will increment `j` to 2.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `j`.
   - The other variables (`i`, `n`, `cur`, `suf`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

6. **Post-Iteration State**:
   - `i` remains 31.
   - `n` remains 32.
   - `cur` remains `prefix[31]`.
   - `j` is incremented to 2.
   - The postcondition based on `cur >> 1 & 1` will be evaluated again with `j` now being 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 31, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 2**
