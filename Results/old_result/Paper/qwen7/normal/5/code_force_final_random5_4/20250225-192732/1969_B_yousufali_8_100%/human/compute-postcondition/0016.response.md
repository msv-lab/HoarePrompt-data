Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is 3, `ans` is 6 (if `s[1]` is '0'), `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Initially, `n` was 2, so after executing the code, `n` becomes 3. The values of `s`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
