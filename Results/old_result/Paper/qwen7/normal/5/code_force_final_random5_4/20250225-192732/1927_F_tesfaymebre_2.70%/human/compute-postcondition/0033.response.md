Output State: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the final path of vertices being explored, which includes all vertices that were part of the path during the entire execution of the loop, `res` is a set containing the elements of the original `res` list, and `set_res` is the set created from `res`. If any neighbor `nei` of the current vertex `curr` was not colored 2, not equal to `parent`, and `node_v` was in `set_res` when `res` was not empty, the function would have returned a set containing the elements of the original `res` list. Since the loop has executed all its iterations without returning, the function will return None.
