Output State: **`a` must be at least 3, `i` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `b[i + 1]` by subtracting `2 * b[i]` from its current value. Given that `i` is 0 initially, `b[i + 1]` refers to `b[1]`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation. Therefore, `a` must still be at least 3, and `i` remains 0. The value of `b[1]` is now `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`.
