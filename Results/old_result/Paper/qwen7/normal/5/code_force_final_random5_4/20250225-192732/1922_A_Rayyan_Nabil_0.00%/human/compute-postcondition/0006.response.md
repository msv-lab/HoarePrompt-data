Output State: **`a` is a string input from the user, `n` is an input integer, `b` is a new string input from the user, `c` is a string input from the user**.

The code `c = input()` assigns the value of the next input from the user to the variable `c`. The values of `a`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
