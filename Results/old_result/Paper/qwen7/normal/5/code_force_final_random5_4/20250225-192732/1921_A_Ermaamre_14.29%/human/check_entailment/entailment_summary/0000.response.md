Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic in the program only considers the vertical distances between pairs of points, which is insufficient for determining the side length of the square. The program fails to account for the horizontal distances and to properly identify the side length of the square.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the side length of the square by finding the maximum difference in both the x-coordinates and y-coordinates among the given points. The side length of the square will be the maximum of these differences.

Here's how the corrected program should look:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        (x1, y1) = map(int, input().split())
        (x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
        (x3, y3) = map(int, input().split())
        (x4, y4) = map(int, input().split())

        # Calculate the differences in x and y coordinates
        x_diffs = [abs(x1 - x2), abs(x1 - x3), abs(x1 - x4), abs(x2 - x3), abs(x2 - x4), abs(x3 - x4)]
        y_diffs = [abs(y1 - y2), abs(y1 - y3), abs(y1 - y4), abs(y2 - y3), abs(y2 - y4), abs(y3 - y4)]

        # Find the maximum difference in x and y coordinates
        side_length = max(max(x_diffs), max(y_diffs))

        # Print the area of the square
        print(side_length ** 2)

func()
```

Given this analysis, the original program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the side length of the square.

Correctness: **False**
