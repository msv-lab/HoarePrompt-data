Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1**.

Explanation: The code assigns `-1` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. No other variables are affected, and the conditions related to `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `idx1` and `idx2`, and retains the initial conditions regarding `l11` and `l22`.
