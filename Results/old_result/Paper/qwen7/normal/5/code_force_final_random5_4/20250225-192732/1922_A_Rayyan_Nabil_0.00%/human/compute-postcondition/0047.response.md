Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts when `i` is `n-1`, the loop will run exactly once if `n` is at least 1 (because `i` will decrement to `n-2`, then `n-3`, and so on, until `i` becomes less than `n`).
   - Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute at least once. This means `n` must be greater than 0.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be `n-1` at the start of the loop.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

So, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `t` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is 'NO', `b` is an input from the user, `c` is an input from the user**
