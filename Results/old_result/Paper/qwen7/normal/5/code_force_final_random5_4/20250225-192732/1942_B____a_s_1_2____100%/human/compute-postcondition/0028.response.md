Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is -1; `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[-1]`; `p[-1]` is `mex - a[-1]`**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, where `i` is -1. Since `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`, substituting `i` with -1 gives us `p[-1]` is `mex - a[-1]`. Therefore, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `mex - a[-1]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
