Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `5 + n`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `array` is now updated to `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `results` is a list with an additional element `result`; `t` is greater than 0; `array` is now a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `array` to be a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from the position `index` and having a length of `n`.
- All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their conditions or values, except that `array` is now defined as specified.
