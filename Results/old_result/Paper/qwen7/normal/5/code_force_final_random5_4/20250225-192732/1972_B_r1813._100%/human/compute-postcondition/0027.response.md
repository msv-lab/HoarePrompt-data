Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0] - 2`, `count_u` is the number of 'U' in string `s`, `n` is now `int(data[index + 2])`, `s` is now `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 6.**

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Initially, `index` was increased by 4, so now it is increased by a total of 6. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
