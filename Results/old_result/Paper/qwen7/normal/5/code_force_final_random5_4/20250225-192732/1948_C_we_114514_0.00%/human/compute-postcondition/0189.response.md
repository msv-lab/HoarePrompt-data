Postcondition: `j` is `n - 1` or `j + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`.

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and the if part does not change the values of `j`, `n`, `reachable_first_row`, and `reachable_second_row`, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
