Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `k` is a string, `pb` is a string, `ps` is a string**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into four parts and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. Since the initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `n` retains this property. The values of `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are strings as they are obtained from splitting the input string.
