Output: **no**

Explanation: According to the initial state, the loop will execute `m-2` times, and after the loop completes, an input is taken but not assigned to any variable. The value of `m` must be greater than 3. The print statement simply outputs the string 'no', which does not depend on any variables or the value of `m`. Therefore, the output will be 'no'.
