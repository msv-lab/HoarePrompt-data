Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from stdin.**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 1, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 2. The values of `t` and `data` remain unchanged.
