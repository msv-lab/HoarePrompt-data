Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `t` must be at least 3, `start` is `start` - 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 3, `s` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input by the user to the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
