You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 1, `i` is 4, `m` must be greater than 3, `x` is -20, `y` is 16.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues until `i` reaches `m`. From the given information, we can see that after the third iteration, `i` is 3 and `m` must be greater than 3. Since `i` increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 4. However, the value of `cnt` does not change from the third iteration because the condition `i > 1` is still true but the term `x // y` results in a negative or zero value, which does not contribute to increasing `cnt`. Therefore, `cnt` remains at 1. The values of `x` and `y` continue to decrease as per the formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, respectively. For `i = 4`, `x` becomes `-20` and `y` becomes `16`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is 1, `i` is 4, `m` must be greater than 3, `x` is -20, `y` is 16, `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, n and m, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. The function returns 1 in both cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns 1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
