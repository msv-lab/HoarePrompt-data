Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `s` is a new string input by the user.
   - `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the conditions given, if `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, or if '11' is not found in `s`, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`.

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1` under the given conditions, these variables remain the same for the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only thing that changes is the value of `t` as it gets decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

6. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` will be `t - 1` (decremented by 1).
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `cnt1` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is a new input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`**.
