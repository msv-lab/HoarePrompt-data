Output State: **`ptsb` now contains the new element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `ptss` now contains the new elements `pres[i+1] + rem * s[i+1]` and `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`. The new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. The values of `ptsb` and `rem` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated state includes the new element in `ptss`.
