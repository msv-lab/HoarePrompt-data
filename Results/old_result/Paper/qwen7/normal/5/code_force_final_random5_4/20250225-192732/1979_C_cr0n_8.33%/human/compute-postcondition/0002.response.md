Output State: **`prod` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, and the list `k` is unchanged; `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `prod` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, the list `k`, or the list `vals`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. `prod` is explicitly set to 1.
