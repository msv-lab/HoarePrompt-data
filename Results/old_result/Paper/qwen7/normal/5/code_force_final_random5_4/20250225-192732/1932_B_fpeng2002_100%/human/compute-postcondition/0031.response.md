Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is equal to the length of `nums`, `start_year` is the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[i] + 1) * nums[i]` for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements `num_tests` by 1. All other variables (`n`, `nums`, `x`, and `start_year`) remain unchanged from their initial state. `num_tests` is now one less than its original value, but it is still greater than 0 since it was initially greater than 0.
