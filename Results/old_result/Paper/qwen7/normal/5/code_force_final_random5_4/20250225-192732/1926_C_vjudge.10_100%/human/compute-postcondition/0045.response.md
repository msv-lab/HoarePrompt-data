Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 200001, meaning `t` is an integer with a minimum value of 200001.
- `value` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided.

The print statement is `print(values[value])`.

Since the value of `values` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact content of `values`. However, we know that `values` is a sequence (likely a list or dictionary) from which we need to access an element using the index `value`.

Given that `value` is an integer, the print statement will attempt to print the element at the index `value` in the `values` sequence.

Output: **values[value] (where value is the input integer used as the index to access the `values` sequence)**
