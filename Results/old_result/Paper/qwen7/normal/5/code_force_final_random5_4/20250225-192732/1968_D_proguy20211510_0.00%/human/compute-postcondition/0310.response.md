Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer converted from the original `n`, `k` is an integer converted from the original `k`, `pb` is an integer converted from the original `pb`, `ps` is an integer converted from the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input using `input().split()`, and then converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `p`. The values of `maxs`, `maxb`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged from their initial state.
