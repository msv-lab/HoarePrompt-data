Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it only considers the first and last positions of black cells ('B') without ensuring that all segments between black cells are also considered. The program calculates the distance between the first and last black cells but does not guarantee that all segments between these black cells are painted, which might require painting longer segments to turn all cells white.

To correctly solve the problem, you should find the longest sequence of consecutive white cells ('W') and then calculate the minimum segment length needed to cover any remaining black cells ('B').
