Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 2, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a` + `f`, `m` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, `m`) remain unchanged.
