Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is typically an underscore indicating that the value of the loop variable is not used within the loop body. However, for the purpose of adjusting the initial state, we need to focus on the other variables involved in the loop condition and the loop body logic.
   - The loop condition is `range(m - 2)`, which means the loop will run from 0 to `m-3` (inclusive).
   - The variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, `a2`, `l2`, `a3`, `l3`, and `m` are relevant for determining the initial state.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 2 because the loop runs `m - 2` times.
   - The loop body updates `idx1` and `idx2` and modifies `l2` and `val` based on these indices.
   - The loop body also checks if `idx1` is less than `idx2` to update `l2` and `val`, and if `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, it may update `val` and decrease `m`.

3. **Adjust the Initial State:**
   - Since the loop will run `m - 2` times, `m` must be at least 3.
   - The values of `idx1` and `idx2` will be updated within the loop, but their initial values must be such that the loop can proceed without immediate failure.
   - `val` can be an empty list or a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`. The exact value of `val` is not critical for the loop to execute, but it should be consistent with the logic inside the loop.

Given this analysis, the key states that need to be adjusted are `m` and the initial values of `idx1` and `idx2` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `m` must be greater than 2.
- `idx1` and `idx2` can be any valid initial values that allow the loop to proceed.

Since the exact values of `idx1` and `idx2` are not specified and can vary, we focus on ensuring `m` is sufficient for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` must be greater than 2**
