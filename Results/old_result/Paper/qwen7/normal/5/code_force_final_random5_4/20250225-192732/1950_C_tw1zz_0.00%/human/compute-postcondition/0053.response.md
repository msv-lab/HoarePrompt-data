Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is '09', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is '09', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `h1 = '09'` assigns the string `'09'` to the variable `h1`. The value of `h` remains unchanged as `'09'`, and the other variables (`t`, `m`, `m1`, `time`) retain their initial states.
