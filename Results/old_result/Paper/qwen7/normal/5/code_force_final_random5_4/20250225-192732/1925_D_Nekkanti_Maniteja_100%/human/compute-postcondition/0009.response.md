Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `i` is 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a` + `f`, `m` must be greater than 0, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split.**

The value of `a` is incremented by `f`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
