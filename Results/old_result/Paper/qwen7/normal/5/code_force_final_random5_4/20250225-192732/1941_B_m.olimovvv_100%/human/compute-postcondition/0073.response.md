Output State: **`a` must be at least 3, `i` is 0, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `0`**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, which results in `b[i]` becoming 0. Since `i` is 0, `b[i]` is `b[0]`. Therefore, `b[0]` is set to 0. The value of `a` and the condition that it must be at least 3 remain unchanged. The value of `b[i + 2]` (which is `b[2]`) is decreased by `b[i]` (which is now 0), so `b[2]` is also unchanged.
