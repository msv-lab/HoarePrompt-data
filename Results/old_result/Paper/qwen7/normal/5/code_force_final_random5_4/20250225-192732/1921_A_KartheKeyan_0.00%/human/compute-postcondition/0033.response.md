Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[('4', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer')]`, `p2` is 0, `res` is 0, `n` is 1**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning the first to `x` and the second to `y`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, and the list `coord` is updated with the new values of `x` and `y`. The variables `p2`, `res`, and `n` remain unchanged.
