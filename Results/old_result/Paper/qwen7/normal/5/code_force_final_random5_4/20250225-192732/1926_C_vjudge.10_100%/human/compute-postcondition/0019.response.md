Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in str(i):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. The variable `x` takes the value of each character in the string `i` one by one.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sum_value_digits` is the original value plus twice the integer value of the first character of the previous `i`.
   - `i` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than the previous iteration).

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is one character shorter than the previous iteration, it means that the loop has processed one character from `i`.
   - Therefore, `i` now contains all characters of the previous `i` except the first one.
   - The variable `sum_value_digits` remains unchanged as the loop body is omitted, meaning no additional operations are performed on `sum_value_digits`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which now contains a string one character shorter than the previous iteration.
   - `sum_value_digits` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**`sum_value_digits` is the original value plus twice the integer value of the first character of the previous `i`, `i` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than the previous iteration)**.

State: **`sum_value_digits` is the original value plus twice the integer value of the first character of the previous `i`, `i` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than the previous iteration)**
