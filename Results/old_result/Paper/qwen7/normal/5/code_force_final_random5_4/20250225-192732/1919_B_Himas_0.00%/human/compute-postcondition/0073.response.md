Output State: The input string `e` must be non-empty, `P` will be the total count of '+' characters in `e`, `M` will be the total count of '-' characters in `e`, `i` is `len(e) + 1`, `q` is the last character of `e`, and `s` is an input integer that remains unchanged.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `e` must still be a non-empty string. The variable `P` will hold the total number of '+' characters found in `e`, while `M` will hold the total number of '-' characters found in `e`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is equal to the length of `e` plus one. The variable `q` is the last character of `e`, and `s` remains as the input integer it was initialized with.
