Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `t`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < t`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split.
   - `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, no changes are made to `k`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `t - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `t - 1 + 1 = t`.
   - The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged because the loop has not yet modified it.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `t` must still be at least 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same (either unchanged or less than `n - 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, and if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then no changes are made to `k`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**
