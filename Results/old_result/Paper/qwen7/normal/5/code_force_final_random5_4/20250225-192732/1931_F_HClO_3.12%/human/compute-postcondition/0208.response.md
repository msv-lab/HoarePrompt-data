Output State: **`idx1` is equal to `i`, `idx2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code, the only effect is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the `break` statement.
