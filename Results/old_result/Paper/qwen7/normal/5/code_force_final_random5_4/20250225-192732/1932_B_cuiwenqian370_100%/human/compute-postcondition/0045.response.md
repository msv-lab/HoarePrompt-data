Output State: **`i` is 3, `last_year` is 4, `results` is ['4'], `index` is increased by 1, `a` is [3]**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` attempts to convert elements in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into integers and store them in a list `a`. However, the initial state does not provide the exact value of `data`, `index`, or `n`. Given that `index` is increased by 1, we know `index` now points to the next element. Since `results` is `['4']` and `i` is 3, we can infer that `data` might be something like `[3, '4']` (assuming `index` was pointing to `'4'` before increment). Thus, `a` would be `[3]` after converting the first element in the slice to an integer.
