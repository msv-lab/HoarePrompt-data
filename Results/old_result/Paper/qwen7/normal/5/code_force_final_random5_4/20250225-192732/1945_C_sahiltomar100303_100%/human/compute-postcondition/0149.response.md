Postcondition: `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 8, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `n`, and `left` is equal to 0, regardless of whether `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`.
