Output State: `s` is an input string, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for every occurrence of '0' in `s' followed by a final increment of `n` if `s` contains any '1's.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `s` retains its original input string value. The variable `n` will hold the total length of the string `s`. The variable `ans` will be the count of '0's in the string plus one for each '0', plus an additional increment of `n` if there is at least one '1' in the string.
