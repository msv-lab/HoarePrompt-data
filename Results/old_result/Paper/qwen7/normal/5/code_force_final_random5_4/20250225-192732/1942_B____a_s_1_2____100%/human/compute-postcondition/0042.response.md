Output State: **`p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, `n` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
