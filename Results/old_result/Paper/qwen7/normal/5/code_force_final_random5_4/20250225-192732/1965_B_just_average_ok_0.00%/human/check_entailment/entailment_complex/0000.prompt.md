Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute for each test case provided by the user. After all iterations, `num_tests` will be the total number of test cases processed, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000. For each test case, `n` will be the integer obtained from the first input split, and `k` will be an integer within the range 2 <= k <= n. The variable `nums` will be a list containing specific integers based on the value of `k` for each test case. Specifically, `nums` will include the powers of 2 up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, plus three additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. After removing the largest power of 2 from the list, `nums` will contain exactly 25 elements. The variable `idx` will be set to the index of the largest power of 2 removed from the list, which will vary depending on the value of `k`.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop, the output state will reflect the processing of all test cases, with `num_tests` indicating the total number of cases, `n` and `k` representing the parameters for each case, and `nums` being the final list of 25 integers for each case as described above.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n and k. For each test case, it generates a list `nums` containing 25 specific integers based on the value of k. The list includes powers of 2 up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to k, plus three additional elements derived from k. After processing all test cases, it prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums` for each case.
