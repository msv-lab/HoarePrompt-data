Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a list of characters with at least one character.
   - `thorn` is 2 if `i` equals '*', and `thorn` is 0 if `i` does not equal '*'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the list `s`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `s`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
   - `s` will be the remaining list after removing the current character `i`.
   - `thorn` will be updated based on whether `i` is '*' or not.

Given these points, let's determine the new state:

- `s` will have one fewer character than it did at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` will be the next character in `s`.
- `thorn` will be 2 if `i` is '*', and 0 otherwise.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character (one fewer than before), `i` is the next character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is 2 if `i` equals '*', and `thorn` is 0 if `i` does not equal '*'**.

To express this concisely:

**State: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character (one fewer than before), `i` is the next character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is 2 if `i` equals '*', and `thorn` is 0 if `i` does not equal '*'**.
