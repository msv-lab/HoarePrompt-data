Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is not correct because it does not correctly handle the problem constraints. The function `func_1` calculates the number of regular polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3, which is incorrect. This approach assumes that every set of three sticks of the same length can form a triangle, but it does not consider the possibility of forming other types of polygons (e.g., squares, pentagons, etc.).

To solve this problem correctly, you need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all stick lengths to determine the largest possible side length of a regular polygon that can be formed. Then, count how many sets of sides of that length can be formed from the sticks.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each stick length
    freq = Counter(arr)
    
    # Find the GCD of all stick lengths
    gcd_value = arr[0]
    for length in arr[1:]:
        gcd_value = math.gcd(gcd_value, length)
    
    # Calculate the number of complete polygons that can be formed
    num_polygons = min(freq[length] // gcd_value for length in freq.keys())
    print(num_polygons)
```

This corrected program first counts the frequency of each stick length using `Counter`. It then calculates the GCD of all stick lengths to determine the largest possible side length of a regular polygon. Finally, it calculates the number of complete polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by the GCD value and taking the minimum of these values.
