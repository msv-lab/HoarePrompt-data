Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `n-1`, `l` is 'NO', `c` is the input from the user.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `n`. The condition inside the `if` statement checks if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If this condition is never met for any `i` in the range of `n`, the value of `l` remains `'YES'` due to the `else` statement setting `l` to `'NO'`. Since we know from the given conditions that the loop executed at least 3 times and `l` was set to `'YES'` initially, if `l` is not changed to `'NO'` during any iteration, it will remain `'YES'` after the loop. However, if the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is never met for any `i` in the range of `n`, `l` will be set to `'NO'` after the loop completes all iterations. Given the information provided, the final state of `l` will be `'NO'` if the condition is never met, and the other variables (`i`, `n`, `t`, and `c`) will retain their final values as described.
