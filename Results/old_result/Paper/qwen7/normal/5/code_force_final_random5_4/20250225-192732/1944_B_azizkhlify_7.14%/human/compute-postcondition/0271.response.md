Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be a positive integer, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` and `r`, only that `i` is equal to `n` and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the only change is that `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
