Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `index` is `8 + n + n`
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `results` is a list with two additional elements which are `result`
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index:index + n])`
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `t`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `index` remains the same: `8 + n + n`
- `t` is now `t - 1`, which means `t` is still greater than 0 but decreased by 1.
- `results` remains the same: a list with two additional elements which are `result`
- `arr` remains the same: a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index:index + n])`
- `result` remains the same: the return value of `func_1(arr)`

So, the updated state is:
State: **`index` is 8 + n + n, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**
