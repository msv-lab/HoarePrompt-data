Output State: **`s` is `x + (n + 1) // 2`, `n` is `n // 2 // 2`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is twice its original value.**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` multiplies the current value of `m` by 2. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `m`, we only know that `m` is now twice its original value. The values of `s`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
