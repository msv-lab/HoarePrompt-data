### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, and then reads the edges along with their weights.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`) and a list of edges (`edges`).
   - Edges are stored as tuples `(weight, u, v)`.

3. **Sorting Edges**:
   - The edges are sorted in reverse order based on their weights. This is done to process the heaviest edges first, which helps in finding cycles more efficiently.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to keep track of connected components and the minimum edge weight within each component.
   - The DSU is initialized with `n + 1` elements (to handle 1-based indexing).

5. **Finding Minimum Weight Cycle**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected (`parent_u == parent_v`), the program updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle.
   - If no cycle is detected, the DSU is updated with the new edge.

6. **Cycle Detection Using DFS**:
   - After identifying the minimum weight edge in a cycle, the program uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the cycle involving the identified nodes.
   - The DFS function marks visited nodes and returns the path of the cycle.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Graph Representation and Edge Sorting**:
   - The graph representation and edge sorting steps are correct and necessary for efficient cycle detection.

2. **DSU Implementation**:
   - The DSU implementation is correct for detecting cycles and maintaining the minimum edge weight within each component.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The approach of using DSU to detect cycles and then using DFS to find the exact cycle is sound and should work correctly for the given constraints.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Key Points to Validate

- **DSU Initialization**: The DSU is correctly initialized with `n + 1` elements.
- **Cycle Detection**: The DSU is used correctly to detect cycles and update the minimum edge weight.
- **DFS Traversal**: The DFS function correctly identifies the cycle and returns the path.

### Detailed Validation

1. **DSU Initialization**:
   - The DSU is correctly initialized with `n + 1` elements, ensuring that all nodes are properly indexed.

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - During the iteration over the sorted edges, the DSU is used to check if adding an edge creates a cycle.
   - If a cycle is detected, the minimum edge weight is updated, and the nodes involved in the cycle are recorded.

3. **DFS Traversal**:
   - The DFS function correctly identifies the cycle and returns the path of vertices.
   - The path is constructed by marking visited nodes and backtracking to find the cycle.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed validation and the original assessment, the given program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
