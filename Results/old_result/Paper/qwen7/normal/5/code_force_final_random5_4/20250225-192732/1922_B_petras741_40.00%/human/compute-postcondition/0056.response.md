Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `eta[j]` remains unchanged, `q` remains unchanged, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`, and `j` is `eta_ln`.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its current value. The value of `eta[j]` remains unchanged, `q` remains unchanged, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`. The variable `j` is still `eta_ln`.
