Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, still being an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The precondition that the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5 is still valid but not directly impacted by this line of code.
