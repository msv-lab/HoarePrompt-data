Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variables involved here are `t` (which determines the number of iterations) and the loop variable `_`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `data[0]` must be a positive integer.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `index` is increased by `1 + n`.
   - `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`.
   - `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, the only thing that changes is the value of `t` itself. If `t` was greater than 1 initially, it will now be decreased by 1 because one iteration has completed.
   - The other variables (`n`, `index`, `array`, `result`, `results`) are not directly affected by the loop control variable `t` and their values are derived from the loop body, which is omitted in this context.

Given these points, the state adjustment for the next iteration would involve decreasing `t` by 1.

**State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `index` is increased by `1 + n`; `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`; `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is decreased by 1**
