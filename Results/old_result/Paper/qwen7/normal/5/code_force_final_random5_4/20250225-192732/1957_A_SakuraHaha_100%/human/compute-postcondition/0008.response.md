Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `x` which iterates over the list `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. For each iteration, the variable `x` takes the value of the current element in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of `n-1` integers, each between 1 and 100.
   - `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`.
   - The count of the integer `x` (which was the value of `x` in the previous iteration) has been increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the current element being processed in the list `a`, for the next iteration, `x` will take the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` remains the same, but the dictionary `cnt` will now have the count of the new `x` (the next element in `a`) incremented by 1.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The list `a` remains unchanged.
   - The dictionary `cnt` will now include the count of the next element in `a` incremented by 1.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a list of `n-1` integers each between 1 and 100, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, with the count of the integer `x` (the next element in the list `a`) increased by 1**.
