Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` is an input integer greater than 99, `s` is a string consisting of 95 'รป' characters, `j` is 291, `n` is an input integer.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t`, which means the loop has run `t` times. Given the constraints, `t` can be any value between 3 and 676 inclusive. The variable `k` must be greater than 99 because the loop starts from 97 and increments by 1 until it reaches `k + 97`. Since the loop runs for each value of `k` up to `t`, `k` must be greater than 99 to ensure the loop completes all iterations. The string `s` will consist of 95 'รป' characters because the loop runs from 97 to `k + 97`, and when `k` is greater than 99, the loop runs 95 times. The variable `j` will be 291 at the end of the last iteration. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.
