Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`. If `cnt1` is not greater than 2 or not even, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`.**
