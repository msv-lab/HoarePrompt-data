Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code snippet only includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but it does not contain the complete logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the following key components are missing:

1. **Initialization of the Field and Entities**: The initial state of the field and the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and Bludgers need to be read and stored.

2. **Processing Actions**: The program needs to process each action step-by-step, updating the positions of players and the Quaffle, checking for eliminations, and scoring points.

3. **Output Events**: The program should output the events as specified, including scoring and eliminations, and finally print the final score.

4. **Player and Ball Tracking**: The logic to handle player movements, catching, throwing, and interactions with the Bludger is missing.

Here's a brief outline of what the complete solution should include:

- **Reading Input**: Read the dimensions of the field, the initial state of the field, and the number of steps.
- **Processing Steps**: For each step, update the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the actions.
- **Checking for Events**: Check if any player has scored a point or been eliminated.
- **Outputting Events**: Print the events as specified.
- **Final Score**: Print the final score at the end of the game.

The provided code only handles one part of the problem (checking for eliminations), but lacks the core logic for processing the game steps and handling the various events. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
