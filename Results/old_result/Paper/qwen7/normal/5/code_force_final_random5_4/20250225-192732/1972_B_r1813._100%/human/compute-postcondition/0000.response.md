Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", and we read the input from standard input.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` changes the way input is read from reading line by line to reading the entire input as a single string. However, the values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
