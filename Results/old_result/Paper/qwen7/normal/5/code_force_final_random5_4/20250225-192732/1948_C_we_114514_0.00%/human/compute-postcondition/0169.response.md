Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, the condition `reachable_first_row` is false, and the current value of `j` is less than `n - 1` with `row2[j]` equal to '>', `reachable_second_row` is True.**

The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
