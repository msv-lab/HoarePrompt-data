Postcondition: **`leftZero` is reduced by 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `left` is now `mid - 1`, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must hold true for the next iteration. Additionally, if `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1; otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.**
