The only objects in the loop head are variables `x`, `nums`, and `num_of_lens`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer, updated by incrementing the count of the integer `x` by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `x` needs to be set to the next element in the list `nums`. Since the list is non-empty, there will always be at least one element left to iterate over. After the current iteration, the count of the integer `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer, updated by incrementing the count of the integer `x` by 1, and `x` is the next element in the list `nums`**.
