Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `n-1`, `l` is 'YES', `c` is the input from the user, and the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]'.**

The code simply reassigns the variable `l` to the string `'YES'`. Since the initial state already had `l` as `'YES'`, this assignment does not change the value of `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
