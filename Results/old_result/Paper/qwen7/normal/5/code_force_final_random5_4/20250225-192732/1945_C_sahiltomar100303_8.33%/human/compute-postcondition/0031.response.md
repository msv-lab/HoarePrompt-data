Output State: **`i` is 2; `mid` must still be greater than 1; `leftZero` is increased by 1 (so `leftZero` is now 2)**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Since `leftZero` was increased by 1 in the initial state, it is now increased by another 1, making its new value 2. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
