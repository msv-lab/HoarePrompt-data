Postcondition: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `curr` appended to it, `res` is updated to the return value from the dfs function call for the neighbor `nei` of the current vertex `curr`, where `nei` is not colored 2, not equal to `parent`, and either `res` is empty or `nei` is not in `set_res`.
