Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0. Since the loop runs `test_cases` times, `test_cases` must be a positive integer.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that `test_cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\) after calling `func_1()`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. Given the constraints, this condition is already satisfied since `test_cases` is within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\).

5. **Final State**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `test_cases`, ensuring it is greater than 0. Since the initial state already satisfies this condition, no further adjustment is necessary.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**.
