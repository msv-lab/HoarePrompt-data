Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
3. The function `func_1` is defined to check if the password meets the criteria:
   - It separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter.
4. If any of these conditions fail, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.
5. The logic in the function correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
