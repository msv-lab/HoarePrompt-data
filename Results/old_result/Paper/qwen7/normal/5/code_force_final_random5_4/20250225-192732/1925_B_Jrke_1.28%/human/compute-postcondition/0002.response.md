Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the first split, `n` is an integer input from the second split, `k` is the floor division result of `x` by `n`.**

This means that `k` is calculated as the integer result of dividing `x` by `n` using floor division (`//`). The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
