The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and a binary string \( a \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the number of zeros and ones in the first half and second half of the string. It then determines and prints the position \( p \) (either left or right) that minimizes the absolute difference between the count of zeros and ones when considering the substring starting from the beginning up to position \( p \) or from position \( p \) to the end.
