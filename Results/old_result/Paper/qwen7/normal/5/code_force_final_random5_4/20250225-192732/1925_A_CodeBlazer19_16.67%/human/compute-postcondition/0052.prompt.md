You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = ''
        
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` is an input integer greater than 99, `s` is a string consisting of 95 'û' characters, `j` is 291, `n` is an input integer.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t`, which means the loop has run `t` times. Given the constraints, `t` can be any value between 3 and 676 inclusive. The variable `k` must be greater than 99 because the loop starts from 97 and increments by 1 until it reaches `k + 97`. Since the loop runs for each value of `k` up to `t`, `k` must be greater than 99 to ensure the loop completes all iterations. The string `s` will consist of 95 'û' characters because the loop runs from 97 to `k + 97`, and when `k` is greater than 99, the loop runs 95 times. The variable `j` will be 291 at the end of the last iteration. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes values for t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 676, and n and k are positive integers between 1 and 26. It returns a result based on these values.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
