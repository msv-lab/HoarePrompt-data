Output State: **`end` is 0, `start` is equal to `len(lst)` - 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. The other variables (`end`, `start`, `mini`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `start` is still equal to `len(lst) - 1`, and `mini` remains the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, assuming `start` is greater than 0.
