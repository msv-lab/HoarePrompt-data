You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each index `i`, `p[i]` equals `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p`. After constructing the permutation, it prints the elements of `p`. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the permutation `p` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic used to assign values to the permutation \( p \) is flawed. 

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  5
  1 1 -2 1 2
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  A valid permutation \( p \) such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

- **Given Program Output:**
  ```
  0 1 4 2 3
  ```

- **Verification:**
  - For \( i = 1 \): \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1 \)
  - For \( i = 2 \): \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1 \) (which is incorrect since \( a_2 \) should be 1)
  - For \( i = 3 \): \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = 2 - 4 = -2 \)
  - For \( i = 4 \): \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
  - For \( i = 5 \): \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 0 - 3 = -3 \) (which is incorrect since \( a_5 \) should be 2)

The program fails to correctly compute the MEX value for each prefix of the permutation, leading to incorrect values in the array \( a \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
