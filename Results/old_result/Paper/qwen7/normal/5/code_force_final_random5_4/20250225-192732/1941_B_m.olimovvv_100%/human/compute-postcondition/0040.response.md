Output State: **`b` is a list of integers; `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the element at index `i + 1` in the list `b` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i`. The initial conditions and other elements of the list remain unchanged.
