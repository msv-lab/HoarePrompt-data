Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d2` as a `defaultdict` with the default factory set to `int`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, or `d1`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `t`, `i`, and `d1` remain unchanged, and `d2` is now an additional `defaultdict` with the same default factory as `d1`.
