Reasoning:

1. The problem requires checking if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
2. The key insight is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, then it is always possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers.
3. The provided solution checks if the total amount of water (`total`) is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it returns 'NO'.
4. If the total is divisible by `n`, it calculates the mean amount of water per container (`mean`).
5. It then iterates through the list of water amounts, keeping a running difference (`curr`) between the current total and the target total (`n * mean`).
6. However, the check `if curr < 0:` is unnecessary and incorrect. This condition is only relevant if the initial distribution of water is not already even, but since the total amount is guaranteed to be divisible by `n`, this check is redundant.
7. Instead, the function should directly return 'YES' after confirming that the total is divisible by `n`, because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. Therefore, the water can always be distributed evenly without needing to iterate through the list and adjust the running difference.

Given the logic and the constraints, the provided code is overly complex and includes an unnecessary check. The correct and simplified version would directly return 'YES' after confirming the divisibility, as the problem guarantees that the sum is always divisible by `n`.

Final: **False**

Explanation: The original assessment incorrectly included an unnecessary and incorrect check in the code. The function should simply verify the divisibility of the total amount by the number of containers and return 'YES' if true, without the need for the running difference check.
