Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `M`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is not met since the assignment operation itself does not evaluate the condition `if num > cur + 1`. Therefore, the other preconditions remain valid.
