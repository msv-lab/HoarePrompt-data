Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `c` is an array of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^9\), `a` is an array of length `n+1` where `a[0]` is 0 and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sums of the integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is an array of length `n+1` where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n+1` is the sum of `x` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is `n+1`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` > 1 else 2.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(accumulate(a))` uses the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module to create a new array `a` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that point in the original array `a`. This means that `a[i]` will be the sum of `a[0]` to `a[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n+1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `b`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
