The function processes a permutation array `arr` of length `n` and an integer `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n). It first finds the position of `k` in the array. Then, it uses binary search to determine the smallest index `low` where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k`, or 0 if no such index exists. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints `1`, `low + 1`, and `pos + 1`, where `pos` is the initial position of `k` found earlier. The function does not return any value but modifies the output through print statements.
