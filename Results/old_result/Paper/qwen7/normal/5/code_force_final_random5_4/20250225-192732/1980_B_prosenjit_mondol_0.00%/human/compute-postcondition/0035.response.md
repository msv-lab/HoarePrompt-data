Output State: **`a` is a list of integers created from input split and converted to integers, `x` is the element at index `f-1` in list `a`, `n` is the integer from the first split, `f` is `f` decreased by 1, `k` is the integer from the first split decreased by 3, `x` is the element at index `f-1` in list `a`.**

The code `x = a[f]` assigns the value of the element at index `f-1` in list `a` to the variable `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
