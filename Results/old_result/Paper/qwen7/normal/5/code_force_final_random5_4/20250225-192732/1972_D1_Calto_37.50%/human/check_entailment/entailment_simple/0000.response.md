Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\). It works as expected, reducing \(a\) and \(b\) until \(b\) becomes 0, leaving \(a\) as the GCD of the original \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The logic in this function is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the formulas used to calculate \(x\) and \(y\) do not align with the problem statement requirements. The conditions involve checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the current implementation does not perform this check.

3. **Problem Statement**: The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided code does not implement this logic correctly.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation of `func_2` is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
