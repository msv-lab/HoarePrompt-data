Output State: **`k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `k`, `t1`, `t2`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation, their values remain the same. The only change is that `i` is increased by 1.
