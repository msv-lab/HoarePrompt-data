State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 1.
- The loop condition `1 <= i < n + 1` must hold true for the loop to execute. Since `i` starts at 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
