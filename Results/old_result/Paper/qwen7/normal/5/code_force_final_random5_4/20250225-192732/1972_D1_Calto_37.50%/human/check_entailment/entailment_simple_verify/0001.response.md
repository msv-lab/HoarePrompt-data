### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the annotated code against the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD is correct and efficient. This part is fine.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The annotated code incorrectly describes the behavior of the function. Specifically:
     - The expression \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) do not align with the problem requirements.
     - The loop does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - The logic inside the loop does not increment the count based on the correct condition.

3. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Issues Identified**:
   - The current implementation in `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic.
   - The function does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic inside the loop is incorrect and does not count valid pairs.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd = func_1(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)
```

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not solve the problem correctly. The annotated code further confirms this by showing incorrect logic and misinterpretation of the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
