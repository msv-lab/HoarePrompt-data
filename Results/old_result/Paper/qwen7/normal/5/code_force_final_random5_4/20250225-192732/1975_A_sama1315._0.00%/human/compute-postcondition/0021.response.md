Output State: **`index` is 8 + n + n, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.

This means that the value of `n` is now set to the integer value of `data[index]`, while all other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
