Output State: **`counter` is 1 if the last digit of `num` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 0; `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\); `i` is `len(num) - 2`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the innermost if statement. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the given code snippet, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
