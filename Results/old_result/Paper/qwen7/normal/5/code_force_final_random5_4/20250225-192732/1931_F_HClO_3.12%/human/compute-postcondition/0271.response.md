Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing a tuple (`a3`, `l3`) appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`. The original values of `m` and `val` remain unchanged, and `val` now contains a tuple of `a3` and `l3`.
