Output State: **After all iterations, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the concatenated list of `nums` from all iterations, each subtracted by its respective `last` value from the end of the corresponding `nums` list. If `curr` equals 0, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `curr` will hold the total sum of all non-zero elements from each `nums` list, adjusted by subtracting the last element of each `nums` list from the sum of its non-zero elements. If this final value of `curr` is 0, the output will be 'YES'; otherwise, it will be 'NO'.
