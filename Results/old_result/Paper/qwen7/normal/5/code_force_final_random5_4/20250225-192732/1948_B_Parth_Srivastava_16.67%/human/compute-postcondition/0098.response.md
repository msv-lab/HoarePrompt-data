Output State: **`i` is 5; `c` contains an element which is `a[5]`; `len(a)` must be greater than 5**

Explanation: The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to list `c`. Given that `i` is 5, `c` now contains the element `a[5]`. The initial condition that `len(a)` must be greater than 5 remains unchanged.
