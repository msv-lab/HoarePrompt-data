Output State: **`j` is 0; `s` is 'a'; `char_count[0]` is 'a'[0] + 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 0, `char_count[0]` is incremented by 1. Since `char_count[0]` was initially equal to `'a'[0]`, which is the character 'a', after incrementing by 1, `char_count[0]` becomes 'a'[0] + 1. The values of `j` and `s` remain unchanged.
