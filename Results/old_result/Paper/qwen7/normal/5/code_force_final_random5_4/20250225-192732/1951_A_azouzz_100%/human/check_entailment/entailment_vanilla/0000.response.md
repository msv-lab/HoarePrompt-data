### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem description is not explicitly provided in the given context. However, based on the code, it appears that the program is intended to:
   - Generate two files (`ac.py` and `wa.py`) for each `.html` file in subfolders of the current directory whose names are within a specified range.
   - The provided `func_1` function seems unrelated to the main functionality described above.

2. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is designed to create two new files (`ac.py` and `wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in subdirectories with names within a specified range.
   - The `func_1` function is defined but never called within the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function or any other part of the provided code.
   - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block calls `generate_files_for_html_in_range` with specific parameters (1951 and 1980).

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function correctly identifies subdirectories with names within the specified range and processes their `.html` files.
   - The logic for generating `ac.py` and `wa.py` files is correct.
   - The `func_1` function is not relevant to the main functionality and does not affect the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.

### Conclusion:
The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function performs its intended task correctly, and the presence of an unrelated function (`func_1`) does not impact the correctness of the main functionality.

**Correctness: True**
