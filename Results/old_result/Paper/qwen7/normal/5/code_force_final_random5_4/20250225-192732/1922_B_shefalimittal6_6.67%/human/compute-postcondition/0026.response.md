Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `cnt` from the `num_of_lens.values()`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are more values in `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: We need to adjust the state of `cnt` for the next iteration. Since `cnt` is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`, it will be the next value in the dictionary when the loop continues.

4. **Consider the postcondition**: The postcondition updates `res` based on the value of `cnt`. However, since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to consider the exact update to `res` for this step.

5. **Adjust the state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` was used from `num_of_lens.values()`. For the next iteration, `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `total_sum` remains unchanged because it is derived from `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the current `cnt`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`**.
