Output State: **`node_u` is `u`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight of the tree rooted at `parent_u`, `w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure, `node_v` is `v`.**

Explanation: The line `node_v = v` assigns the value of `v` to the variable `node_v`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `node_u`, `_min_edge`, `w`, `u`, `v`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain unchanged.
