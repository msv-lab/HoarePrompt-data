Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total_count` is `cnt`, where `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `res` is updated based on the value of `cnt`:
     - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is set to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
     - Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
   - `res` is further updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over `cnt` using `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, so we need to adjust the state of `cnt`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `cnt` is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`, it will be the next value in the sequence of values from `num_of_lens`.
   - Therefore, `cnt` will be the next value in the dictionary `num_of_lens`.

5. **Updating States**:
   - `total_count` will be updated to this new `cnt`.
   - `res` will be updated based on the new `cnt` as described in the problem statement.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `total_count` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `res` will be updated based on this new `total_count`.

Since we don't know the exact value of the next `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`, we can represent the state in a general form.

**State:**
- `total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `res` is updated based on this new `total_count`.

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` is `cnt_next`.

**Concrete Example:**
- If the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` is `cnt_next`, then:
  - `total_count` is `cnt_next`.
  - `res` will be updated based on `cnt_next`.

**State:**
- `total_count` is `cnt_next`.
- `res` is updated based on `cnt_next`.

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is updated based on this new `total_count`**.
