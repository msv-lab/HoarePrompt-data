Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `c` is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order, `len(a)` must be at least 4, and the current value of `t2` is greater than `t1`.**
