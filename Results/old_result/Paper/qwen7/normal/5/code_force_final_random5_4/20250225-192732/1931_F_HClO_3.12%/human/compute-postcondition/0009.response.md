Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input split, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split, `n` is an integer input from the first split, and `m` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input. It splits the input into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a1`. The rest of the integers are collected into a list `l1`. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `n` being the integer input from the first split and `m` being 1.
