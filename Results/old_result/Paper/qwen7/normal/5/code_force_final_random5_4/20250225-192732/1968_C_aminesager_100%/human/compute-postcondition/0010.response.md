Output State: **`a` now contains the new element `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`, which is the sum of the last element of `a` (`a[i - 1]`) and the corresponding element from the list `T` (`T[i - 1]`). The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
