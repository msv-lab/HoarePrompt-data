Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in c`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `c`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `counter` is increased by 1 (this is not part of the loop head, so it does not affect the loop execution).
   - `c` is a non-empty string.
   - `x` is the first character of `c`.
   - The most internal loop or if statement continues as normal (this is not part of the loop head, so it does not affect the loop execution).

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `c`, after the first iteration, `x` would have been set to the first character of `c`.
   - For the loop to continue, `c` must still be a non-empty string because the loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `c`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `c` must still be a non-empty string.
- `x` will be set to the next character in `c`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the second character of `c`**
