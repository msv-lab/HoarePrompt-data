Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 2`, `i` is less than `n`, `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

The code increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `n`, `i`, and `mid` were part of the initial state and their values were not altered by the code, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `rightZero`.
