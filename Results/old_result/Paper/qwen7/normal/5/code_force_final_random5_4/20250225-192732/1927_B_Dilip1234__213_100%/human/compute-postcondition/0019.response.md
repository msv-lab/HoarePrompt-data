Postcondition: **`j` is incremented by 1; if `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is updated to the current value of `s` plus the character corresponding to `j + 1` in the alphabet starting from 'a', and `char_count[j]` is increased by 1. If `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`, no changes are made to `s` and `char_count[j]` remains unchanged.**
