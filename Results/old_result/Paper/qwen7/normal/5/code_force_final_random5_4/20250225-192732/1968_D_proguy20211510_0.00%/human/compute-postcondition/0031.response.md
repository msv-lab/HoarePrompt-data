Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` is a list with one element \((k - (0 + 1)) * maxa\), `s` is a list with one element \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\)**.

Explanation: The code `s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)` appends a new element to the list `s`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `(i + 1)` is 2. Therefore, the new element added to `s` is \((k - 2) * maxa\). All other variables remain unchanged.
