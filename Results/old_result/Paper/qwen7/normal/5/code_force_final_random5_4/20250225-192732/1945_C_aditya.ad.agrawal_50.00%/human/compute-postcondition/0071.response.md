Output State: **`input_string` is the input received from the user, `t` is 1, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is the total number of 1s initially minus the total number of 1s encountered, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` was last satisfied, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos` at the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code sets `z_l` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
