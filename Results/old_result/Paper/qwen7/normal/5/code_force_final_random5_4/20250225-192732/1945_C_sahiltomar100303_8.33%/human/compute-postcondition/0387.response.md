Output State: **`left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is equal to `leftZero` - 2, `rightZero` is equal to `rightZero` + 1, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `leftZero` is equal to `leftZero` - 1, so after the increment, `leftZero` becomes `leftZero` - 2. The conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` must still hold true as per the initial state.
