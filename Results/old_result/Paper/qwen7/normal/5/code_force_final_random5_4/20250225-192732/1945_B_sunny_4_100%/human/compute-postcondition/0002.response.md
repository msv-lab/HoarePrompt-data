State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and we read an input for `t`, `qi` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable in the for loop is `qi`.
2. The loop runs from `range(t)`, meaning `qi` will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer, and `qi` must start at 0 before the loop begins.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `qi` is 0 and `t` is within the specified range.
