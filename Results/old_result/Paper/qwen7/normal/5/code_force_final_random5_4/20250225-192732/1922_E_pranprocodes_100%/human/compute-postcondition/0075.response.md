Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 0.5, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 with -100000000 appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Since `min` can be either -100000000 or -99999999, the new value appended to `ans` will be -100000000 (as it is the lower value between the two options). All other variables remain unchanged.
