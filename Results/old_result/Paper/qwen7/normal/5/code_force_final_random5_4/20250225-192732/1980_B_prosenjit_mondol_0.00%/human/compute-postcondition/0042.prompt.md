Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are positive integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer decreased by 1, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`. After executing the if-else block, the value of `a[k]` remains unchanged regardless of whether `a[k]` is greater than or equal to `x` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f-1` in list `a`, `n` is the input integer from the first split, `k` is the input integer decreased by 2. If `a[k] > x`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f-1` in list `a`, `n` is the integer from the first split, `f` is `f` decreased by 1, `k` is the integer from the first split decreased by 3. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of these variables, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
