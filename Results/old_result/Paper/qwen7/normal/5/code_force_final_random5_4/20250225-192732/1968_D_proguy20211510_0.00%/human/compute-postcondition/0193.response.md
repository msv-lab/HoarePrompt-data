Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` contains an element which is `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, then `foundb` is True. Otherwise, `pb` is equal to `p[pb - 1]`.
