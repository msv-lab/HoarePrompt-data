Output State: **`num` is the third element of `N`, and `cur` is equal to `num + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is initially set to the value of `num`. After executing `cur += 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1. Since `num` is the third element of `N`, `cur` now holds the value of `num + 1`. The value of `num` remains unchanged.
