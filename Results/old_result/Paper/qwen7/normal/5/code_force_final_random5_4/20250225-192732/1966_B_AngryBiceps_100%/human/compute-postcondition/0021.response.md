Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being an input provided by the user during the respective iteration of the loop; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in the list `a`, repeated according to their position in the list (i.e., the last character of the first string appears once, the last character of the second string appears twice, and so on); `i` is `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations; `n` remains as the initial input provided by the user; and either the first character of the first string in `a` is not the same for all strings in `a` or the last character of the last string in `a` is not the same for all strings in `a` or both**.
