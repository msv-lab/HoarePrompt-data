Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 1.
- `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1. Since `x` is already 1, `t` would be 0 because no iterations are needed for `x` to become 1.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is 99999997.
- `min` is -100000000.
- `ans` is a list containing alternating values of 99999997 and -100000000. The list is reversed, but since the specific elements are not relevant to the `print(t)` statement, we only need to know the value of `t`.

Given this information, the `print(t)` statement will print the value of `t`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
