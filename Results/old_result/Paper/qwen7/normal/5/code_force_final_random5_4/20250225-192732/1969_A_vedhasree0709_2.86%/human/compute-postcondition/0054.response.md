The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Since `i` is already 2, the only way to ensure the loop can execute again is to adjust `n` such that `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 2. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
