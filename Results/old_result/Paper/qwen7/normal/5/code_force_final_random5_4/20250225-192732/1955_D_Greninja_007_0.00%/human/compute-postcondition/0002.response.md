Output State: **`b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in list `b`, `a` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length m such that m <= n, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 <= k <= m, and `good_subarrays` is 0; `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the first `m` elements of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new Counter object named `window_freq` which counts the frequency of each element in the first `m` elements of list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
