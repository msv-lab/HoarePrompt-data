Postcondition: `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 8, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is not equal to `n`. The absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, or the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right` is less than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left`.
