Postcondition: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `eta[j]` remains unchanged, `q` remains unchanged, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`, and the current value of `j` is greater than 1000, leading to a break from the most internal loop or if statement.**
