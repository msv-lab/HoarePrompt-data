### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading four pairs of coordinates into a list `a`.

2. **Extracting X-coordinates**:
   - The program extracts the x-coordinates of the points into a list `x` using a list comprehension.

3. **Calculating Side Length**:
   - The side length of the square is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`).
   - Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined solely from the x-coordinates (or equivalently, the y-coordinates).

4. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area of the square is correctly computed as `dx * dx`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the area of the square for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the example input/output, this program appears to correctly identify the side length of the square by examining the x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) and then calculates the area accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
