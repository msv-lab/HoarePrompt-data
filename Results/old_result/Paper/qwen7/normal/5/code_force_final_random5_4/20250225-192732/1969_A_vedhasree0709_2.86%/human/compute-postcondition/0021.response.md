Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `j` is 1.

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**: The loop condition depends on `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2, but we need to ensure that `i <= n - 1` holds true for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` should be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, `n - 1` must be at least 3 (because 2 <= 3 is true).
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 (since `n - 1` must be at least 3).

6. **Other states do not affect the loop condition**:
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. This list does not affect the loop condition.
   - `j` is 1 and does not affect the loop condition either.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be at least 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1**
