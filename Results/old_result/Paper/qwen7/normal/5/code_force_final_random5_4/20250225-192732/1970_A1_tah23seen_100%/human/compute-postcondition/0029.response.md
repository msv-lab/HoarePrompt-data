Output State: **`ans` is `ans` plus `s[i]`, `i` is the second value of the next tuple in `d`, `j` is the second value of the next tuple in `d`, `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[i]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `s[i]`. The value of `i` remains the same as it was before the operation, which is the first value of the next tuple in `d`. Since the tuple's second value is accessed again without changing, `j` remains unchanged. The list `d` and its sorting criteria also remain unaffected.
