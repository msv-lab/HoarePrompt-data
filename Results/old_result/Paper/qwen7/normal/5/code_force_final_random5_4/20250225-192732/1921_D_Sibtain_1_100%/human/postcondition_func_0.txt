The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two sequences of integers \(a\) and \(c\), sorts them, and calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted sequences. If the sequences are identical, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the calculated sum. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
