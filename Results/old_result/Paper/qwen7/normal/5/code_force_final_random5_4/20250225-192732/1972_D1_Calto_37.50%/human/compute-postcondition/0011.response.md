Output State: **`cnt` is 2, `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `x` is `-9`, `y` is 9**

Explanation: The code `y = i * i` assigns the value of `i * i` (which is `3 * 3` or `9`) to `y`. The values of `cnt`, `i`, `m`, `x`, and `y` are updated accordingly. The value of `x` remains `-9` because `x` is defined as `n - 12` and no value for `n` was provided, so it retains its initial value. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
