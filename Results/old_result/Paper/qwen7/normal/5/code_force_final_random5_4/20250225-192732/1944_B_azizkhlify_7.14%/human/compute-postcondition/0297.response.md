Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 2 or has not been checked, depending on the condition being true or false
   - The condition `ul == k * 2` is used to break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - At the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current State Before the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` (which corresponds to `l[a[2] - 1]`) will be either 2 or has not been checked, depending on the condition being true or false.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `ul == k * 2` still needs to be considered, but since it does not directly affect the value of `i`, we do not need to change it for the state adjustment.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `l[a[i] - 1]`.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a positive integer
- `l[a[2] - 1]` is either 2 or has not been checked, depending on the condition being true or false

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `l[a[2] - 1]` is either 2 or has not been checked, depending on the condition being true or false**
