Output State: `cur` is either -1 or equal to the last element in `N`. `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` was encountered during the loop's execution. If `cur` was -1, it means no valid `cur` was found that satisfied the conditions inside the loop, and `M[-1]` will reflect the total number of elements in `N`. If `cur` was updated, `M[cur]` will be the count of elements in `N` that are greater than or equal to `cur`.
