Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers input from the user, and the final condition is either `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` or `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange`.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. This changes the values of `l` and `r` to the integers provided by the user. However, the values of `onesInRange`, `sumInRange`, `q`, and the final condition remain unchanged from their initial state.
