Output State: **`pos` is increased by 2, `o_l` is 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1**.

The value of `pos` is increased by 2, which means `pos` was previously calculated as its current value plus 2. The value of `o_l` remains 1. The code `o_r -= 1` decrements `o_r` by 1, so `o_r` is now one less than its previous value.
