Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. The program instead calculates the distance between the first and last black cells, which does not necessarily give the minimum segment length required to turn all cells white.

For example, consider the input "WBWBWWWBW". According to the problem description, the minimum length of the segment to be repainted white is 7 (painting from the 2nd to the 8th cell). However, the program incorrectly outputs 4 because it calculates the distance between the first and last black cells (2nd and 7th cells).

To fix this, the program should iterate through the string to find the longest sequence of consecutive white cells and then calculate the length of the segment needed to cover any remaining black cells.
