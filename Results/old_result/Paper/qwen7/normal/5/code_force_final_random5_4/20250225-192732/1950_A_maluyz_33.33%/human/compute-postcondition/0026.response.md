Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where `a`, `b`, and `c` are either in the order `a < b < c` or they are not all equal and the maximum value among them is either `b` or not equal to `b`, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.**

In this state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input integers provided by the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the input operation. Similarly, the value of `i` remains 1 as it was not involved in the input operation. The conditions about the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` remain valid.
