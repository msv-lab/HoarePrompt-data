Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1()` is designed to precompute the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200000 and store them in a list named `values`.
2. The input for each test case is read and used to access the precomputed cumulative sum directly from the `values` list, which is efficient given the constraints.
3. The logic for calculating the sum of digits of a number and updating the `values` list is correct.
4. The function correctly handles the range of inputs specified (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5).
5. The precomputation step ensures that each query can be answered in constant time, which is crucial given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

Given the above points, the implementation is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
