Output State: **pos is 3, n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, arr is the result of the function func_2() call, and i is n.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for each value of `i` from 0 to `n-1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The loop checks if `arr[i]` equals `k` and updates `pos` accordingly. Since the loop has completed all iterations, it means that either `k` was found in the array `arr` and `pos` was updated to the index where `k` was found, or `k` was not found in the array, and `pos` remained -1. Given the final state after 3 iterations, we can infer that `k` was found at index 3 (since `pos` is 3 after 3 iterations), and thus, after completing all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
