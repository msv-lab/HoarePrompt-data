Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`
- `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2

We need to determine the value of `a[i]` to understand what will be printed. From the second piece of information, we know that `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2. This implies that `a[i] - 1` is the index in the list `r` where the value 2 is located. However, without knowing the exact value of `a[i]`, we can only express it in terms of the condition given.

Given that `i` is `n`, the print statement will access `a[n]` twice and then print a space (`end=' '`).

To summarize:
- `a[i]` is `a[n]`
- Since `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `a[n] - 1` is the index in `r` where the value 2 is found, but we don't have the exact value of `a[n]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a[n]` twice followed by a space.

Output: **a[n] a[n]**
