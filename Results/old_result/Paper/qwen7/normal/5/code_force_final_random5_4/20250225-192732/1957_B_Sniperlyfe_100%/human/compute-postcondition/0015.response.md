Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is updated to `k - min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 3.
- The line `k = k - min(nums[0] + 1, k)` updates the value of `k`. Since the exact value of `k` is not given, we keep it in terms of the expression.
- The line `nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)` sets `nums[i]` (where `i` is 3) to the value of `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
