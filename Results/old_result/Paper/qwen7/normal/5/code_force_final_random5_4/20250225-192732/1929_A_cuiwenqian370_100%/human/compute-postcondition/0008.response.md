Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `index` is increased by 1; `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `array` by converting the elements in the slice of `data` starting from `index` and ending at `index + n` (exclusive) into integers using the `map` function. The values of `data[0]`, `n`, and `index` remain unchanged except that `index` is incremented by 1. The newly created list `array` contains the integer values from the specified slice of `data`.
