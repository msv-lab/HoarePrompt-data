Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program is correct based on the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function iterates from `x-1` down to `2` (since `y` must be less than `x`).
   - It checks if `x` is divisible by `y` (`x % y == 0`).
   - If `2 * y >= x`, it returns `y` immediately because this condition ensures that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.
   - Otherwise, it keeps track of the maximum value of `y` that satisfies the divisibility condition and returns it at the end.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the given integer `x` and prints the result.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly finds an integer `y` such that `\gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized for each test case. The provided examples also validate that the solution works as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
