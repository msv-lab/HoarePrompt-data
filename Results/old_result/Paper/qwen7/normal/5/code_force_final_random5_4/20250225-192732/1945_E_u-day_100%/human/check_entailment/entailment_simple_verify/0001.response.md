### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to rearrange a permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps such that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing a binary search.
- The binary search should end with `p[l] == x`.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Function Definitions**
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the result of `func_1()` into a list of integers.
   - `func_3()`: Implements the main logic for solving the problem.

2. **Main Logic in `func_3()`**
   - **Step 1**: Read the input values `n` and `k`.
   - **Step 2**: Read the permutation `arr`.
   - **Step 3**: Find the position `pos` of `k` in the permutation.
   - **Step 4**: Initialize `low` and `high` for the binary search.
   - **Step 5**: Perform the binary search:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
     - Add `mid` to a set `st` to avoid infinite loops.
     - Adjust `low` and `high` based on the comparison between `arr[mid]` and `k`.
   - **Step 6**: Check if `arr[low]` equals `k`:
     - If true, print `0` (no swaps needed).
     - Otherwise, print `1` and the positions to swap.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment
1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search logic in the provided code does not correctly handle the case where `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` after the initial binary search.
   - The program assumes that the binary search will always find `k` without considering the possibility of needing additional swaps.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program attempts to swap elements to place `k` at the correct position, but it does not ensure that the binary search will work correctly after the swaps.
   - The logic for determining the positions to swap is not robust and may not always produce the correct result.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code
- **Initial State**: The program reads `t` (number of test cases) and iterates over each test case.
- **Function 1 (`func_1()`)**: Reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
- **Function 2 (`func_2()`)**: Converts the result of `func_1()` into a list of integers.
- **Function 3 (`func_3()`)**:
  - **Step 1**: Reads `n` and `k` using `func_1()`.
  - **Step 2**: Reads the permutation `arr` using `func_2()`.
  - **Step 3**: Finds the position `pos` of `k` in the permutation.
  - **Step 4**: Initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
  - **Step 5**: Performs the binary search:
    - **Inner Loop**: Calculates the middle index `mid` and adds it to a set `st` to avoid infinite loops.
    - **Adjusts `low` and `high`**: Compares `arr[mid]` with `k` and adjusts `low` and `high` accordingly.
  - **Step 6**: Checks if `arr[low]` equals `k`:
    - If true, prints `0` (no swaps needed).
    - Otherwise, prints `1` and the positions to swap.

#### Correctness of the Program
- The program correctly identifies the position of `k` in the permutation.
- The binary search logic is implemented correctly, ensuring that the search interval is halved appropriately.
- The program handles the case where `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` by printing `1` and the positions to swap.

However, the original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program is incorrect due to issues with the binary search implementation and swapping logic. Upon closer inspection, the program does indeed handle the binary search and swapping correctly within the constraints of the problem.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the annotated code.
