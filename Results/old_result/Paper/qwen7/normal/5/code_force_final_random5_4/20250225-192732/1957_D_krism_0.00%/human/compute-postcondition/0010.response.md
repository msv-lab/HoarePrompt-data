Output State: The `prefix` list will contain the integer 0 followed by the cumulative XOR of all elements in the list `arr`. Specifically, if `arr = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`, then `prefix` will be `[0, a1, a1 ^ a2, a1 ^ a2 ^ a3, ..., a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ an]`. The variable `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `n` remains an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The list `arr` is unchanged and consists of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `prefix` will hold the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting from 0, and `t` and `n` will retain their initial values.
