Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The key issue lies in the loop where the `start_year` is being updated. The current implementation uses the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` to update `start_year`, but this does not correctly simulate the sequential waiting period for each sign.

The correct approach should be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities `a_i`. This LCM will give the year when all signs will occur sequentially. The current implementation instead updates `start_year` in a way that does not reflect the sequential waiting periods correctly.

To fix this, we need to calculate the LCM of all the numbers in the list `nums`.

Correctness: **False**
