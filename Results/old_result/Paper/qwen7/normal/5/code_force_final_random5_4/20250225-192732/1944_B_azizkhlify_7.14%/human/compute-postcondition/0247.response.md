Postcondition: `i` is `n + 2`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, `ul` equals `ur`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then the condition remains unchanged. If `r[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 2, the condition also remains unchanged.
