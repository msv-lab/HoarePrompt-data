Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer (1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5), `q` is an input integer (1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5), an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and `q` subarray queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`.**

The code reads two integers `n` and `q` from input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the placeholders for `n` and `q` in the initial state, but the array `c` and the subarray queries remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these updated values for `n` and `q`, while retaining the original description of `c` and the subarray queries.
