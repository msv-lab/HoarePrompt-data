Output State: **`ans` is `ans` plus `s[i]`, `i` is the first value of the first tuple in `d`, `j` is the second value of the first tuple in `d`, `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index.**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[i]` adds the value of `s[i]` to `ans`. Here, `i` is the first value of the first tuple in `d`, which remains unchanged. The state of `j` and the list `d` also remain unaffected. Therefore, `ans` is updated by adding `s[i]` to its current value.
