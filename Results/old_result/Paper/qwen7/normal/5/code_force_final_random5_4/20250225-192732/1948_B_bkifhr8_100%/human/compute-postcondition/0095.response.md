Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 2`, `m` must be at least 3, `arr[i]` is the last element of `nums`, and `nums` is a list of integers formed by converting each digit of `arr[i - 1]` into an integer and appending `arr[i]` to it.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `ans` to `False`, which does not affect the values of `i`, `m`, `arr[i]`, or `nums`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
