Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is converted to a list of integers where each integer is from the split string representation of `a`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i > 0`, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i > 0`, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is 2 if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i > 0`, otherwise `n` is 1, `c` is a list containing either the value `x` or one additional element which is `a[i]` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `c` (where `n` is the index of `c`), otherwise `c` remains as a list containing either 0 and `x` or the element `a[0]` if `a[0]` is greater than 10, otherwise `c` is a list containing the element `a[0]`, `i` is 0 or `i+1` depending on the condition, and `len(a)` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i > 0`, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i > 0`, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is 4 if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i > 0`, otherwise `n` is 1, `c` is a list containing `x` and `y`, `i` is 4, and `y` is updated to be the integer division of `a[3]` by 10. If `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `c`, `c` contains `x` and `y`; otherwise, `c` remains as a list containing `0` and `x` or the element `a[0]` if `a[0]` is greater than 10, otherwise `c` is a list containing the element `a[0]`.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, taking into account the initial state (precondition) and the changes after executing the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 5, `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[5]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[5]` divided by 10 as an integer, `c` contains either `[y, x]` or the element `a[5]` depending on whether `y` is less than or equal to `x`, and `n` is adjusted to `n + 2` if `y <= x` and `n + 1` otherwise. If `i == 0` and `a[5] > 10`, then `x` is `a[5] % 10`, `y` is `a[5] // 10`, and `c` contains either `[y, x]` if `y <= x` or `a[5]` if `y > x`, with `n` being either `n + 2` or `n + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
