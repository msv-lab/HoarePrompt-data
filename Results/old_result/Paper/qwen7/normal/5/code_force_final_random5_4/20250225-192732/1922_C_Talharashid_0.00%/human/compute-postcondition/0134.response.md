Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is `end` - 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start < end` is true, or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` if `start < end` is false.**

Explanation: The code calculates `s1` as the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, and `s2` (before the calculation of `s1`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `s2` depends on the condition `start < end`, but since the condition itself hasn't been evaluated, `s2` retains its original definition.
