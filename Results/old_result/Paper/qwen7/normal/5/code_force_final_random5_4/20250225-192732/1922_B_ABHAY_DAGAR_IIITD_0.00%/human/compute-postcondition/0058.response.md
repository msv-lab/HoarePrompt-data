Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in num_list:`. The variables involved here are `x` and `num_list`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x` will take on the values from `num_list` one by one during each iteration of the loop.
   - `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since `x` will take on the values from `num_list`, we need to ensure that `num_list` is not empty for the loop to execute. If `num_list` is empty, the loop will not run even once.
   - The initial state of `x` will be the first element of `num_list` when the loop starts its first iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num_list` must not be empty for the loop to execute.
- `x` will be the first element of `num_list` when the loop starts its first iteration.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `total_count` is the sum of all values in the original `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in the original `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, `x` is the first element of `num_list`**.
