Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `position` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`, `health` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the position from the tuple in the `monsters` list at index `i + 1`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`, `distance` is now `abs(position)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `distance` to be the absolute value of `position`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
