Output State: The final value of `values[i]` will be the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers, and `sum_value_digits` will hold the same sum of these integer values.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `values[i]` will be the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` when each character is converted to an integer. The variable `sum_value_digits` will contain the same sum of these integer values.
