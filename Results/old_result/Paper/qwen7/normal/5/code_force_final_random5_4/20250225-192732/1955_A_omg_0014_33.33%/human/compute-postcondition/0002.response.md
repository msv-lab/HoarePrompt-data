State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0, as specified by `range(n)`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- The value of `t` (which is between 1 and \(10^4\)) does not affect the loop's execution condition directly. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.
