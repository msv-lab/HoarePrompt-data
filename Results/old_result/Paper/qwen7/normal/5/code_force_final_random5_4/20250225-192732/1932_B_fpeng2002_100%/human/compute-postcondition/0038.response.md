Output State: **`x` is 1; `start_year` is ((start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])**

Explanation: Initially, `x` is set to 1 and `start_year` is calculated as `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. The code then updates `start_year` to `((start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])`, which translates to `((start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])` since `x` is 1. The value of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` are not provided, so they remain as part of the expression.
