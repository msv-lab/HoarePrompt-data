Output State: **`t` remains the same or is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input string `s`, `b` is the second integer in the input string `s`, the sum of `a` and `b` remains even if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is true. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, `s` is the input string from the user, `s` is now the string input by the user.**

The code `s = input()` takes the input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
