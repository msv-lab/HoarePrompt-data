Output State: **`right` is less than `n` and `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`; `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `trightOne` is decreased by 1. The conditions involving `right`, `n`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged from the initial state.
