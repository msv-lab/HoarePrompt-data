Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` by splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of `num_tests` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
