Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). It processes `arr` to create a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique integer from `arr` and its value is the minimum frequency of that integer in `arr` capped at `k`. After processing, the function returns this dictionary.**
