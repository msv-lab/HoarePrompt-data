Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `index` is increased by 1 + `n`; `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`; `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(array)` to the list `results`. The values of other variables (`data[0]`, `n`, `index`, `array`, and `result`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The only new information is that `results` now contains the `result` of the function call.
