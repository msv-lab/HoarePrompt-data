Output State: **`j` is decreased by 1, and to ensure the loop continues, `j_new` must be greater than 0 and `arr[j_new]` must be equal to `arr[j_new - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `j -= 1` decreases the value of `j` by 1. The conditions for ensuring the loop continues (`j_new > 0` and `arr[j_new] == arr[j_new - 1]`) remain unchanged and are still valid after the execution of the code.
