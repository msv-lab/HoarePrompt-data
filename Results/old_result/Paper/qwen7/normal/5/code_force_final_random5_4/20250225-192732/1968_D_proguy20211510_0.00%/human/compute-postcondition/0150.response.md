Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxs` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`.
- The condition `maxs > maxb` is now false, and `maxs` is less than `maxb`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

This statement will print the string `'Bodya'` directly, regardless of the values of `maxs` and `maxb`.

Output: **'Bodya'**
