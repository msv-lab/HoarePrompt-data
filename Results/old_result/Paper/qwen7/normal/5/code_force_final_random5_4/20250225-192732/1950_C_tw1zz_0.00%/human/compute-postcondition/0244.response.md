Output State: **`user_input` is `user_input - 1`, `h` is a string from the input split by ':', `m` is a string from the input split by ':', `h1` is '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value '12' to the variable `h1`. The other variables (`user_input`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, and `time`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
