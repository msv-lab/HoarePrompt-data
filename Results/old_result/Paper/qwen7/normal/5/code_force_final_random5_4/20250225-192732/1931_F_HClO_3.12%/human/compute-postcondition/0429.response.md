Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple unpacking `(a3, l3)` from the list `val`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `val` that can be unpacked into `a3` and `l3`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` are integers.
   - `val` is a list containing at least `m-1` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`.
   - If `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `l3` is equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the same conditions hold but no action is taken within the if-else block.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the tuples in `val`, at the end of the previous iteration, one tuple has been processed.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, we need to remove the first tuple from `val` and update the values of `a3` and `l3` accordingly.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `val` will now contain one less tuple than before.
   - `a3` and `l3` will be updated to the values of the next tuple in `val`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`**.
