Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined but they are not used to solve the problem described. The problem requires distributing coins in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. However, the provided code does not contain any logic related to this requirement. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
n = 3
k = [3, 2, 7]
```
The program should output a distribution of bets such that the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome. However, since the code does not implement this logic, it will not produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
