Output State: **number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers, the size of generated sequence is 0**

Explanation: The provided code is a docstring for a function and does not actually execute any code that would modify the variables. It describes what the function does but does not perform the actions described. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged. The size of the generated sequence is 0 because no sequence has been generated yet.
