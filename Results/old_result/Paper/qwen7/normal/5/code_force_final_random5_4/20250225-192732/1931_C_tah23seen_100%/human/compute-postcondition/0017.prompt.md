Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is the length of `arr`; `j` is the length of `arr` - 1; all consecutive elements in `arr` from index 0 to `i-1` must be equal.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `arr`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in `arr` as long as they were consecutive duplicates. The variable `j` remains unchanged at the length of `arr` - 1, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` (which is effectively all elements in `arr`) must be identical.
Code of the loop:
while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
    j -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `j` is decreased by 1, and to ensure the loop continues, `j_new` must be greater than 0 and `arr[j_new]` must be equal to `arr[j_new - 1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `j` is decreased by 1, and to ensure the loop continues, `j_new` must be greater than 0 and `arr[j_new]` must be equal to `arr[j_new - 1]'


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
