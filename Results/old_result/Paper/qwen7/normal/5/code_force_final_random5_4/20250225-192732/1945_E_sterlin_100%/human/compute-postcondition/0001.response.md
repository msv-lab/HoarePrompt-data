Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an external input consisting of an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and x, and a permutation p of length n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a list of strings, each string containing two integers n and x, and a permutation p of length n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n.**
