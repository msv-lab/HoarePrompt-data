The only variables in the loop head are `i`, so we can only adjust `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `3` (inclusive), meaning `i` should be less than `4` for the loop to continue.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `1`.

Therefore, the new state of `i` will be `1`.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`**
