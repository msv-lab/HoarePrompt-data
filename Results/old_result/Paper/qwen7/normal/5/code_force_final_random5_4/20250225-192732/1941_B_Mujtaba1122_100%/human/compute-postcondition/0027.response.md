Output State: **`i` is 2; `list[2]` is `list[2] - 2 * list[1] - 1`; `list[1]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` simplifies to `list[i - 1] -= list[i - 1]`, which means `list[i - 1]` is set to 0. Given that `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1, so `list[1]` is set to 0. However, since the initial state specified that `list[1]` is greater than 0, and the code does not change this condition, we keep it as `list[1]` is greater than 0. The other conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `list[2]` is updated to `list[2] - 2 * list[1] - 1`.
