Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `i` is 5, `sum[2]` is `sum[1] + nums[1] - 1, `ones[5]` is `ones[4] + (1 if nums[4] == 1 else 0)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ones[i]` to be `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`. Given that `i` was initially 4, after executing the line of code, `i` becomes 5. The value of `ones[5]` is calculated based on the value of `ones[4]` and whether `nums[4]` is equal to 1. Since `sum[2]` was already defined as `sum[1] + nums[1] - 1`, this does not change.
