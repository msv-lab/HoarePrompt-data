Output State: **The final state will depend on the initial value of `t` (number of test cases). After processing all iterations, the following conditions will hold:**

- `left` will be 0 if the number of '1's from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise it will be `right`.
- `right` will be `n`.
- `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` will be updated based on the counts of '0's and '1's from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right` and from the initial `right` to the end of the string.
- `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` will be the counts of '0's and '1's from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right` and from the initial `right` to the end of the string, respectively.
- `leftMove` will be the total number of moves made by the `left` pointer during the loop iterations.
- `i` will be equal to `n` after the last iteration.
- `mid` will remain as `n // 2`.
- `s` will be the input string.
- `tleftZero` and `trightZero` will be the cumulative counts of '0's from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right`.
- `tleftOne` and `trightOne` will be the cumulative counts of '1's from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right`.

If `right` is equal to `n`, the updates to `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` are based on the number of '0's and '1's from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right` and from the initial `right` to the end of the string. If the number of '1's from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the values of `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the updates to `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` are based on the number of '0's and '1's from the initial `right` to the end of the string and from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right`.
