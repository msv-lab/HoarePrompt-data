Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `qi` is 2.
- `a` is the first integer input.
- `b` is the second integer input.
- `m` is the third integer input.
- `ans` is calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not explicitly provided, we can only express `ans` in terms of these variables.

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2**
