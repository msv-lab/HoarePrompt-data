Output State: `number` must be at least 31, `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0, `size` is 5.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as \( (1 << size + 1) - 1 \leq number \). This expression simplifies to \( 2^{size+1} - 1 \). After 3 iterations, `size` is 4 and `number` must be at least 15. For each additional iteration, `size` increases by 1. Therefore, after 5 iterations, `size` will be 5, and `number` must satisfy \( 2^{5+1} - 1 = 31 \). The `sequence` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
