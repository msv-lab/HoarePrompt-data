Reasoning:
- The problem requires rearranging the permutation array using at most 2 swaps to ensure that the element `x` is at the `l` position when performing a binary search.
- The provided code in `func_3()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not account for the necessary swaps to place `x` at the correct position.
- The function `func_3()` performs a binary search to find the position where `x` should be placed but does not handle the swaps needed to achieve this.
- The function `func_3()` does not return any value and instead prints directly to the console, which is not aligned with the requirement to output the number of operations and the specific swaps performed.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
