Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the time and is equal to '22', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is equal to '10', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `h1 = '10'` assigns the string `'10'` to the variable `h1`. The values of `t`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, and `time` remain unchanged from their initial states.
