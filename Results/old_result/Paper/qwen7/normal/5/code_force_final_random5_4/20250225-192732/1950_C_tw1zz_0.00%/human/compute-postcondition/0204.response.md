Output State: **`user_input` is `user_input - 1`, `h` is a string from the input split by ':', `m` is a string from the input split by ':', `h1` is '04', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `h1 = '04'` assigns the string `'04'` to the variable `h1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
