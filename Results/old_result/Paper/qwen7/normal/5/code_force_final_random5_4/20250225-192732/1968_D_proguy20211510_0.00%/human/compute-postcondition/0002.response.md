Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `p` is a permutation of length `n`; `a` is an array of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i; `YES` and `NO` are string values 'YES' and 'NO' respectively; `MOD` is set to 10^9 + 7; `alpha` is a string containing the characters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**

The code initializes the variable `alpha` with the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so they remain as described in the initial state.
