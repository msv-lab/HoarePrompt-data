Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `N` that was greater than `cur` at some point during the loop, and the value for each such key is 1. For any `num` in `N` that was not greater than `cur`, the value in `M` is 2. `cnt` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary that must have at least one key, `cnt` is a list. If the key `k` in dictionary `M` equals 1, then `cnt` contains the key `k`. There is no else part provided, so the state of `cnt` remains unchanged if `M[k]` does not equal 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary that must have at least one key, and `cnt` is a list with an additional element `k` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary that still has at least one key left to iterate over, `cnt` is a list with the key `k` appended to it. If `M[k]` equals 1, the function continues with the current state. Otherwise, the function still maintains the same state as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
