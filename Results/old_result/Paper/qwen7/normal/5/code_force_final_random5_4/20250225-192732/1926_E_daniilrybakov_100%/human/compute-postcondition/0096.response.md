Output State: **`s` is `x + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `n` is `n // 2`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is four times its original value.**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` doubles the value of `m`. Since `m` was originally twice its original value, doubling it again results in `m` being four times its original value. The values of `s`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
