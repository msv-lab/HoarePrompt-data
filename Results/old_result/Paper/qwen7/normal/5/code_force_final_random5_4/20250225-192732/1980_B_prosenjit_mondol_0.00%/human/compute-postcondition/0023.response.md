Output State: **`a` is updated to be the list of integers from the input split, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`, `n` is the input integer from the first split, `f` is `f` decreased by 1, `k` is the input integer decreased by 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `f` in list `a` to the variable `x`. The other variables (`n`, `f`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The list `a` is updated to the new list of integers from the input split.
