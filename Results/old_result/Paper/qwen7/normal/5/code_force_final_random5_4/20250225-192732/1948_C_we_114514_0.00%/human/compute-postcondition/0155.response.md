Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable in the given code is `test_case`.
   - Other relevant variables mentioned are `reachable_second_row`, `reachable_first_row`, and `results`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more `test_cases` to process.
   - Since `test_case` is being iterated over, the loop will proceed to the next `test_case` in the list.

3. **Adjust the States Based on the Loop Head:**
   - `test_case` will change to the next element in `test_cases`.
   - `reachable_second_row`, `reachable_first_row`, and `results` will remain in their current state unless the loop body modifies them.

Given the initial states:
- `j` equals `n`
- `reachable_second_row` is either `True` or `False` based on the if condition
- `reachable_first_row` remains in its last known state from the loop's final iteration
- `results` is a list containing either `['YES']` or `['NO']`

Since the loop head does not directly modify `j`, `reachable_second_row`, `reachable_first_row`, or `results`, these states will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `test_case` to the next element in `test_cases`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` equals `n`, `reachable_second_row` is either `True` or `False` based on the if condition, `reachable_first_row` remains in its last known state from the loop's final iteration, `results` is a list containing either `['YES']` or `['NO']`, and `test_case` is the next element in `test_cases`**
