Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.
- `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are lines left in the input file (or standard input) beyond the first line.

The code snippet provided is simply:

```python
print('-1')
```

This `print` statement will output the string `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or any other variables. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not used in this particular print statement.

Output: **-1**
