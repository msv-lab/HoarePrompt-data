You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be less than or equal to 0, and `nums` will contain `n` elements where the first element `nums[0]` is `(1 << (`k`.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and each subsequent element `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will be `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` was still positive after the previous iterations, otherwise `nums[i]` will be 0.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes, the index `i` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list (`n`), meaning the loop has processed all elements. The variable `k` will either be fully consumed (less than or equal to 0) or reduced to 0 during the last iteration if it couldn't be further decremented due to its value being smaller than `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. The `nums` list will start with a specific value based on `k` and then each following element will be the minimum possible value `k` could take in each iteration, ensuring no further decrements are possible.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements. The first element `nums[0]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and each subsequent element `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is `0` since `k` is non-positive.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `k` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements. The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. For each subsequent element `nums[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), the value is set to `0` if `k` is non-positive.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements. The first element `nums[0]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and each subsequent element `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is `0` since `k` is non-positive.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
