Postcondition: `c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the second character of `c`. If `x` is not found in `a[counter]` and `x` is also not found in `b[counter]`, `no` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `x` is found in either `a[counter]` or `b[counter]`, the value of `no` remains unchanged and the loop or if statement continues as normal.
