Based on the initial state provided:

- `eta_ln` is 1
- `j` is `n`
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `q[j]` is 0, but since `j` is `n`, this means `q[n]` is 0
- `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2
- `rho` is 0

We need to evaluate the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.

For the expression to be valid, `n` must be at least 3 because if `n` is less than 3, the expression would involve division by zero or negative numbers, which is not applicable here as `n` is a non-negative integer.

Let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 3 (since it must be at least 3):

- When `n = 3`, the expression becomes `3 * (3 - 1) * (3 - 2) // 6`
- Simplifying, we get `3 * 2 * 1 // 6`
- Which further simplifies to `6 // 6`
- This results in `1`

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the result of the evaluated expression.

Output: **1**
