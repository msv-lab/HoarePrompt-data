Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6). It iterates through a loop from 1 to `m-1`, calculating values for `x` and `y` based on the current index `i`. It updates a counter `cnt` based on these values. If `cnt` remains 0 after the loop, the function returns 1; otherwise, it also returns 1. The function always returns 1 regardless of the input values.**
