Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a binary string s is provided on a new line where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and s consists only of '0' and '1'. The function processes each binary string s and does not return anything explicitly.**

This means the function `func_2` accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` from the input, where the length of `s` is between 2 and 200,000 characters, and `s` contains only '0's and '1's. The function processes each binary string but does not return any specific value or output directly.
