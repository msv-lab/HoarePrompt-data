Output State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string with its first two characters removed, `i` is the third character of `s`, `one` is either 2 or 3, `cost` is increased by `one + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `cost += one + 1` increments the value of `cost` by the value of `one + 1`. Since `one` is either 2 or 3, `cost` will be increased by either 3 or 4. The values of `s`, `i`, and `one` remain unchanged.
