Output State: **`cur` is equal to `cur` + 1, `M` remains unchanged, and the sum of all values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. The dictionary `M` and its contents (which represent the counts of consecutive integers in the list `N`) remain unchanged because the code only modifies `cur`. The sum of all values in the dictionary `M` (denoted as `S`) also remains unchanged since no operations affect `M`.
