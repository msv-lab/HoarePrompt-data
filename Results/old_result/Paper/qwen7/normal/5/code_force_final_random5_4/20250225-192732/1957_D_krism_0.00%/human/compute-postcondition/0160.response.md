Output State: **`j` is 0, `c` is `prefix[32]`, `k` is 5, `y` is `arr[32]`, `ans` is updated by adding `pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0]`, `c` remains `prefix[32]`, `i` is now 34, and `pre[j][1]` is now 1.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 0, `pre[j][1]` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously mentioned states.
