Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.

2. **Determine the current values of `low` and `high`**:
   - `low` is either 0 or `mid`.
   - `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`.

3. **Determine the value of `mid`**:
   - `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`.

4. **Check the loop condition with the given values**:
   - For the loop to continue, `low + 1 < high` must be true.
   - Given that `mid = (0 + n) // 2`, let's consider the possible values of `low` and `high`:
     - If `low = 0` and `high = (0 + n) // 2`, then `low + 1 = 1` and `high = (0 + n) // 2`. Since `1 < (0 + n) // 2` is always true for `n > 1`, the loop will continue.
     - If `low = (0 + n) // 2` and `high = n`, then `low + 1 = (0 + n) // 2 + 1` and `high = n`. Since `(0 + n) // 2 + 1 < n` is always true for `n > 1`, the loop will continue.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `low + 1 < high` is true.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure that the condition `low + 1 < high` holds true.

Given the conditions, no specific adjustments are needed because the loop can certainly execute one more time based on the provided values. Therefore, we do not need to modify any states beyond ensuring the loop condition remains valid.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing the value `(0 + n) // 2`.**
