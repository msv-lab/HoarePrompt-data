Postcondition: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `x` in `num_list` and the new `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers, `x` is the first element in `num_list`, and `x` is not in `num_of_lens`**
