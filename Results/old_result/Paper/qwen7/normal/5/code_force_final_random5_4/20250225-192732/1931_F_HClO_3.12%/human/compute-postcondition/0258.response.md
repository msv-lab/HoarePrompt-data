Postcondition: **`idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `val` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `a3`, `l22` are set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2` plus 1; `l` is assigned the value of `l1` if `a1` appears before `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l` is assigned the value of `l2`.**
