Reasoning:
The given program aims to compute the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n` and store these cumulative sums in a list. This approach is efficient because it avoids recalculating the digit sums repeatedly for each test case. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Precomputation**: The program precomputes the cumulative sum of digit sums up to every number from 1 to 200000. This is done using a loop that iterates from 1 to 200000, calculating the sum of digits for each number and updating the cumulative sum accordingly.
2. **Input Handling**: For each test case, the program reads the value of `n` and uses the precomputed list to find the required sum of digit sums from 1 to `n`.

Given the constraints (where `t` can be up to 10^4 and `n` can be up to 2 * 10^5), this approach is efficient because it avoids the need to recalculate the digit sums for each `n` during the test cases. The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, and each query runs in O(1) time.

The execution summary indicates that the function correctly precomputes the cumulative sums and then uses these precomputed values to answer each test case efficiently. There are no apparent logical errors or inefficiencies in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
