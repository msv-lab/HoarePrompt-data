Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `start` is `start` - 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 3, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` if `start >= end`, and `s2` is 0, since `s` was initialized to 0 and no operation was performed on it.**

In this step, the code simply initializes `s` to 0. No other operations are performed, so the values of other variables remain unchanged.
