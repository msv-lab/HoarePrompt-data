Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `b` contains a list of unique characters sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from `b` is mapped to a unique lowercase letter starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the position of the character in the sorted unique character list. Specifically, the last unique character in the sorted list will be mapped to 'a', the second last to 'b', and so on, until the first unique character which will be mapped to 'z'.**

This means that if `b` has `n` unique characters, `char_map` will map these characters to the last `n` letters of the alphabet in reverse order.**
