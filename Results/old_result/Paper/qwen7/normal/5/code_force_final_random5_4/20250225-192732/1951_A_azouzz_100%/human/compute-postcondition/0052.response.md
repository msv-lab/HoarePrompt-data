Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `cnt1` equals 1, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`. If `cnt1` does not equal 1, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`.
