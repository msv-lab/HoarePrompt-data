Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B', `outind` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no loop or if statement is specified in the code snippet, the only change is that we acknowledge breaking out of such a structure. All other variables retain their initial values.
