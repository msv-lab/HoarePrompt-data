### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. It also correctly reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks**: The function checks if both players start with the maximum value in the array `a`. If both players start with the maximum value, it prints 'Draw'. This is correct because in this case, both players will have the same score if they follow the optimal strategy.

3. **Single Maximum Value Check**: The function checks if either player starts with the maximum value in the array `a`. If one player starts with the maximum value, it prints 'Bodya' or 'Sasha' accordingly. This is correct because the player starting with the maximum value will always have a higher score if they stay at their initial position for all turns.

4. **Dynamic Score Calculation**: The function calculates the scores for both players using a dynamic approach. However, the implementation of the dynamic score calculation is flawed. Specifically, the logic for updating the scores `b` and `s` does not correctly simulate the game's rules. The function assumes that the players will always move to the position indicated by the permutation `p` if they do not already have the maximum value, which is not necessarily true. The function does not account for the possibility that a player might choose to stay at their current position even if they have not yet reached the maximum value.

5. **Final Score Comparison**: After calculating the potential scores, the function compares the final scores of both players and prints the result accordingly. This part is incorrect because the scores calculated are not based on the actual game rules. The function does not correctly simulate the game's turns and the players' decisions to stay or move.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial Checks**: Correct.
- **Dynamic Score Calculation**: Incorrect. The function does not correctly simulate the game's turns and the players' decisions to stay or move.
- **Final Score Comparison**: Incorrect due to the flawed dynamic score calculation.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the function does not correctly simulate the game's turns and the players' decisions to stay or move. The dynamic score calculation is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
