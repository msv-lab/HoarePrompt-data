The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n`. It iterates through the list (excluding the first and last elements), and for each element, it checks if certain conditions are met. If the conditions are not met, it modifies the list by reducing the values of the current and previous elements. After the loop, it calls another function `func_1(list, n)`. Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. Regardless of the outcome, the final state of the list is such that all its elements are less than or equal to 0. The function does not return any value.
