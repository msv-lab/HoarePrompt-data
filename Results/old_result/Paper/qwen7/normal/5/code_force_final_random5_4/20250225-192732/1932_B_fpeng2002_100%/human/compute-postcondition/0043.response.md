Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is set to the length of the `nums` list.
   - `start_year` is updated iteratively using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` from 0 to the length of `nums` minus one.

2. **Understanding the Formula**:
   - For each iteration, the formula updates `start_year` based on the current value of `nums[x]`.
   - The formula ensures that `start_year` is adjusted such that it is always a multiple of `nums[x]`.

3. **Iterative Process**:
   - Let's assume `nums` is a list with elements `[a1, a2, ..., an]`.
   - Initially, `x = len(nums)`.
   - The loop runs from `x = 0` to `x = len(nums) - 1`.
   - For each `x`, `start_year` is updated using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

4. **Final Value of `start_year`**:
   - After the loop completes, `x` will be equal to the length of `nums`.
   - The final value of `start_year` will be the result of applying the formula iteratively for each element in `nums`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the exact `nums` list is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `start_year`.
   - However, we know that `start_year` will be the final value obtained after applying the formula iteratively for each element in `nums`.

Given this reasoning, the output will be the final value of `start_year` after the loop completes.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the final value obtained after applying the formula iteratively for each element in the nums list)**
