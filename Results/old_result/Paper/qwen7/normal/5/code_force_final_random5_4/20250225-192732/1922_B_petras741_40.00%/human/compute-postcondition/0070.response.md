Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from another input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` takes another input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list to the variable `w`. The initial values of `t`, `buffer`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
