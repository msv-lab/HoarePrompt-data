Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is a list containing two tuples `[('a3', [l3]), ('a3', l3)]`, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list containing integers, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is assigned the first integer from input, `*l3` is assigned the rest of the integers from input as a list.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to `l3` as a list. The other variables remain unchanged.
