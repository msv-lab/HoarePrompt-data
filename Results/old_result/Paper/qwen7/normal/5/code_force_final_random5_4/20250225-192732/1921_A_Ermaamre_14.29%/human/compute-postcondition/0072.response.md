Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is the first integer from the input split, `y2` is the second integer from the input split, `x3` is the first integer from the input split, `y3` is the second integer from the input split, `x4` is the third integer from the input split, `y4` is the fourth integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns them to `x4` and `y4`. The initial values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, and `y3` remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 2 also remains valid.
