Reasoning:
The given program aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program correctly reads the number of test cases, iterates over each test case, and processes the coordinates of the corners. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Storing Coordinates**: It stores the coordinates of the corners in a list called `coord`.
3. **Sorting Coordinates**: The coordinates are sorted to ensure they are in a consistent order.
4. **Calculating Distances**: The program calculates the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points. These distances should represent the side length of the square since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
5. **Calculating Area**: The area is calculated as the product of the square roots of these distances, which is correct for a square.
6. **Outputting Result**: The area is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the area of the square for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
