Postcondition: **`idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `val` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22` are set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. Since the if condition `m == 2` is not specified to change any of these variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
