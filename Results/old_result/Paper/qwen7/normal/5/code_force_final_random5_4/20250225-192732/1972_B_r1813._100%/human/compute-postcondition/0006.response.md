Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 2, `s` is now equal to `data[3]`**.

Explanation: The code `s = data[index + 1]` updates the value of `s` to be the element at index `index + 1` in the `data` list. Given that `index` is 2, `s` is updated to `data[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
