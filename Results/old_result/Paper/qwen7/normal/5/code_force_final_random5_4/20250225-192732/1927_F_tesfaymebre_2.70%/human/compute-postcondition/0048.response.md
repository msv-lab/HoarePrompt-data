Postcondition: `w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, the values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the union operation between `u` and `v` has been performed with weight `w`, and `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated accordingly.
