Output State: **`i` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B', and the last character of `inpstr` is 'B'.**

Explanation: The line `ind2 = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 0) to `ind2`. No other changes are made to the variables or conditions. Therefore, the value of `i` remains 0, `ind2` is also 0, and the conditions on `inpstr` remain unchanged.
