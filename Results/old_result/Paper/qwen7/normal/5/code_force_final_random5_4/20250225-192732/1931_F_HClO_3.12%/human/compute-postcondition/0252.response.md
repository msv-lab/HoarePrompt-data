Output State: **`idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `val` is an empty list; `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `t`, `a2`, `l11`, `a3` is an integer read from input; `l22` is a set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; the element `a1` is inserted into list `l1` at index `idx2`; the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the index `idx2`. This changes the state of `l1`, but does not affect the values of the other variables. The conditions involving `idx1`, `idx2`, and the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` remain unchanged.
