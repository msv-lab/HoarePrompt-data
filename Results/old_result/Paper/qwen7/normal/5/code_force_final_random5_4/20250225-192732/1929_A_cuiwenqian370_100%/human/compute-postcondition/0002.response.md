Output State: **`t` is now the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `results` is a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

The code `t = int(data[0])` assigns the integer value of `data[0]` to `t`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
