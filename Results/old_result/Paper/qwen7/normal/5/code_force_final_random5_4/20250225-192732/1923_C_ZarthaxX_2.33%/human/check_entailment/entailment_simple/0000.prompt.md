Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `i` is n+1, `ones[n]` is the sum of 1's in `nums` up to index n-1, `sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` minus the count of 1's in `nums`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n+1`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of 1's encountered so far in the `nums` list, with the last element being the total count of 1's in the entire list. The `sum` list will store the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums`, adjusted by subtracting the count of 1's, with the last element being the final adjusted sum.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `n+1`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of 1's encountered so far in the `nums` list, with the last element being the total count of 1's in the entire list. The `sum` list will store the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums`, adjusted by subtracting the count of 1's, with the last element being the final adjusted sum. Each iteration of the loop processes a query defined by `l` and `r`, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition involving `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`.
