Output State: **`leftMove` is 6, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged), `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged), `rightZero` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged), `rightOne` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged), `left` is `mid - 3`, `right` must be such that the condition `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` holds true, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2 + 1`, `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is decreased by 1.**

The variable `trightZero` is decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The conditions involving `right` and the other variables like `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain as specified in the initial state.
