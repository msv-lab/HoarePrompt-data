Output State: **The `colors` list is initialized to `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros), all nodes in the DSU structure are merged into connected components based on the edges processed, the `_min_edge` value remains the same, the `w`, `u`, and `v` variables reflect the last edge processed, and the `dsu` object shows the fully connected graph with all nodes merged into their respective components.**

In simpler terms, the `colors` list is now a list of zeros with a length of `n+1`. The DSU structure, which represents the connected components of the graph, remains unchanged from the previous state. The `_min_edge` value stays the same as it did after the third iteration. The `w`, `u`, and `v` variables still hold the values from the last edge processed. The `dsu` object reflects the fully connected graph where all nodes are part of the same connected component.
