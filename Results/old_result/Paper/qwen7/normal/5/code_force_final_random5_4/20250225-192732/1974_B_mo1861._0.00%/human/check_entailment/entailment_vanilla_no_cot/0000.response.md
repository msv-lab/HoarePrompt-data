Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to decode the string but contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the mapping in `char_map` is incorrect. The mapping should be between characters in the auxiliary string `r` and their corresponding symmetric characters in `b`, not the other way around.

Here's the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    
    # Create the character map for decoding
    char_map = {r[i]: r[~i] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Decode the string b
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

This corrected function properly creates the auxiliary string `r`, builds the correct character map for decoding, and then applies this map to decode the input string `b`.
