You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `greater_count` will hold the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and `same_value_count` will hold the total number of elements in list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`. The variable `value` will not be defined outside the loop as it is a temporary variable used within the loop. The variable `t` will be decremented by the total number of elements processed in all iterations, `n`, `f`, and `k` will remain unchanged. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition remains as is. Otherwise, if `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, `same_value_count` remains unchanged. If `greater_count + same_value_count` is greater than `k`, `same_value_count` is adjusted so that the total count of elements greater than `favorite_value` and those equal to `favorite_value` does not exceed `k`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`) retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes after sorting but still gets removed because there are cubes with higher values that get removed first. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  MAYBE
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this case, after sorting, the values are `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The favorite cube (value 3) is in the second position. Since `k = 2`, the first two cubes are removed, which includes the favorite cube. However, the program incorrectly outputs `YES` instead of `MAYBE`.

The program incorrectly assumes that if the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite value is less than `k`, and the total number of cubes with the same value as the favorite plus those with greater values is also less than or equal to `k`, then the favorite cube will definitely be removed. This assumption is not always true, as demonstrated by the above counterexample.
