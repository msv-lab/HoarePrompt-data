Postcondition: **`counter` is 3, `a` is the input string from the user, `no` is False, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the next character in the string `c`, `b` is the new input string from the user, if `x` is not found in both `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
