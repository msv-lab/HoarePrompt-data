Output State: **`i` is 2; `list[2]` is `list[2] - 2 * list[1] - 1` and must be greater than `2 * list[1] + 2`; `list[1]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is greater than 0; `list[2]` is now `list[2] - 2 * list[1]`; `list[i - 1]` is now `list[i - 1] - 1 * list[i - 1]` which simplifies to `list[i - 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` subtracts `list[i - 1]` from itself, resulting in `list[i - 1]` becoming 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Since `i` is 2, `list[i - 1]` refers to `list[1]`. Therefore, `list[1]` is updated to 0.
