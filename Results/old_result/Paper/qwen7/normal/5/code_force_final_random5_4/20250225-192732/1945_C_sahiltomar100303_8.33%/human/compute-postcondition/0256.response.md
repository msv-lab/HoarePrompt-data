Postcondition: **`left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus 1, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid` plus 1, `trightOne` is decreased by 1, and `tleftOne` is 1 if `left` is 0, otherwise `trightZero` is decreased by 1.**
