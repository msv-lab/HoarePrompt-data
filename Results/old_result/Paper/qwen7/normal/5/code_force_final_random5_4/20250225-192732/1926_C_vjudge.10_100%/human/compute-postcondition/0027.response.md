Output State: **`values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers; `sum_value_digits` is the sum of `int(x)`.**

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` updates the value of `sum_value_digits` by adding the integer value of `x` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `sum_value_digits` which is the sum of its previous value and `int(x)`.
