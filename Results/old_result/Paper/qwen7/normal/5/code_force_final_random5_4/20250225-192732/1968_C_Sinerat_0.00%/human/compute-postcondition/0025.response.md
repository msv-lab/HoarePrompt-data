Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The variable `n` must still be greater than or equal to its original value (since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, it will reach `n` when the loop ends). The list `a` will have been updated such that each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]` is the cumulative sum of `a[0]` and the corresponding elements from `x` up to `x[n-2]`.
