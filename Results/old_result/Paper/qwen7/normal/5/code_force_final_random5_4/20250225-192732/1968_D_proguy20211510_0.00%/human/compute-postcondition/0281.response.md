Output State: **`ptsb` now contains the new element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `ptss` now contains the new element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`. This new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, where `rem` is defined as `k - (i + 1)`. The values of `ptsb` and `rem` remain unchanged from their initial state.
