Output State: **`start` is increased by `inc` and is not equal to 0; `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`; `s` is increased by either 1 or the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, depending on whether `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or not; `d2[start]` is assigned the value of `s`.**

This means that the variable `d2[start]` now holds the value of `s`, while the other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
