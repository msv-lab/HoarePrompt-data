Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `q[j]` is an integer in the list `q`; if `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains the integer `j`. There is no change to `q[j]` or `eta` if the condition `q[j] > 0` is not met.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is defined outside the loop and does not change within the loop body.

5. **Update the State**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be the previous value of `j` plus 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The postcondition for the next iteration will be based on the new value of `j`.

Given that the previous value of `j` is such that the condition `q[j] > 0` was either met or not, the next value of `j` (which is `j + 1`) will be checked in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `j` and the unchanged value of `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`q[j]` is an integer in the list `q`; if `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains the integer `j`; `j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is the previous value of `j` + 1; `n` remains the same; there is no change to `q[j]` or `eta` if the condition `q[j] > 0` is not met.**

To be more precise, if the previous value of `j` was `k`, then the new value of `j` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`q[j]` is an integer in the list `q`; if `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains the integer `j`; `j` is now `k + 1`; `n` remains the same; there is no change to `q[j]` or `eta` if the condition `q[j] > 0` is not met.**
