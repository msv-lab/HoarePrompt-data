Output State: **`i` is 30; `j` is less than 32; `suf[j][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Initially, the value of `(cur >> j & 1)` is 0, which means `suf[j][0]` was 0 before the operation. After executing `suf[j][0] += 1`, the value of `suf[j][0]` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
