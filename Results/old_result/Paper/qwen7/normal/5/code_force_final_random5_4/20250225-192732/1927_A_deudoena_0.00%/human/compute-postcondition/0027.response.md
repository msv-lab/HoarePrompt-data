Postcondition: `i` is 0, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B', and either the last character of `inpstr` is 'B', in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no such condition since the else part does not change the variables.
