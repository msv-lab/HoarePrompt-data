### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given code.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum possible beauty of an array \(a\) by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - Sorts the array.
   - Computes the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   
2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads input from standard input.
   - Processes each test case by calling `func_1` on the array.
   - Prints the results.

#### Key Points:
- Sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences.
- To maximize the beauty, we should place the largest and smallest elements in positions that maximize the differences.

#### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach involves placing the largest element in the first position and the smallest element in the second position, followed by alternating the largest and smallest remaining elements.

#### Example:
For the input:
```
2
5
100 54 80 43 90
3
2 1 3
```

- **First Test Case**:
  - Optimal arrangement: `[100, 43, 80, 54, 90]`
  - Beauty: \((100 - 43) + (43 - 80) + (80 - 54) + (54 - 90) = 57\)

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Optimal arrangement: `[3, 1, 2]`
  - Beauty: \((3 - 1) + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0\)

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the current implementation does not handle all cases correctly.
- The provided example demonstrates that sorting the array does not always yield the maximum beauty.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
