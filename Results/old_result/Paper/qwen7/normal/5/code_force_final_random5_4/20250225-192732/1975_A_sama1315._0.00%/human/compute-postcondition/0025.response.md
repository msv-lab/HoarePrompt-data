Output State: **`index` is 9 + n + 2 * n, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index - n:index])`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index - n:index])**.

In this output state, the value of `index` remains unchanged as it was initially defined as `9 + n + 2 * n`. The variable `t` remains greater than 0. The `results` list still contains two additional elements, one of which is `result`, and the other is `arr`, which is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` within the range `index - n` to `index`. The variable `n` remains the integer value of `data[index - n]`. The `result` variable now holds the return value of the function `func_1(arr)`, and `arr` is updated to reflect the list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` within the specified range.
