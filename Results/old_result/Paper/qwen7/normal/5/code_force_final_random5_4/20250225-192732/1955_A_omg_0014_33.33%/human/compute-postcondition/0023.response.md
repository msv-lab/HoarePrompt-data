Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is equal to `c / 2`. If `a * b < a * d`, then no change occurs to the variables. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.**
