Output State: **`ans` is increased by `s[i]`, `i` is the `i` value of the next tuple in `d`, `j` is the `j` value of the next tuple in `d`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[i]` adds the value of `s[i]` to `ans`. Here, `i` refers to the `i` value of the next tuple in the list `d`, and `j` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
