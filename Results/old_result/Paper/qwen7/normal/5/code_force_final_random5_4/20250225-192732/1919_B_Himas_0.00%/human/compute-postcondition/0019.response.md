Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string that is two characters shorter, `q` is the last character processed from `e`, `P` is 1, `M` is 2 and `q` equals '+' if `P` was 2 and `M` was 0, otherwise `q` equals '-' if `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `P` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 (if previously) to 1. The values of `s`, `e`, `q`, `M`, and their conditions remain unchanged.
