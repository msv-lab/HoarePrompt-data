Output State: **`counter` is 2 if the last digit of `num` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 1; `i` is `len(num) - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. Given the initial state, if the last digit of `num` is '0', then `counter` starts as 1 and gets incremented to 2. If the last digit of `num` is not '0', then `counter` starts as 0 and gets incremented to 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
