Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is an integer entered by the user minus 3, `end` is now an integer entered by the user minus 2, `s` is 0, `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.**

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. Since `end` was initially `an integer entered by the user minus 1`, after executing the code, `end` becomes `an integer entered by the user minus 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
