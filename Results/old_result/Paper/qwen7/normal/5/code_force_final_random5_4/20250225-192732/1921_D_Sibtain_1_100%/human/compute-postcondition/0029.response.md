Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for k in range(len(a))`. The only variable here is `k`.

2. **Determine the current value of `k`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `k < len(a)`. Since `k` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `k` will be 1 if `len(a)` is greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to update `k` to 1 for the next iteration. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ans` is max(t1, t2), `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])**
