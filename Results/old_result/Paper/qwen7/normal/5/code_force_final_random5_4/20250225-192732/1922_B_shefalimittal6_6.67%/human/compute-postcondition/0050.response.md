Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is not yet defined**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by incrementing the count of `x` by 1. Since `x` is not yet defined, it is treated as a new key in the dictionary, and its initial count is set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
