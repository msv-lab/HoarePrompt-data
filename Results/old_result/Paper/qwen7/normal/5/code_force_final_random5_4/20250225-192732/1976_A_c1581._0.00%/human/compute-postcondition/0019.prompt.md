Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for char in password:
    if char.isdigit():
        digits.append(char)
    else:
        letters.append(char)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `char` is a character. If `char` is a digit, then `char` is added to the list `digits`. Otherwise, `char` is a non-digit character, and it is added to the list `letters`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `char` is the next character in the `password` string, `digits` is the list of digits, and `letters` is the list of non-digit characters. If `char` is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list, and `letters` remains unchanged. If `char` is not a digit, it is added to the `letters` list, and `digits` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `char` is the next character in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list, and `letters` remains unchanged. If `char` is not a digit, it is appended to the `letters` list, and `digits` remains the same list of digits.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
