Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 2`
- `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration
- If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

We need to determine the value of `a[i]` when the print statement executes. Since `i` is `n + 2`, we need to know the value of `a[n + 2]`.

Given that `a` is a list and `i` is set to `n + 2`, the print statement will access the element at index `n + 2` in the list `a`. Since no specific value for `a[n + 2]` is provided, we can only refer to it as `a[n + 2]`.

The print statement also uses `end=' '` to separate the two printed values with a space.

Output: **a[n + 2] a[n + 2]**
