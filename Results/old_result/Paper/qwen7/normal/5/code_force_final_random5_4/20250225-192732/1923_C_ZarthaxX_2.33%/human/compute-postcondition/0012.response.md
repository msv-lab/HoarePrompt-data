Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `i` is 7, `ones[7]` is `ones[6]` plus 1 if `nums[6]` equals 1, otherwise `ones[7]` is `ones[6]`, `sum[8]` is `sum[7] + nums[7] - 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `i` to `i-1`, so `i` becomes 7. It also updates `sum[8]` to `sum[7] + nums[7] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
