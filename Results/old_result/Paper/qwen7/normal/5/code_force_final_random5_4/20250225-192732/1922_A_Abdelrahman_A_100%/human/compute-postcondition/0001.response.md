State: **`tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0**.

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- For the loop to execute, the condition `tests > 0` must be true because the `range(tests)` function will generate numbers from 0 to `tests - 1`.
- Therefore, the initial state of `tests` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute, and `i` must be set to 0 as it is the starting value for the loop variable.
