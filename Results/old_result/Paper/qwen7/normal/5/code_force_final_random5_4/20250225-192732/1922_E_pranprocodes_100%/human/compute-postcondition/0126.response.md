Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 100000000, `x` is 1, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 repeated 50000000 times and 100000000 repeated 50000000 times.**

Explanation: The code `ans.reverse()` reverses the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains 100000000 repeated 50000000 times and -100000000 repeated 50000000 times in an alternating pattern. Reversing this list will change the order of the elements, so it will now contain -100000000 repeated 50000000 times followed by 100000000 repeated 50000000 times. The values of `i`, `t`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.
