Output State: **`res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, and `cnt` remains greater than or equal to 3**.

This means that the value of `res` has been updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its previous value, while `num_of_lens` and `cnt` remain as they were in the initial state, with `cnt` still being greater than or equal to 3.
