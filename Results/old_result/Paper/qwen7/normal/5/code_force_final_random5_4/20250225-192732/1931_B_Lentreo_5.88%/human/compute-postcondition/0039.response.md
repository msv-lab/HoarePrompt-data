Output State: **`curr` is updated to its previous value plus the difference between the current value of `i` and the last value of `i`. `i` is now the second element of `nums` and is not equal to 0. `nums` is the list without the first element.**

This means that `curr` has been updated by adding the difference between the current value of `i` (which is the second element of `nums`) and the last value of `i` (which is the first element of `nums` before the update). The value of `i` is now the second element of `nums`, and `nums` has been modified to exclude the first element. The value of `curr` reflects the updated sum based on these changes.
