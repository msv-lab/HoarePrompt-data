Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by defining a function `func_1()` that takes two integers \( n \) and \( m \) as input and prints 'Yes' if \( n \geq m \), otherwise it prints 'No'. However, the program incorrectly calls `func_1()` without passing any arguments in the loop. This means that `func_1()` is never actually called with the correct inputs from the input stream.

To fix this, the program should pass the values of \( n \) and \( m \) to `func_1()` within the loop. Here's the corrected version:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, m)
```

With this correction, `func_1()` will receive the correct values of \( n \) and \( m \) for each test case, and the program will work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
