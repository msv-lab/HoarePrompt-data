Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
