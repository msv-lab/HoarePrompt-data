Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is 1, `p2` is an integer, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `p1`. Since `p1` was previously an integer (with no specific value given), it is now explicitly set to `1`. All other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `p2`, `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
