Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, and `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input. Since the if condition `k >= n - 1` does not change the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
