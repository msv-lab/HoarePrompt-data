The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of strings), and three strings a, b, and c (each of length n). For each test case, it checks if the string c can be formed by concatenating substrings from strings a and b. If c can be formed, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
