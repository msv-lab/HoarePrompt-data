Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads `N` test cases but only processes one test case. It should read and process each test case individually.
2. **Function Call Location**: The function `func_1` is called within the loop that iterates from `0` to `n-1`, which is not necessary and incorrect. The problem requires summing the digits of each number from `1` to `n`, not from `0` to `n-1`.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The variable `soma` is initialized outside the outer loop, which means it will accumulate the sum across all test cases instead of being reset for each test case.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
