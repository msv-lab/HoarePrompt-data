Output State: **`num_of_lens` is processed as before, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `res`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged from their previous states.
