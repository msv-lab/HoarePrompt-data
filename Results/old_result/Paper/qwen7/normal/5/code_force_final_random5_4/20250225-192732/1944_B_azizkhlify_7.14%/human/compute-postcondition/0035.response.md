Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `l[a[1] - 1]` is equal to 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 1.
- Therefore, `a[i]` is `a[1]`.

We also know that `l[a[1] - 1]` is equal to 2. This implies that `a[1] - 1` is the index in the list `l` where the value 2 is located. However, this information about `l` is not directly needed to determine what is printed from the `print` statement itself.

The `print` statement will print the value of `a[1]` twice, separated by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Since `a[1]` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it must be such that `a[1] - 1` corresponds to an index in `l` where the value 2 is found.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 2**
