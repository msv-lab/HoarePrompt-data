Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is an input string, `P` is 0, `M` is 0, and `i` is `previous_i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the input to the variable `e`. The initial values of `s`, `P`, `M`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `s` remains an input integer, `e` now holds the input string, `P` is still 0, `M` is still 0, and `i` is `previous_i + 1`.
