Output State: **`res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`, and `res` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `res` has been updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its previous value. The values of `cnt` and `total_sum` remain as they were in the initial state, and `res` has been modified accordingly.
