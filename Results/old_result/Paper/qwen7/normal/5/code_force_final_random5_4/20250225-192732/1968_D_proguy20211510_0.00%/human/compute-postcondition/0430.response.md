Output State: **maxs is the maximum value of the cumulative sum of `pres` from index 3 to the last index plus the contribution of `rem` for each element in `s`; maxb is the maximum value of the cumulative sum of `preb` from index 1 to the last index plus the contribution of `rem` for each element in `b`.**

Explanation: The code `maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)` calculates the maximum value from the list `ptss` and assigns it to `maxs`, and the maximum value from the list `ptsb` and assigns it to `maxb`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `maxs` and `maxb` as described.
