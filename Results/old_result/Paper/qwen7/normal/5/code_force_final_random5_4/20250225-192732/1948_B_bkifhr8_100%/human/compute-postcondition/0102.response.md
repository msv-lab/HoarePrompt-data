Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is `False`
   - `i` is `m - 3`
   - `m` must be at least 3
   - `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `m - 1` down to `1` (since the step is `-1`).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than `0`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be decremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `arr[i - 1]` will be updated based on the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to `arr[i - 1]` unless specified otherwise.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 3`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than `0`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `m - 4` in the next iteration.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `m` and `arr[i - 1]` remain unchanged, only `i` needs adjustment.
   - `ans` remains `False` unless the loop body changes it, but since the loop body is omitted, `ans` stays `False`.

**Final State**:
- `ans` is `False`
- `i` is `m - 4`
- `m` must be at least 3
- `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`

**Answer**:
State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 4`, `m` must be at least 3, and `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`**
