Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. Specifically, the logic used to determine the next year for each sign is flawed. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

The program should calculate the years as follows:
1. First sign occurs in year 3.
2. Second sign occurs in year 4 (since year 3 has passed).
3. Third sign occurs in year 8 (since year 4 has passed).
4. Fourth sign occurs in year 10 (since year 8 has passed).
5. Fifth sign occurs in year 18 (since year 9 has passed).
6. Sixth sign occurs in year 36 (since year 18 has passed).

However, the program calculates the next year using a different approach:
- It uses `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to find the next occurrence of the sign, which does not correctly account for the sequential nature of the occurrences.

This formula does not ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. For instance, in the given example, the program might incorrectly calculate the year for the sixth sign, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should use a more straightforward approach to ensure each sign occurs sequentially. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        current_year = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_year += a[i]
            while current_year % a[i] != 0:
                current_year += 1
        results.append(str(current_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
```

This corrected version ensures that each sign occurs in the correct order and at the correct year.
