Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is an input string, `list1` is an empty list, `b` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
