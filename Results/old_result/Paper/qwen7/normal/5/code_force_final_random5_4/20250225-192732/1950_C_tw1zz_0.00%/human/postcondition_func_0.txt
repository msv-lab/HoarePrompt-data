The function processes multiple time inputs in 24-hour format and converts them to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. For each input, it prints the time in the format "h1:mm AM/PM", where `h1` is the adjusted hour, `mm` is the minute, and `AM/PM` is determined based on the adjusted hour. After processing all inputs, the function ensures that all time conversions are correctly displayed according to the 12-hour clock system.
