Output State: `i` is 7, `size` is 5, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 4` to `i = size - 1`, which means it will run a total of `size` times since `size` is 5. After 3 iterations, `i` becomes 5. Since the loop runs for a total of 5 iterations, after all iterations, `i` will be 7. The `size` remains unchanged at 5. Each iteration increments the element at index `-result - i - 1` by `result`. Therefore, after 5 iterations, the final value of `i` will be 7, and the specified element in `sequence` will have been incremented by `result` five times.
