Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is the length of `lst` minus 3, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is either the absolute value of the difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` or 1, depending on whether `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d2[start]` is `s`, and if `start + inc` is less than -1, `mini` remains 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` is 11111111.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` is `lst` length minus 4, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111` plus 1 or updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged, `d2[start]` is `s`, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` is `lst` length minus 4 plus `inc`, `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, and `d2[start]` is equal to `s`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
