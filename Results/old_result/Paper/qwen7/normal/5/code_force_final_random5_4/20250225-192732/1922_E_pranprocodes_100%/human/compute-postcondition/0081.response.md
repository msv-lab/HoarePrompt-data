Output State: `i` is 1, `t` is the total number of iterations, `x` is 1, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing alternating values starting from -100000000 and ending with -100000000.

Explanation: The loop continues to run as long as `x` is not equal to 1. Each iteration modifies `x`, `max`, `min`, and appends a value to `ans`. After each even division of `x`, `max` decreases by 1, and after each decrement of `x` (when it's odd), `min` increases by 1. The loop terminates when `x` becomes 1. Given the conditions, `max` will end up being -100000000 and `min` will be 100000000. The list `ans` will contain alternating values starting from -100000000 and ending with -100000000, with the exact sequence depending on the path taken through the loop (whether `x` was even or odd).
