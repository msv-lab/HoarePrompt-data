Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Since the initial state does not provide the exact value of `pre[j][0]`, we only know that it has been increased by 1. The values of `c` and `j` remain unchanged.
