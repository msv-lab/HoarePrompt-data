Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by pairs of positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5) such that the sum of all m values does not exceed 2⋅10^5. Additionally, for each pair (n, m), there are integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9) provided. The function returns results based on these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific ranges and values, and process them according to the given constraints, returning outputs relevant to each test case.
