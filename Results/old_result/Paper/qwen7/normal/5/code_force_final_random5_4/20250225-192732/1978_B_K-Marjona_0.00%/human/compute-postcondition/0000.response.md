Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer value. This means that the user must input a positive integer for the loop to continue.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the input from the user, the initial state before the loop should reflect that the user must provide a positive integer. The variable `t` (which represents the number of test cases) is not directly involved in the loop condition but rather in the context of the problem. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided by the user is a positive integer.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that the user must provide a positive integer.

**State:**
**`_` is a placeholder, input must be a positive integer**
