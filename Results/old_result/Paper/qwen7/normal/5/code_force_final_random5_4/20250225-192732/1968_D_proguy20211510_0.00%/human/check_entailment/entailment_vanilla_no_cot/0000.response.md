Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Permutation and Array Access:**
   - The code incorrectly handles the permutation and array access logic. Specifically, the way `pb` and `ps` are updated inside the loop is flawed. The indices should be adjusted properly when moving to `p[pb-1]` and `p[ps-1]`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The logic for determining the winner is overly simplistic and does not account for the full complexity of the game. It only checks if the maximum value in `a` is at the starting positions and fails to consider the optimal path for each player.

3. **Redundant and Unnecessary Code:**
   - The code includes unnecessary variables and logic, such as `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha`, which are not used in the solution and do not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The scores are calculated in a way that does not reflect the actual game rules. The scores should be calculated based on the sequence of moves and the values at those positions, not just the maximum value in `a`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one should simulate the moves for both players and calculate their scores based on the given rules. Here is a more accurate approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, pb, ps = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Initialize scores
        score_bodya = 0
        score_sasha = 0

        # Simulate the game for Bodya
        pos_bodya = pb - 1
        for _ in range(k):
            score_bodya += a[pos_bodya]
            pos_bodya = p[pos_bodya] - 1

        # Simulate the game for Sasha
        pos_sasha = ps - 1
        for _ in range(k):
            score_sasha += a[pos_sasha]
            pos_sasha = p[pos_sasha] - 1

        if score_bodya > score_sasha:
            print("Bodya")
        elif score_sasha > score_bodya:
            print("Sasha")
        else:
            print("Draw")

func()
```

This approach correctly simulates the game for both players and calculates their scores based on the given rules, ensuring the correct determination of the winner.
