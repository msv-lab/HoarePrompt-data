Output State: **`p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to be `mex - a[i]`. Here, `mex` is not defined in the initial state, and neither are `p` and `a`, but we know that `n` must still be greater than 0 as no operation affects its value. The value of `p[i]` is now dependent on the values of `mex` and `a[i]`.
