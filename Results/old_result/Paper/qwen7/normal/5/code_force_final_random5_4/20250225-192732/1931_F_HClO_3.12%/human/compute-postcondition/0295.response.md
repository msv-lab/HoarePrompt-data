Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of `a3` and `l3` from each iteration, and `t` must be greater than 1.**

The `input()` function is called without any arguments, which means it will wait for user input. However, since no specific assignment or modification to existing variables is performed, the values of `n`, `m`, `val`, and `t` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 is also preserved.
