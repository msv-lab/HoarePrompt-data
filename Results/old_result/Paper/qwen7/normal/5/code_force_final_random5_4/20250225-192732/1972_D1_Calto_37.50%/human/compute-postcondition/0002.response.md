Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `x` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `x = n - (1 * 1 - 1)`, which further simplifies to `x = n - 0`, resulting in `x = n`. Since `n` is not specified, it remains as `n`. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged.
