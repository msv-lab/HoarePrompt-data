Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `mid` to `n-1`. The loop condition is `i < n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `mid + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`.
   - If `s[i]` equals '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 2.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `mid + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `mid + 2`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be `mid + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `mid + 2`.

6. **Consider the Loop Body Effects**:
   - The loop body updates `rightZero` and `rightOne` based on the value of `s[i]`.
   - However, these updates do not affect the loop condition or the values of `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 2`**.
