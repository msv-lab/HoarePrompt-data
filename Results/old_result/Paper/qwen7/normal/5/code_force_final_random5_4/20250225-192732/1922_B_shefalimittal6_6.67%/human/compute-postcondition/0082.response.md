Output State: **`num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the current `cnt`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Here, `total_sum` remains unchanged as it is not being recalculated. `cnt` also remains unchanged as it is not being modified within the given code snippet. `num_of_lens` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on its keys or values. Therefore, the only change is in `res`, which now includes the additional value calculated from `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.
