Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The key insight is that the maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array and then pairing the largest element with the smallest, the second largest with the second smallest, and so on. This way, the positive differences will be maximized while minimizing the negative differences.

Let's analyze the provided program:

1. It reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array elements (`a`).
3. It sorts the array `a`.
4. It initializes `kq` to 0.
5. It iterates over the first half of the sorted array, calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements and adding these differences to `kq`.

This approach is correct because:
- Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are paired optimally.
- By iterating only through the first half of the sorted array, it correctly calculates the sum of the required differences.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
