Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of `a3` and `l3` from each iteration, and `t` must be greater than 1.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, the variables `n`, `m`, `val`, and `t` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values or add new information to the state.
