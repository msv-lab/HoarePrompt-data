Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game or compute the MEX of the array `c` as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Game Logic Misunderstanding**: 
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then remove it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it without appending.
   - The provided code does not simulate these rules accurately. It sorts the array and then tries to place elements into a dictionary, which doesn't reflect the game's turn-based nature.

2. **MEX Calculation Error**:
   - The MEX of an array `c` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `c`.
   - The current implementation does not properly track the elements picked by Alice and Bob to form the final array `c` and calculate its MEX.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The provided logic does not consider the optimal strategies for both players to achieve their goals.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game according to the rules and ensure that we compute the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Alice picks first, so she will pick the smallest available unique numbers
        # Bob will pick the next smallest available numbers
        alice_turn = True
        mex = 0
        picked = set()

        for num in a:
            if alice_turn:
                # Alice picks the smallest number that hasn't been picked yet
                while mex in picked:
                    mex += 1
                picked.add(mex)
                mex += 1
            else:
                # Bob picks the smallest number available
                while num in picked:
                    num -= 1
                picked.add(num)

            alice_turn = not alice_turn

        # The MEX is the smallest number not in the picked set
        while mex in picked:
            mex += 1
        print(mex)

# Example usage:
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice and Bob follow the rules of the game and computes the MEX of the final array `c` correctly.
