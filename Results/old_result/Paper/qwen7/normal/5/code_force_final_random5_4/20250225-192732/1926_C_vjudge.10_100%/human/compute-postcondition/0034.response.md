Output State: **`values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers; `sum_value_digits` is the total sum of `int(x)` for every character `x` in the string `i`.**

This means that after executing the line of code `values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, the value of `values[i]` has been updated to include the sum of the numeric values of all characters in the string `i` (converted to integers), and `sum_value_digits` now holds the cumulative sum of the integer values of each character in the string `i`.
