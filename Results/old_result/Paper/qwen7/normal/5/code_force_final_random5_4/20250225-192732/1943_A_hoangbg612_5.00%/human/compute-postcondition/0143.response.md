Output State: **`cur` is either 3 or 0, `i` is 2, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given the initial conditions:

- If `cur` is equal to the next `num` in `N` and `i` is 2, then `cur` was already set to the next `num` in `N` (let's call this value `next_num`) and `i` is 2. After incrementing, `cur` becomes `next_num + 1`, which is 3.
- If `cur` is -1 and `i` is 0, then `cur` becomes -1 + 1, which is 0.

The values of `i` and `M` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as described.
