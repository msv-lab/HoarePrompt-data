Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even to determine the winner, which is incorrect. According to the rules, the player who cannot make a valid move loses. If both players play optimally, the player whose number of coins is smaller will lose because they will eventually run out of coins to remove.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 1`

According to the game rules:
1. Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 1 coin.
2. Alice cannot swap wallets since she would end up with 0 coins, which is not allowed.
3. Bob also cannot swap wallets since he would end up with 0 coins.
4. Both players are forced to remove a coin from their wallets.
5. After removing a coin, Alice has 0 coins and Bob has 0 coins.
6. Alice cannot make a move and thus loses.

However, the program incorrectly prints "Bob" as the winner for this case. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
