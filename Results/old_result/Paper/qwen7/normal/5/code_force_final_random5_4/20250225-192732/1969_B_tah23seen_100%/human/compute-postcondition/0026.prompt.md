Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000; `cost` is 0; `one` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '1':
        one += 1
    elif i == '0' and one > 0:
        cost += one + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the first character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is '1', then `one` is set to 2. If the first character of `s` is '0' and there exists at least one '1' in the string `s`, then `cost` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the value of `cost` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty binary string with its first character removed, `i` is the second character of `s`, `one` is either 2 or 3, `cost` is either increased by 2 or increased by `one + 1` if `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `one` and `cost` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty binary string with its first two characters removed, `i` is the third character of `s`, `one` is either 2, 3, or 4, and `cost` is increased by 2 if `i` is '1', increased by `one + 1` if `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, and remains unchanged otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
