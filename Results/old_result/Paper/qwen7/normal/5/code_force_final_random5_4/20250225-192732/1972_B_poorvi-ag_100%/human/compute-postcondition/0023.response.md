Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the new string input by the user, `results` is a list with 'no' appended, `i` is `i + 1`**.

This means that the `results` list now contains 'no' appended to its previous contents, and `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions or the changes specified in the initial state.
