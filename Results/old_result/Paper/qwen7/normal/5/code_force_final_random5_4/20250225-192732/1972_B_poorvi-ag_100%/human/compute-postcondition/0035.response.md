Output State: **The final output state will be a list named `results` that contains 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration from 0 to `t-1`. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and `i` will also be 0.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `results` will contain 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd or even, for a total of `t` such evaluations. The variable `t` will be 0, and `i` will be 0.
