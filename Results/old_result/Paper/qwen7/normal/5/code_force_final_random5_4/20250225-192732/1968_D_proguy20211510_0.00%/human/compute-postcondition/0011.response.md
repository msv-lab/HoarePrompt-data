Output: **Draw**

Explanation: The print statement `print('Draw')` directly outputs the string 'Draw'. According to the initial state, no specific values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` are required to determine the output of this print statement. The only relevant detail is the string itself, which is explicitly printed as 'Draw'.
