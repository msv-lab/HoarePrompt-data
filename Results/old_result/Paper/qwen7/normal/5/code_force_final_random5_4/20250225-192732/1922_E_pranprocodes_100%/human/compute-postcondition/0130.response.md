Output State: `i` is 999999, `t` is 100000000, `x` is 1, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 repeated 50000000 times and 100000000 repeated 50000000 times.

Explanation: Given the constraints, the maximum value of `x` can be \(10^{18}\). In the worst-case scenario, which is when `x` is always odd, the loop will run until `x` reaches 1. This requires \(100000000\) iterations because the loop increments `min` and decrements `x` by 1 in each iteration, effectively halving the range of values between `max` and `min` each time. Since `t` is incremented in each iteration, it will reach `100000000` after `999999` inputs (as the loop starts from `i=0`). At the end of the loop, `x` will be 1, `max` will be -100000000, `min` will be 100000000, and `ans` will contain `-100000000` repeated 50000000 times followed by 100000000 repeated 50000000 times, as the list `ans` is reversed at the end.
