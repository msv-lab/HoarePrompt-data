Output State: **`rightZero` retains its initial value, `trightZero` retains its initial value, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, `trightOne` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, and `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `mid`.**

This means that the variable `leftOne` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables (`rightZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `mid`, and `i`) retain their initial values. The condition for `i` remains the same, i.e., `i` is `i + 1` and must still be less than `mid`.
