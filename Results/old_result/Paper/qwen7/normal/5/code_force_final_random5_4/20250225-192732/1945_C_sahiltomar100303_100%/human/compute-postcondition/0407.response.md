Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced by 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `left` is now `mid - 1`, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and `rightZero` is increased by 1; either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must hold true for the next iteration.**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions involving `leftZero`, `left`, `mid`, `rightOne`, and the comparison with `n` remain valid as per the initial state.
