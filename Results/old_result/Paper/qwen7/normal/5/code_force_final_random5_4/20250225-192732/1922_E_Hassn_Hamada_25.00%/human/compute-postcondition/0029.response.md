Output State: `i` is 7, `size` is 5, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i` starting at 4 up to `size` which is 5. Therefore, the loop will run 6 times in total (from 4 to 9 inclusive). After 3 iterations, `i` is 5. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after all 6 iterations, `i` will be 7. The condition inside the loop modifies the `sequence` array based on the current value of `i` and `result`. Given that the modification happens in every iteration and the loop runs 6 times, the final value of `i` will be 7, and the specified element in `sequence` will be incremented by `result` 6 times.
