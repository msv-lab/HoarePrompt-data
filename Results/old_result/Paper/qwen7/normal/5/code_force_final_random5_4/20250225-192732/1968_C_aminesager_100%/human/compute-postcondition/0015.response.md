Output State: `a` is a list starting with the integer 1000, followed by `n-1` elements where each element is calculated as the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element from the list `T` (excluding the first element of `T`). The value of `n` is greater than 1, and `i` equals `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `a` will start with 1000 and then contain `n-1` elements. Each of these elements is the cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of the list `T`, where each element in `a` is derived from the previous one by adding the corresponding element from `T`. The variable `n` remains greater than 1, and the variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes.
