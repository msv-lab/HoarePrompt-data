Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over each character `ch` in the string `password`. Therefore, the loop head involves the variable `ch`.

2. **Determine the postconditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `password` is a non-empty string of length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)).
   - `letters` is a list containing the character `ch` if `ch` does not represent a digit.
   - `digits` is a list containing the character `ch` if `ch` represents a digit.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has processed one character from `password`.
   - The next character `ch` will be the next character in `password`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `password`, the length of `password` remains the same.
   - The variable `letters` will now include the new character `ch` if it is not a digit.
   - The variable `digits` will now include the new character `ch` if it is a digit.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `password` remains a non-empty string of length \(n\).
   - `letters` includes the new character `ch` if it is not a digit.
   - `digits` includes the new character `ch` if it is a digit.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length \(n\), `letters` is a list containing the characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing the characters from `password` that are digits**.
