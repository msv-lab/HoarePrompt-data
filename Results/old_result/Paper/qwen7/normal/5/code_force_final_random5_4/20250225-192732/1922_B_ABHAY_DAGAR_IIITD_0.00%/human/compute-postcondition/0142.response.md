Output State: **`total_count` remains 0, `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is equal to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value.**

Explanation: 
- The initial state is that `total_count` remains 0, `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `res` is set to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.
- The code snippet updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value. Since `total_count` is 0, the term `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` evaluates to 0, which means `res` does not change.
- Therefore, the value of `res` remains as per the initial condition: it is equal to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.
