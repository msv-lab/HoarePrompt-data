Output State: **`i` is 5, `x` is an integer value equal to `a[5] % 10`, `y` is `a[5] // 10`, `c` is a list containing the value of `y`.**

The code `c.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `c`. Since `y` is `a[5] // 10`, the list `c` now contains this value. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
