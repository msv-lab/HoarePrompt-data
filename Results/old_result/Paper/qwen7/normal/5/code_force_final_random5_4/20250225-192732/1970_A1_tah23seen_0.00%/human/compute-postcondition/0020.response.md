Output State: The final state of the loop will have `i` equal to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of the string `s`), `d[n]` will be the maximum depth of nested parentheses in the string `s`. The array `d` will contain `n+1` elements, with each element representing the depth of the string up to that index. If the `i`-th character in `s` is '(', then `d[i+1]` will be one more than `d[i]`; otherwise, it will be one less than `d[i]`. The variable `ans` will remain an empty string as it is not affected by the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the last index of the string `s`, `d` will show the depth of the deepest nested parentheses at each position in the string, and `ans` will still be an empty string.
