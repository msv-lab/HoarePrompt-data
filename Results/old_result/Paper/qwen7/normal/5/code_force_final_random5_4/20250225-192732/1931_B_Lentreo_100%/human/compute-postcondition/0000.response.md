Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums', `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(nums)` calculates the length of the list `nums` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The sum of the integers in `nums` remains divisible by `n`, and the nature of `nums` as a list of integers representing amounts of water in each container is preserved.
