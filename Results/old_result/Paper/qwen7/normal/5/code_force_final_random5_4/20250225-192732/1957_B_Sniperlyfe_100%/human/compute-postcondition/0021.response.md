Output State: **After the loop completes, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `nums` contains `n` elements where the first element `nums[0]` is `(1 << (`k`.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and each subsequent element `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is `0` since `k` is non-positive.**

Explanation: The code `nums[0] += k` updates the first element of the `nums` list by adding the current value of `k` to it. Since `k` is already less than or equal to 0 after the loop, adding `k` to `nums[0]` will simply make `nums[0]` equal to `(1 << (`k`.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` if `k` was positive, or remain the same if `k` was already non-positive. After this operation, the loop ends, and `i` becomes `n`, indicating all elements in `nums` have been processed. Each subsequent element in `nums` is set to `0` because `k` cannot be decremented further.
