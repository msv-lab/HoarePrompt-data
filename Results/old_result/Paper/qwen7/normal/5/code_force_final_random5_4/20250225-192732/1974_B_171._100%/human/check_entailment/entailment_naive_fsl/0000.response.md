Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the encoded string `b` is empty. In such a scenario, the program will attempt to process the string and call `func_1`, but since `b` is empty, the logic inside `func_1` will not execute properly. Specifically, the lines:

```python
unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
char_map = {}
len_unique = len(unique_chars)
```

will raise an error because `encoded` is an empty string, and operations like `set(encoded)` and `sorted(set(encoded))` are not defined for an empty string. This means the program will fail to decode an empty encoded string, which violates the problem description.

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of `func_1` to handle the case where the encoded string is empty:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    if not encoded:
        return ""
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
    decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))
    return decoded
```

With this modification, the program should handle both non-empty and empty encoded strings correctly.
