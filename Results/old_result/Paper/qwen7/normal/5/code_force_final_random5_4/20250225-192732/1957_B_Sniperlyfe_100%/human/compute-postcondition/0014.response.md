Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `k` is updated to `k - min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.

3. **Loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `3`.
   - The value of `k` is updated based on the condition `k - min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, but this update does not depend on the loop variable `i`. Therefore, the value of `k` remains the same unless explicitly updated within the loop body.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `i` will be `3` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `k` remains unchanged from its previous value (since no further information about the loop body is provided).

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `k` is updated to `k - min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**.
