Output State: **`cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`, and `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`. This is done using a generator expression within the `sum()` function. The values of `cnt` and `total_sum` are updated based on this calculation, while `res` remains unchanged as no operation affecting it is performed.
