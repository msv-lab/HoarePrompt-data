Reasoning:

1. The annotated program reads the input correctly and calls the `func_1` function for each test case.
2. The function `func_1` is intended to find the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal using at most one operation.
3. The function starts by finding the last index `i` where the array has consecutive duplicates starting from the beginning. This ensures that all elements from index 0 to `i-1` are the same.
4. Then, it finds the first index `j` where the array has consecutive duplicates ending from the end. This ensures that all elements from index `j` to the end are the same.
5. If the entire array is already uniform (i.e., `arr[0] == arr[-1]`), the function returns the maximum of `j - i - 1` and 0. Since `i` is the length of the array and `j` is 0, this simplifies to 0 because `j - i - 1` would be negative.
6. Otherwise, the function returns the maximum of the minimum cost to make the array uniform either by changing the prefix or the suffix, which is calculated as `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

Given the logic and the steps described, the function appears to correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal using at most one operation. The provided examples also match the expected outputs.

Correctness: **True**
