Output State: **`cur` is the next element in the list `N`, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value 2.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Initially, `M[cur]` was set to 1. After executing `M[cur] += 1`, the value of `M[cur]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
