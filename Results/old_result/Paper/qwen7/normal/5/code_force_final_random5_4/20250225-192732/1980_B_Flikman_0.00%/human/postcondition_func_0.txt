The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \), along with a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it determines whether there are at least \( k \) elements in the list \( a \) that are either greater than the \( f \)-th element or equal to it. If the number of such elements is at least \( k \), it prints 'YES'. If the number of such elements is less than \( k \), it prints 'NO'. In all other cases, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
