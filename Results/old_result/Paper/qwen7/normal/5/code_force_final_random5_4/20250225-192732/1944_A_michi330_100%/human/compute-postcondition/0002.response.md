Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and splits them into two variables `n` and `k`. It then converts these inputs to integers using the `int` function. The precondition that `t` must be at least 1 remains unchanged, while `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input.
