### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Iterating Over Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to check if the password meets the criteria:
     - It separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
     - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter.
   - However, there is a subtle issue in the iteration logic to check for digits coming after letters. The current implementation uses `password[i].isalpha()` and `password[i + 1].isdigit()` to check for an alphabetic character followed by a digit. This approach will fail when the password ends with a digit, as there will be no `i + 1` index to check.

3. **Checking for Digits After Letters:**
   - The current implementation of the check for digits after letters is:
     ```python
     for i in range(len(password) - 1):
         if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
             return 'NO'
     ```
   - This check will miss the case where the password ends with a digit. For example, the password `"011679"` would pass this check even though it is invalid because there is no character after the last digit.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To fix this, the check should be modified to:
     ```python
     for i in range(len(password) - 1):
         if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
             return 'NO'
     if password[-1].isdigit():  # Check if the last character is a digit
         return 'NO'
     ```

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - With the above modification, the function will correctly identify invalid passwords like `"011679"`.
   - The rest of the function logic is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the password ends with a digit. The provided program is incorrect due to this oversight.
