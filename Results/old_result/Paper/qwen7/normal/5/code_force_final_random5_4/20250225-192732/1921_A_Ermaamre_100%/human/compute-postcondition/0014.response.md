Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is a list of 4 lists where each list contains integers entered by the user, `x` is a list of the first elements from each of the 4 lists in `a`, `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `dx` as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. The new value of `dx` is determined by finding the maximum and minimum values in `x` and subtracting the minimum from the maximum.
