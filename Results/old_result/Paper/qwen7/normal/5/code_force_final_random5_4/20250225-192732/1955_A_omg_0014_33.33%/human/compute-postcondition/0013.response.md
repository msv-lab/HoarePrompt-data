Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `d` is equal to `c / 2`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the respective integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and splits them by spaces, assigning them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial states.
