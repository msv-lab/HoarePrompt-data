Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 6.
   - `n` must be greater than 6.
   - `l[a[6] - 1]` is equal to 2.
   - `ul` is 2.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 6, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 7 (the next value in the range).
   - `n` must still be greater than 6 for the loop to continue.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `l[a[6] - 1]` being equal to 2 and `ul` being 2 are not directly affected by the loop itself and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 7, `n` must be greater than 6**.
