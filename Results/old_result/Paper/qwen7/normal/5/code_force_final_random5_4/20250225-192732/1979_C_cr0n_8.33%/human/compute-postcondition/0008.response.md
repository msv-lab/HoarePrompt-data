Output State: **`prod` is `prod * r`, `r` is the next element in `vals`, `vals` is the list without its first element, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 50\); `prod` is updated to `prod * r`**.

Explanation: The code `prod *= r` multiplies the current value of `prod` by the next element `r` in the list `vals`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The updated value of `prod` is now `prod * r`.
