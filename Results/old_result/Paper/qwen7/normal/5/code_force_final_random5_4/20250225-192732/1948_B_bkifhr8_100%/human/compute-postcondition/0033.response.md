Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`, `i` is `i - 1`, and `m` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be the first element of the list `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
