Postcondition: `last_digit_index` is either 0 or -1, `password` is a string with at least one character, `i` is 3, `char` is the fourth character in the password. If `last_digit_index` is not -1, the function returns 'NO'. If `last_digit_index` is -1, the function does not return anything (or the state remains unchanged).
