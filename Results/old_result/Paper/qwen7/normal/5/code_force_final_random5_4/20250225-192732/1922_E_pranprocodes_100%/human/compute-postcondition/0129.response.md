Output State: `i` is 999999, `t` is 100000000, `x` is 1, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 repeated 50000000 times and 100000000 repeated 50000000 times.

Explanation: Given the constraints, the maximum value of `i` (which is derived from `input()`) is 999999 because `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). When the loop runs its final iteration with `i` being 999999, it will still follow the same logic as described for the previous iterations. Since the loop continues until `x` becomes 1, and given the constraints on `x`, the total number of iterations `t` will be 100000000. At this point, `max` will be -100000000 and `min` will be 100000000, with `ans` being a list containing -100000000 repeated 50000000 times followed by 100000000 repeated 50000000 times, as per the pattern observed in the previous states.
