Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: 
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts (as per the `range(a)` syntax).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: 
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < a`.
   - Therefore, `a` must be a positive integer and `i` must start at 0.

4. **Check the Given States**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This value does not directly affect the loop's execution.
   - `num` is a positive integer. This value does not directly affect the loop's execution.
   - `out` is an empty list. This value does not directly affect the loop's execution.
   - `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the string `b`. This value does not directly affect the loop's execution.
   - `a` is an integer, and `b` is an input string from the user. We need to ensure `a` is a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the only variables that need adjustment for the loop to execute are `i` and `a`.

- `i` should start at 0.
- `a` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `a` must be a positive integer**
