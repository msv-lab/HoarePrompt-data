Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is '10', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is '10', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM', and `h` is equal to '10'.**

The code simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`, or the original value of `h`.
