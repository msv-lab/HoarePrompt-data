Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.
- `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces.
- The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.

The code snippet provided is simply:

```python
print('-1')
```

This `print` statement will output the string `-1` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`.

Output: **-1**
