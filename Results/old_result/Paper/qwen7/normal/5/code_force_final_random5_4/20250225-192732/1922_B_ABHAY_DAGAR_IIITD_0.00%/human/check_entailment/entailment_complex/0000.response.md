Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle, which means the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick. However, the provided code does not implement this logic. Instead, it incorrectly calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect cube and the number of ways to choose two sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect square. This is evident from the formulas used in the code:

1. `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` - This formula is used to count combinations of three sticks where each stick has the same exponent, which is not relevant to forming a triangle.
2. `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` - This formula is used to count combinations involving pairs of sticks with the same exponent, again unrelated to forming a triangle.

Given the problem's requirements, the correct approach would involve checking the triangle inequality for each combination of three sticks.

Correctness: **False**
