The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 50) followed by \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (0 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 99). For each test case, it checks if the sequence can be made non-decreasing by swapping adjacent elements only once. If such a swap is possible, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return a value but prints the result for each test case.
