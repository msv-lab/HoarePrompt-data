Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, `cnt1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `cnt1` is 1, `cnt1` remains 1. If `cnt1` is 2 or more, `cnt1` is either greater than 2 or odd if '11' is a substring of `s`, or `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or even if '11' is not a substring of `s`.
