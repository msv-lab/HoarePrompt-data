Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program ensures each condition is met:

1. **Sorting of Letters**: The program collects all letters into a list and checks if this list is sorted using `sorted(letters)`. This ensures that all letters in the password are in non-decreasing alphabetical order.

2. **Sorting of Digits**: Similarly, the program collects all digits into a list and checks if this list is sorted using `sorted(digits)`. This ensures that all digits in the password are in non-decreasing numerical order.

3. **No Digit After Letter**: The program iterates through the password and checks if any alphabetic character is immediately followed by a digit. If such a sequence is found, it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it proceeds to check the next condition.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the password might contain only letters or only digits, which are considered strong according to the problem statement.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program behaves as expected and correctly identifies whether a password is strong or not based on the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
