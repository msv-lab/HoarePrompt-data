Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The solution provided uses a recursive approach to construct this array.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will have a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The base case is when `number` is 0, in which case it returns 0.
   - The function calculates the size of the sequence needed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - It then populates the sequence with integers from 0 to 4 and recursively constructs the sequence.
   - The modifications to the sequence ensure that the resulting array meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Recursive Construction**:
   - The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)` is used to construct the sequence.
   - The modifications to the sequence (`sequence[-result - i - 1] += result`) are crucial to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches the target `X`.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The main loop reads the test cases and calls `func_1` to generate the sequence.
   - The length of the sequence is printed first, followed by the sequence itself.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the required number of increasing subsequences cannot be achieved by returning `-1`.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code seems to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
