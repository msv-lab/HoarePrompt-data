Output State: `i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('4', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('x', 'y'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is 0, `res` is 0, `n` is 1.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., when `i` reaches 4), `i` will be 4, and the list `coord` will contain four tuples of coordinates provided by the user. The other variables (`p2`, `res`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
