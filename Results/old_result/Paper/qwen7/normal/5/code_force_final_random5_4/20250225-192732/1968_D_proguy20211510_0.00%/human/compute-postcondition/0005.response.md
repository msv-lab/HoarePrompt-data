Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer**.

Explanation: The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are strings. The code snippet converts `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` to integers. Since `n` was already an integer, it remains unchanged. However, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers as well. The output state reflects these changes while maintaining the range constraint for `n`.
