Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `size` is `i + 3`, and `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head involves the variables `size` and `i`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) <= number`.

3. **Current States:**
   - `size` is `i + 3`.
   - `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`.

4. **Determine Next Iteration Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) <= number` must hold true.
   - Substitute `size = i + 3` into the loop condition:
     \[
     (1 << (i + 3 + 1)) - (1 << i) = (1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     (1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i) = 16 \cdot (1 << i) - (1 << i) = 15 \cdot (1 << i)
     \]
   - Therefore, the loop condition becomes:
     \[
     15 \cdot (1 << i) <= number
     \]

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, the condition `15 \cdot (1 << i) <= number` must hold true.
   - Since `i` is the only variable that can change within the loop head, we need to ensure that `i` is such that the condition holds true.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be adjusted such that `15 \cdot (1 << i) <= number`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` must be set such that \(15 \cdot (1 << i) <= number\), `size` is `i + 3`, and `value` is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\)**.
