Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `mid`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < mid`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - Postcondition: If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < mid`, and `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `mid`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.

5. **Determine the new value of `mid`**:
   - The value of `mid` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body. It is still `n // 2`.

6. **Adjust the postcondition**:
   - The postcondition will depend on the value of `s[i]` when `i` is 2.
   - If `s[2]` is '0', then `leftZero` will be 2.
   - If `s[2]` is '1', then `leftOne` will be 2.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, if `s[2]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2**.
