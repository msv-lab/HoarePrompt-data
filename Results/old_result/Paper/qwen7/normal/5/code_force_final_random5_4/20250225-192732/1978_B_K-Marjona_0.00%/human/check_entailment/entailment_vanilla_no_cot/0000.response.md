Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotional conditions. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

2. **Determining \( k \)**: 
   - \( k \) is calculated as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that \( k \) is the minimum between the number of buns and the difference between the special price and the usual price.
   - If \( b \leq a \), it means there is no benefit in applying the promotion, so the program directly calculates the profit as \( n \times a \).
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit using the formula:
     - The sum of the arithmetic series for the first \( k \) buns sold at the modified prices: \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 \times k\).
     - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program correctly handles all scenarios, including edge cases where \( b \leq a \). Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
