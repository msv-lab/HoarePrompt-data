Output State: **`low` is `mid`, `high` is `n`, `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing the value `(0 + n) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `low = mid` updates the value of `low` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `low` is now `(0 + n) // 2`, while `high` remains `n`, `mid` remains `(0 + n) // 2`, `pos` remains 3, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` remains the result of the function `func_2()` call, `i` remains n, and `st` remains a set containing the value `(0 + n) // 2`.
