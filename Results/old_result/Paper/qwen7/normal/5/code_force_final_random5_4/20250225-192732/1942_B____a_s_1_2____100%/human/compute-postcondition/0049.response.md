Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `n` will remain unchanged. For each index `i` from `n-1` down to `0`, `p[i]` will be set to `mex - a[i]` and `mex` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This process ensures that `p` is filled with values based on the initial conditions and the operations performed within the loop.
