Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (exclusive), meaning `i` should start from `1` and go up to `n-1`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is initially set to `n`, the loop cannot start as `i` is not less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - To allow the loop to execute, `i` must be set to `1` (the starting value of the loop) and `n` must be greater than `1` (so that `i < n`).

6. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - The initial values of `a` and `x` do not affect the loop's ability to start, as they are not used in the loop head.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
