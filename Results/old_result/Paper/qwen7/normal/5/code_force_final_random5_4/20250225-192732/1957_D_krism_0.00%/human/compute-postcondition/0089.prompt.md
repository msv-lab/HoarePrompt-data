Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is 32; `pre[i][0]` is 32.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations (32 times), the variable `i` will be 32, and each sublist in the `pre` list will have its first element set to 32.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    cur = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if cur >> j & 1:
            suf[j][1] += 1
        else:
            suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 32, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[32]`, `j` is 31, `suf` is an array where each element `suf[j]` is a list containing two integers. For each `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is the count of 1s encountered so far at that bit position, and `suf[j][0]` is the count of 0s encountered so far at that bit position. If the bit at position `j` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is the count of 0s encountered so far at that bit position, and `suf[j][1]` is the count of 1s encountered so far at that bit position.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all 32 iterations, `suf` will contain the counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position from 0 to 31 in the binary representation of `cur`. The variable `j` will be 31 since the loop iterates from 0 to 31.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 31, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 31, `suf` is an array where each element `suf[j]` is a list containing two integers. After the loop has executed all 32 iterations, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` will contain the count of positions `k` (where `0 <= k <= 31`) such that the bit at position `k` in `cur` is 1, and `suf[j][0]` will contain the count of positions `k` (where `0 <= k <= 31`) such that the bit at position `k` in `cur` is 0.

This means that after the loop completes, `suf[j][1]` will represent the number of 1-bits in the binary representation of `cur` up to and including the `j`-th bit, and `suf[j][0]` will represent the number of 0-bits in the same range.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 30, `j` is 31, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range.

This means that after the loop has executed all 32 iterations (from `j = 0` to `j = 31`), the variable `j` will be 31. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` will hold the number of 1s in the bits from position `j` to 31 in the binary representation of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` will hold the number of 0s in the same range.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
