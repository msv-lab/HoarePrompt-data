### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given examples.

#### Problem Description:
- The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts, where the cost of one yogurt is `a` burles and the cost of two yogurts is `b` burles.
- The program should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates either \(a \times b\) or \(round(a \times \frac{c}{2})\).
- It prints the result for each test case.

#### Analysis:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `d`:**
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is the price for one yogurt if two yogurts are bought at the promotion price.
   - This calculation is incorrect because `c` is not the price for one yogurt; it is the price for two yogurts.

2. **Comparison Logic:**
   - The logic compares `a * b` (regular price for one yogurt) with `a * d` (promotion price for one yogurt).
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`, otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the example where `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`.
     - The correct minimum cost is 15 burles (buying three yogurts for 15 burles).
     - The program calculates `d = 11 / 2 = 5.5` and then checks if `5 * 5 < 5 * 5.5`, which is false. Thus, it prints `round(5 * 5.5) = 28`, which is incorrect.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves:
     - Buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
     - Handling the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`:
     - Buy 1 pair of yogurts for 11 burles.
     - Buy 1 yogurt at the regular price for 5 burles.
     - Total cost = 11 + 5 = 16 burles (which rounds to 15).

#### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given promotion. The logic used in the program is flawed and does not always yield the minimum cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
