Postcondition: `no` is False, `tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0; `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from user, `c` is an input string. The current value of `c` is either equal to `a` or equal to `b`, or after the loop has executed all its iterations, `c` is an input string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations the loop executed (which is the length of `c`), `x` is the last character in the string `c`, `counter` is equal to the length of `c` + 1, and `x` is not in `a[counter-1]` and `x` is not in `b[counter-1]`, causing us to break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
