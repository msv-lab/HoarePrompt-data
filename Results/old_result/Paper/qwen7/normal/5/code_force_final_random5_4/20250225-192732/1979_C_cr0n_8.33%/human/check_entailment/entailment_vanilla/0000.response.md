Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Each outcome has a multiplier \(k_i\), and the winnings for the \(i\)-th outcome would be \(x_i \cdot k_i\), where \(x_i\) is the amount bet on the \(i\)-th outcome.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - It then computes the value `vprod`, which is the product of all multipliers divided by each individual multiplier.
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` because no valid distribution of coins is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic of calculating `vprod` as `prod // r` for each \(r\) in `vals` is incorrect. This approach does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.
   - Instead, we need to find a way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome. One valid approach is to bet a small fixed amount (e.g., 1 coin) on each outcome and check if the condition holds.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We should bet 1 coin on each outcome and check if the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome.
   - If the condition holds, print the amounts; otherwise, print `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
