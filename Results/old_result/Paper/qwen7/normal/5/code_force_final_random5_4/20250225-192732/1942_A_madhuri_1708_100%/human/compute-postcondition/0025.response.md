Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is the integer value of the first split element from the input string `s`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second split element from the input string `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*[k for j in range(k)])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression `[k for j in range(k)]` generates a list with `k` elements, where each element is `k`.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack this list into separate arguments for the `print` function.
   - Therefore, the `print` function will print `k` occurrences of `k` separated by spaces.

Given the initial state, we know that `k` is the integer value of the second split element from the input string `s`. So, the output will consist of `k` occurrences of `k`.

**Output:** **k k ... k (k times)**
