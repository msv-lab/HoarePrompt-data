Postcondition: `pos` is increased by 2, and either `z_r` is decreased by 1 or `o_r` is decreased by 1 depending on whether `i` equals 0 or not. Additionally, if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true, then `ans` is set to `pos` and `b_d` remains as the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.
