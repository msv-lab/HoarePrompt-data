Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `match_a_b` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `match_a_b` remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
