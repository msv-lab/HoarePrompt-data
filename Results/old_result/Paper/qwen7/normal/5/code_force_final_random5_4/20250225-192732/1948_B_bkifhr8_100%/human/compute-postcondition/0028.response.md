Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, `ans` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `nums` is sorted, `i` is `i - 1`, and `m` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `nums` by converting each character of the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` into integers and appending the element `arr[i]`. This means that `nums` now contains the integer values of the characters in `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer value of `arr[i]`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
