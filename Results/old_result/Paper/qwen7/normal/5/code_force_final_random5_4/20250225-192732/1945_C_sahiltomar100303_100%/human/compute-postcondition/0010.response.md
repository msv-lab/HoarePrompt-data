Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `trightZero = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `trightZero`. The value of `rightZero` remains unchanged at 0. All other variables (`rightOne`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`) retain their initial values from the initial state.
