Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 4**

Explanation: The variable `index` was initially set to 2. The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2, resulting in `index` being 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
