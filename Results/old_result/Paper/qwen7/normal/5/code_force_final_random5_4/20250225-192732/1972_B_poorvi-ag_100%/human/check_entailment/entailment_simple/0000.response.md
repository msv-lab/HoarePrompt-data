Reasoning:

1. The problem statement describes a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The game ends when no more facing-up coins are available, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
2. The provided solution checks if the number of 'U' (up-facing) coins in the initial configuration is odd. If it is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
3. This logic is based on the observation that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of up-facing coins determines the winner. If the number of up-facing coins is odd, Alice can always force a win by playing optimally. If it is even, Bob can always force a win by playing optimally.
4. The provided code correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U' characters in the input string and checking if this count is odd or even.
5. The code iterates over each test case, counts the number of 'U' characters, appends 'yes' or 'no' to the `results` list based on the parity of the count, and then prints the results.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
