Postcondition: **`cur` is either -1 or equal to `num` if `num > cur`. If `cur` was -1, it is now updated to `next_num`. If `cur` was equal to `num`, it remains unchanged. `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, and `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was updated, or the key `next_num` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 and updated.**
