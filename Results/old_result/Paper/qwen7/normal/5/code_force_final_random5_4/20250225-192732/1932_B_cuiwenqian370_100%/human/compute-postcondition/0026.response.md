Output State: **`index` is incremented by 2; `n` is assigned the value of `data[index-1]`.**

Explanation: Initially, `index` is incremented by 1, and `n` is assigned the value of `data[index]`. After that, the code `index += 1` is executed, which increments `index` by 1 again. So, `index` is now incremented by 2 in total. The value of `n` remains the same as it was initially assigned before the second increment of `index`. Therefore, `n` is still assigned the value of `data[index-1]`, where `index-1` refers to the position that `n` was originally assigned to.
