Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is either `True` or `False`, `row2[j]` is `'>', `results` is either `['YES']` or `['NO']`, `test_case` is the next element in `test_cases`, and `n` and `row1` are assigned from `test_case`.**

Explanation: The variable `reachable_first_row` is explicitly set to `True`. The values of the other variables (`reachable_second_row`, `row2[j]`, `results`, `test_case`, `n`, and `row1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
