Let's analyze the loop condition step by step:

The loop condition is:
```python
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2):
```

We need to ensure that both conditions in the `and` statement are met for the loop to execute at least once.

1. **Condition 1:** `left > 0`
   - The current state of `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations.
   - For this condition to be true, `left` must be greater than 0. Since `n // 2` is always non-negative, the only thing that can affect `left` is the "total number of iterations" which has been decreased by `t`.

2. **Condition 2:** `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`
   - We need to check if either of these sub-conditions is true.
     - **Sub-condition A:** `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2`
       - `leftZero` is twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1`.
       - `(left + 1) // 2` is half of `left + 1` rounded down.
       - For this sub-condition to be true, `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1`.
     - **Sub-condition B:** `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`
       - `rightOne` is twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1`.
       - `(n - left + 1) // 2` is half of `n - left + 1` rounded down.
       - For this sub-condition to be true, `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`.

Given the current state:
- `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations.
- `leftZero` and `rightOne` are unchanged from their initial values.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to make sure that either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` holds true.

Since `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations, and `leftZero` and `rightOne` are unchanged, the only way to satisfy the loop condition is to ensure that `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`.

However, without knowing the exact values of `leftZero` and `rightOne`, we cannot directly adjust them. But we can ensure that `left` is positive and the loop condition is met by adjusting `left` itself.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `left` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations and must be greater than 0**
