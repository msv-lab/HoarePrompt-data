Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` must be 0, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, `start` plus 1 is less than the length of `lst`, and `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**
