### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the annotated code and the provided problem description.

1. **Function `func_1()`**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into a map object of integers. The map object is then converted to a tuple of integers `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list of integers `arr`.

3. **Function `func_3()`**: This function takes the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `k` as inputs. It also initializes the permutation array `arr` using `func_2()`. The function then finds the position of `k` in `arr` and performs a binary search to find the correct position for `k` if it is not already in the correct position.

   - **Finding Position of `k`**: The function iterates through the array to find the position of `k` and stores it in `pos`.
   
   - **Binary Search**: The function performs a binary search to find the correct position for `k` if it is not already in the correct position. The binary search is implemented using the variables `low` and `high`. The middle index `mid` is calculated, and depending on the value of `arr[mid]` relative to `k`, the `low` and `high` indices are updated.
   
   - **Output**: If `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed. Otherwise, it prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` indicating the indices to swap.

Now, let's consider the problem statement and the expected behavior:

- The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation such that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.
- The program should ensure that after the binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.

However, the provided program does not explicitly handle the case where the target value `k` is not present in the permutation `arr`. The binary search is performed to find the correct position for `k`, but the program does not check if the target value `x` is actually present in the permutation. If `x` is not present, the program will still output `1` and the indices to swap, which may not necessarily place `x` at the correct position `l`.

Given the specific case provided in the original assessment:
- Input:
  ```
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  The target value `3` is not present in the permutation, so the program should output `2` operations and the pairs of indices to swap. For example:
  ```
  2
  1 4
  4 5
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program outputs `1` and `1 4`, which is incorrect because it does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Since the program does not handle the case where the target value is not present in the permutation, it is not correct according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the required functionality, specifically in handling the case where the target value `k` is not present in the permutation `arr`.
