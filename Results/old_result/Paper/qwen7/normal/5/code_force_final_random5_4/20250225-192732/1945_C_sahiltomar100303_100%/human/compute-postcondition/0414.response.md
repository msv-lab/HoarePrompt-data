Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced by 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `left` is now `mid - 2`, `mid` must be greater than 2, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and `rightZero` is 1 more than its previous value.**

Explanation: The code increments `rightZero` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `rightZero` is updated to be 1 more than its previous value, while `leftZero`, `leftMove`, `left`, `mid`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` retain their original conditions and values.
