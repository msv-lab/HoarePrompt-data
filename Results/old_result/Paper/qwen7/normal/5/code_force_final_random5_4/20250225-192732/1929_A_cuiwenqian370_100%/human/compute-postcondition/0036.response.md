Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0, `results` will be a list containing the outputs of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, `index` will point to the position right after the last processed data, `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the corresponding slice of `data`, and `data` must be a list containing integers. The final state of `t` will be 0, as it is decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0. `results` will contain the outputs of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, and `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the corresponding slice of `data`. `index` will be increased by `1 + t*n` after all iterations, where `t` is the initial value of `data[0]` converted to an integer, and `n` is the sum of `n` values specified in `data` for each iteration.
