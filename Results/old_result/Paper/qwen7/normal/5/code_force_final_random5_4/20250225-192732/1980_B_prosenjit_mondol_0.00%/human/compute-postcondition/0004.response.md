Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer decreased by 1, `k` is an input integer decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the result in the list `a`. The variables `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
