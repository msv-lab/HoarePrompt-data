Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is the integer input of the user, `s` is the string input of the user, `mid` is the floor division of `n` by 2, `leftZero` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `leftZero` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, or `mid`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
