### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Digits**: For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: It then checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle all peak conditions.
5. **Equal Digits Condition**: If both the stair and peak conditions are not met, it checks if all digits are equal (`a == b == c`) and prints 'NONE'.
6. **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NONE'.

### Analysis of Peak Condition:
- The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is incorrect for determining a peak. A peak should satisfy `a < b > c`, which means `b` must be greater than both `a` and `c`.
- The current logic incorrectly flags any case where `b` is the maximum as a peak, even if `a` is not less than `b` or `c` is not less than `b`.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `3 4 1`, the program incorrectly prints 'PEAK' because `max(3, 4, 1) == 4`, but it should print 'PEAK' only if `3 < 4 > 1`.
- For the input `4 1 7`, the program incorrectly prints 'NONE' because `max(4, 1, 7) == 7`, but it should print 'STAIR' because `4 < 7 > 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for identifying peaks.

### Correctness:
**False**
