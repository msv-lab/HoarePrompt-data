Output State: **`i` is 1; `d[i + 1]` is `d[2]` and its value is `d[1] - 1`**.

Initially, `i` is 1 and `len(s)` is `n`. After executing the line `d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1`, the value of `i` remains unchanged, so `i` is still 1. The dictionary `d` is updated such that the key `i + 1` (which is 2) now points to the value `d[i] - 1` (which is `d[1] - 1`). All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
