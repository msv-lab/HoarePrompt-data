Postcondition: **`a` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are as per the input. `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`. If `y1 < y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. If `x1 != x3` or `x2 != x4`, then if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1 < y2`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, if `x1 == x4` and `x2 == x3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.**
