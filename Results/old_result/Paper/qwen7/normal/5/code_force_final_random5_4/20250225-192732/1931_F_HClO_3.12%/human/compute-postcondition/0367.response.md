Output State: **`idx1` is `i + 1`, `idx2` is `i`, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. The value of `idx1` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `i + 1`. The condition `if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not affected by this assignment, so it still holds the same meaning as before.
