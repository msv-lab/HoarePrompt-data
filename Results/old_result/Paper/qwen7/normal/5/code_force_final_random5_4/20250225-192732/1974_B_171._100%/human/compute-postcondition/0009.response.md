Output State: `i` is equal to `len_unique`; `len_unique` must be greater than 0; for every key `k` in `char_map`, `char_map[k]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `len_unique`. The dictionary `char_map` will map each character in `unique_chars` to its corresponding character from the end of the list, such that `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` is `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]` for all valid indices `j`.
