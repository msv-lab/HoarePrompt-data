Output State: **`ans` is increased by `x // 3`.**

The code `ans += x // 3` increments the value of `ans` by the integer division of `x` by 3. Since the initial value of `ans` and `x` is not specified, we can only say that `ans` has been updated to its current value plus the integer division of `x` by 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
