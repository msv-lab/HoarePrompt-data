Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test_case in `test_cases` is a list where the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and the second and third elements are strings consisting of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>', `n` is the first element of the current `test_case`, and `row1` and `row2` are the second and third elements of the current `test_case`.**

Explanation: The code unpacks the `test_case` tuple into two variables: `n` and a tuple containing `row1` and `row2`. This means that `n` now holds the first element of the `test_case` list, which is an integer between 2 and 2⋅10^5 (inclusive) and is even. Similarly, `row1` and `row2` now hold the second and third elements of the `test_case` list, which are strings of length `n` consisting only of '<' and '>' characters. The values of `results` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
