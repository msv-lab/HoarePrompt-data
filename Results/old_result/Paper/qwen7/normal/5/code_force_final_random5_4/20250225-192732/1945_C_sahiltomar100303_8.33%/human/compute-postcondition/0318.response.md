Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 2, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` (which was referred to as `leftZero` in the output) is incremented by 1. Initially, `leftZero` is 1, so after executing `tleftZero += 1`, `leftZero` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
