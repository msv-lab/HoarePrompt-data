Reasoning:

The given program has two distinct parts: the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function and the `func_1` function. The annotated program only calls `func_1`, which suggests that the original intention was to run `func_1` instead of `generate_files_for_html_in_range`.

However, the provided code for `func_1` does not match the problem description at all. The problem description asks for a function that processes folders and generates files based on certain conditions, whereas `func_1` is a completely different function that reads input from stdin and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on some conditions related to the count of '1's in a string.

Given this mismatch, the provided program is not correct for the problem statement. The function `func_1` should not be called instead of `generate_files_for_html_in_range`.

Correctness: **False**
