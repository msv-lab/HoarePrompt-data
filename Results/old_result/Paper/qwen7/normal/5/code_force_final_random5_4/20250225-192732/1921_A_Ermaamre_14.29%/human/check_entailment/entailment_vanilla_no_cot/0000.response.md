Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic in the program assumes that the given points form a square based on the x-coordinates being equal in certain pairs, which is not sufficient to determine the square's sides. Instead, it should calculate the distances between all pairs of points to identify the side length of the square.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x1, y1) = map(int, input().split())
        (x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
        (x3, y3) = map(int, input().split())
        (x4, y4) = map(int, input().split())

        # Calculate all possible distances between points
        distances = [
            ((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2),
            ((x1 - x3) ** 2 + (y1 - y3) ** 2),
            ((x1 - x4) ** 2 + (y1 - y4) ** 2),
            ((x2 - x3) ** 2 + (y2 - y3) ** 2),
            ((x2 - x4) ** 2 + (y2 - y4) ** 2),
            ((x3 - x4) ** 2 + (y3 - y4) ** 2)
        ]

        # Identify the smallest distance as the side length squared
        side_length_squared = min(distances)

        print(side_length_squared)
```

This corrected version calculates the squared distances between all pairs of points and identifies the smallest distance as the side length squared of the square.
