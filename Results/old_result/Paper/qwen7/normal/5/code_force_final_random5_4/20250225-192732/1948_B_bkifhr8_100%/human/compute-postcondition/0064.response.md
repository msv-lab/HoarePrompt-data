Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` remains `True`
   - `i` is `0`
   - `m` must be greater than `1`
   - `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   The loop runs from `i = m - 1` down to `i = 1` (since `i` starts at `m - 1` and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0).

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `nums` becomes `[nums[0]] + [nums[0]]`.
   - Otherwise, no change occurs in `nums`.

4. **Current Iteration**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `0`.
   - Therefore, the current value of `i` in the loop is `m - 1`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is now `m - 1`, we need to check if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]` (which is `nums[0]`).
   - If `arr[m - 1]` is less than `nums[0]`, then `nums` will become `[nums[0]] + [nums[0]]`.
   - Otherwise, `nums` remains unchanged.

6. **New State**:
   - `ans` remains `True` because the condition for `ans` to change is not specified in the loop.
   - `i` is now `m - 1`.
   - `m` must still be greater than `1`.
   - `arr[i - 1]` is now `arr[m - 2]`, which is `nums[0]`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than 1, and `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`**.
