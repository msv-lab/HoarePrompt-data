Output State: **`a` is a list of `n-1` integers each between 1 and 100, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, with the count of the integer `x` (the next element in the list `a`) increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1` increases the count of the integer `x` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. Since `x` is the next element in the list `a`, the count of `x` in the dictionary `cnt` is incremented by 1. All other elements in the list `a` and their counts in the dictionary `cnt` remain unchanged.
