Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 2 and must be less than `n`, `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Since `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 2 and must be less than `n`, and `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are updated based on the value at `s[right]`, the only variable that changes is `tleftOne`. Therefore, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, while `s`, `right`, `tleftZero`, and the condition on `right` remain unchanged.
