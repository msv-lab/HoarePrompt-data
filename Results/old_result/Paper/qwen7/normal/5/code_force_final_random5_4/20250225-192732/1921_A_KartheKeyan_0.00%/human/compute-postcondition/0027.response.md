Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `p2` is 0, `res` is 0, `n` is 1, `i` must be less than 4**

The code `coord.append((x, y))` adds a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are input integers, the list `coord` now contains one element, which is the tuple `(x, y)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
