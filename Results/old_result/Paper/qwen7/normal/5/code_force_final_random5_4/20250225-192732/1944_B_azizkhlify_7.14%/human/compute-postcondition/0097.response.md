Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**: The initial state provided is that `ul` is not equal to `ur`. However, these variables are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to print each element in `res` until `res` is empty. This information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop head variables but is important for understanding the loop behavior.

4. **Adjust the State of the Loop Head Variables**:
   - `i`: The variable `i` starts from `n` and increments by 1 until it reaches `2 * n`. Therefore, `i` should be initialized to `n`.
   - `n`: The value of `n` determines the range of the loop. It should be a positive integer to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be a positive integer**
