Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 0, `x` is an input integer but must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` (which is 100000000) to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` now contains the single element 100000000.
