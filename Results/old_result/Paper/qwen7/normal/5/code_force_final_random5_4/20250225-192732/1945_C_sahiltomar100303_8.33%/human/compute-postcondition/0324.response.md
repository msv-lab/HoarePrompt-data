Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `mid` is `n // 2`
   - Postcondition: If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.

4. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < mid`.
   - Since `mid` is `n // 2`, the loop will continue as long as `i < n // 2`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `mid` remains unchanged as it is determined by `n` and does not change within the loop.

6. **Postconditions**:
   - The postcondition for `leftZero` and `leftOne` will depend on the value of `s[1]` (since `i` is now 1).
   - However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `s[1]`, we cannot determine the exact values of `leftZero` and `leftOne` without additional information. But we know they will be set based on the value of `s[1]`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is `n // 2`**
