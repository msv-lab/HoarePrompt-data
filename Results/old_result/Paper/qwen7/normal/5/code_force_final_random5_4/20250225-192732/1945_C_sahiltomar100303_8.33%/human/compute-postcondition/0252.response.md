Output State: **`left` is 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus 1, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid` plus 1, and `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`.**

Explanation: The line `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Since `tleftZero` was initially either 0 or 1, after incrementing, its value becomes 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was 1), but we represent it as "either 0 or 1" since the exact value isn't specified in the initial state and only the increment operation is performed. All other variables remain unchanged.
