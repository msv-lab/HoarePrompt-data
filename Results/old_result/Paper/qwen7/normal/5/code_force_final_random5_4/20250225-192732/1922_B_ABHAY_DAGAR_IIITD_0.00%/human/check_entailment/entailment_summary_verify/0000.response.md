### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
- A non-degenerate triangle has a positive area, which means the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.

#### Given Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
- For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks.
- It then counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary `num_of_lens`.
- The program calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks based on the occurrences of each stick length without checking the triangle inequality theorem.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect cube and the number of ways to choose two sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect square. However, the provided summary is incorrect for this specific problem.

#### Correct Approach:
- To solve the problem correctly, we need to check the triangle inequality theorem for each combination of three sticks.
- The program should iterate through all possible combinations of three sticks and count those that satisfy the triangle inequality.

#### Original Assessment Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not check the triangle inequality theorem.
- The example provided in the original assessment is also correct. For the input:
  ```
  3
  3
  0 1 1
  ```
  The program incorrectly outputs `3` because it counts all combinations of sticks based on their occurrences, including invalid ones like `(2^0, 2^1, 2^1)` which forms a degenerate triangle.

#### Conclusion:
The given program is indeed incorrect because it does not check the triangle inequality theorem, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
