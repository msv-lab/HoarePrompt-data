Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `end` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s2` to the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial values of `start` and `end` are both "the integer entered by the user - 2", `s2` is now the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.
