The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `l` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return a value but prints the result for each test case.
