Output State: **`j` is 0, `c` is `prefix[32]`, `k` is 5, `y` is `arr[32]`, `ans` is updated by adding `pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0]`, `c` remains `prefix[32]`, `i` is now 34, and `suf[j][1]` is now 0.**

Explanation: The code decrements `suf[j][1]` by 1. Initially, `suf[j][1]` was equal to 1 (as stated in the initial state). After decrementing it by 1, `suf[j][1]` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
