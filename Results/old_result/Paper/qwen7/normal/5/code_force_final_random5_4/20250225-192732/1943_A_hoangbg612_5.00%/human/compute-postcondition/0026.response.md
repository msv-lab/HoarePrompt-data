Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` updates the dictionary `M` by setting the value of the key `cur` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
