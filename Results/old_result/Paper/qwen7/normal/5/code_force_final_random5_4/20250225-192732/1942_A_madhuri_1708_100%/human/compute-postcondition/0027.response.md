Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer value of the first split element from the input string `s`, `k` is the integer value of the second split element from the input string `s`. Since the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
