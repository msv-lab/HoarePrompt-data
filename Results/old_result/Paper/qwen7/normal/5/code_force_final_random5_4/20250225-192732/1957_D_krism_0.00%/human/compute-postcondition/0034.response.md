Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`. The variable `i` is not part of the loop head since it is not being modified within the loop.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 32
   - `n` is 32
   - `cur` is `prefix[32]`
   - `j` is 0
   - If the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, then `suf[0][1]` is 1. Otherwise, `suf[0][0]` is 1.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and the loop condition is `j < n`, the next value of `j` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` remains 32 (unchanged)
   - `n` remains 32 (unchanged)
   - `cur` remains `prefix[32]` (unchanged)
   - `j` changes to 1

6. **Post-Condition for the Bit Check**:
   - For `j = 1`, check if the bit at position `1` in `cur` is 1. If it is 1, then `suf[0][1]` is 1; otherwise, `suf[0][0]` is 1.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 32, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[32]`, `j` is 1**.
