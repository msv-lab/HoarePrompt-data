Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `list[3]` is decreased by 2 times `list[2]` minus 1.
   - `list[3]` is greater than 1.
   - `list[2]` is greater than 0.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `list[i]` must be greater than 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `i` is 3, so `list[i]` is `list[3]`.
   - `list[3]` is greater than 1.
   - `list[i - 1]` is `list[2]`, and it is given that `list[2]` is greater than 0.
   - `list[i + 1]` is `list[4]`, and we don't have information about `list[4]`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `list[3]` is already greater than 1 and `list[2]` is already greater than 0, no adjustments are needed for these conditions.
   - We need to ensure that `list[4]` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `list[4]` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3; `list[3]` is decreased by 2 times `list[2]` minus 1; `list[3]` is greater than 1; `list[2]` is greater than 0; `list[4]` must be greater than 0**
