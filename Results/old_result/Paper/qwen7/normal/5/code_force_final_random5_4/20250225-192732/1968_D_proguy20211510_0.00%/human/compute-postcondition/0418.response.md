Output State: **`i` is 1; `rem` is `k - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initially set to 0. The code updates `i` by incrementing it by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The variable `rem` is calculated as `k - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 1`. All other variables (`ptsb`, `ptss`, `ss`, `sb`, `preb`, `pres`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
