Output State: **`u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is `a + f`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 1`, `u` is updated with the first input integer, `v` is updated with the second input integer, `f` is updated with the third input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a += f` increments the value of `a` by the value of `f`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which includes being updated with the respective inputs.
