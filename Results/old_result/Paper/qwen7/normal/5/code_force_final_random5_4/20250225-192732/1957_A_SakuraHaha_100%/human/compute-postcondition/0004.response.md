Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in a:`. The objects involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, assigning each element to `x` in turn.

3. **Determine the initial state of `x` and `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100.
   - `x` will take on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration of the loop.

4. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 100.
   - `cnt` is an empty dictionary.

5. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `a`, the state of `a` must be known. Specifically, `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `x` will take on the values from the list `a` during each iteration, but its initial value before the loop starts is not specified and does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of the list `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 100, where `n` is at least 1**
