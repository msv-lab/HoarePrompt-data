Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `p2` is `x - y`, `res` is 0**.

The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The values of `i`, `p2`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `x` and `y` retain their initial input values, `coord` now contains the tuple `(x, y)`, `p2` remains `x - y`, and `res` stays at 0.
