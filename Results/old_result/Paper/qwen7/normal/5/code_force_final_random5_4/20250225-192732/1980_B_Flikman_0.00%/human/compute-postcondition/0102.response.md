Output State: **`t` is decreased by 2, `n`, `f`, and `k` are the first three integers from the input split into a list, `a` is a list containing these integers.**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `t` is decreased by 1. The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. Since `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values of the first three integers from the input, they are also updated. The value of `t` is further decreased by 1 due to the assignment operation.
