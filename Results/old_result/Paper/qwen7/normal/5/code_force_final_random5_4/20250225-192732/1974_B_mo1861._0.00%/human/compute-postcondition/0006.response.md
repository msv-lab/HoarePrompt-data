Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`.

   - `i`: This variable represents the index of the current element in the enumerated sequence.
   - `c`: This variable represents the current element in the sorted set of `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` must contain at least one unique character.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `c` is the first unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
   - `char_map[c]` is assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in `sorted(set(b))`.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increases with each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `sorted(set(b))`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `c` will be the next unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
   - `char_map[c]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was 0, so it will be incremented to 1.
   - `c` will be the second unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
   - `char_map[c]` will be assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 1 - 1))`, which simplifies to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 2))`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`b` must contain at least one unique character, `i` is 1, `c` is the second unique character in the sorted form of `b`, `char_map[c]` is assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 2))**.
