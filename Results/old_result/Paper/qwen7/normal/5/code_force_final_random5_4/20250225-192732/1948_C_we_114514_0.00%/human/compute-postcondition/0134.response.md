Output State: **`reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` remains True if `row1[j] == '>'` and `False` if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, otherwise `reachable_first_row` remains False.**

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. The conditions for `reachable_first_row` remain unchanged because they depend on the values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`, which are not modified by the given code.
