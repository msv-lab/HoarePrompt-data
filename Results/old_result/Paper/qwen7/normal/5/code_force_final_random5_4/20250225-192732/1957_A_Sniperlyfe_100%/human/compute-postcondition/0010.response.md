Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available (n), and the subsequent elements are the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.**

This means the function takes a list `arr` as input, where the first element indicates the number of sticks, and the rest of the elements represent the lengths of those sticks. It then calculates a frequency dictionary `freq` based on these stick lengths and returns the sum of each value in `freq` divided by 3 using integer division.
