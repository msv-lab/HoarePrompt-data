Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the array `a` according to the problem description. Specifically, the program generates `a` such that `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`, which does not necessarily satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The program will generate:
```
1000 1002 1006
```
However, this does not satisfy the condition:
- `2 = 1002 \bmod 1000` is false.
- `4 = 1006 \bmod 1002` is false.

A correct solution would involve generating `a` such that each `a_i` is chosen to satisfy the modulo condition. For instance, a correct approach could be to set `a_1` to a large value and then iteratively choose each subsequent `a_i` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`.
