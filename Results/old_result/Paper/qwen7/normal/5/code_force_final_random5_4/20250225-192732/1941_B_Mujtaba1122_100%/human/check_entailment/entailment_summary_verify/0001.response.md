### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero after performing the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the described operations and checks if it's possible to make all elements zero.
- However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the operations being performed. Specifically, the operation `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` and `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]` might lead to incorrect results because the value of `list[i-1]` is being reduced by itself, which could lead to negative values or incorrect adjustments.
- Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros due to the initial configuration of the array. For example, consider the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. The operations might not be able to reduce this array to all zeros due to the initial values and the constraints of the operations.

### Example Counter-Case:
Consider the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`:
- Initial array: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
- Applying the operation at `i=2`: `[2, 3, 3, 3, 1]`
- Applying the operation at `i=3`: `[2, 3, 2, 2, 1]`
- Applying the operation at `i=2`: `[2, 2, 1, 2, 1]`
- Applying the operation at `i=3`: `[2, 2, 0, 1, 1]`
- Applying the operation at `i=2`: `[2, 1, 0, 1, 1]`
- Applying the operation at `i=3`: `[2, 1, 0, 0, 1]`
- Applying the operation at `i=2`: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 1]`

At this point, the array cannot be reduced further because the operation cannot be applied to `i=2` again without making `list[1]` negative. Therefore, the function will incorrectly print 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero. There are cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros due to the constraints of the operations.

### Final:
**False**
