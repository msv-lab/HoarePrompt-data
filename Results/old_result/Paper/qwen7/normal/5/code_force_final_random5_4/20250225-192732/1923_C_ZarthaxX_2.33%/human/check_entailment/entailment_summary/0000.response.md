Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly handles the input for each test case, including the size of the array (`n`), the number of queries (`q`), and the array itself (`nums`). It also initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, which store the cumulative counts of 1's and the adjusted sums (subtracting 1 from each element).

2. **Cumulative Arrays Calculation**: The `ones` array stores the cumulative count of 1's up to each index, and the `sum` array stores the adjusted cumulative sum (each element minus 1) up to each index. This is used to efficiently compute the count of 1's and the sum of elements in any subarray.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates the count of 1's and the sum of elements in the specified subarray using the precomputed cumulative arrays. It then checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{count of 1's in the subarray} + (\text{length of subarray}) - \text{count of 1's in the subarray} \leq \text{sum of elements in the subarray}\) is satisfied. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray consists of a single element (i.e., `l == r`), printing 'NO' in such cases.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program logic appears to be correct. It efficiently uses precomputed cumulative arrays to check the conditions for each subarray in constant time after the initial preprocessing step.

Correctness: **True**
