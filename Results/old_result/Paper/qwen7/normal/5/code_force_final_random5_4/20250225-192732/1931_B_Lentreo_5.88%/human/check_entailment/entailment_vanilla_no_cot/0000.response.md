Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the current implementation is flawed and does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if the average amount of water per container is an integer. If the total amount of water divided by the number of containers (`n`) results in an integer, then it is possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers. Hereâ€™s how you can implement this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        # Check if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. Calculate the total amount of water.
2. Check if the total amount of water is divisible by `n` (the number of containers).
3. If it is divisible, print 'YES'; otherwise, print 'NO'.
