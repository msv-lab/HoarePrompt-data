Output State: **`index` is 8 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `n` is an integer value from `data[index-1]`**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `7 + n` to `8 + n`. The other variables (`t`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `index` is used in the context of accessing `data`, making it `data[8 + n]` for the value of `n`.
