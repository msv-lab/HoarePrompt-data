Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes a string input from the user, removes any leading or trailing spaces, and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
