Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `n` and value 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency count of `n` in the dictionary `freq`. Since `n` is the first element of `arr`, `freq[n]` is set to `1` (as `freq.get(n, 0)` returns `0` initially, and then `1` is added). All other variables remain unchanged.
