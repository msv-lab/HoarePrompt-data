You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i

    #State: The function has either returned 'NO' or `last_digit_index` is equal to the length of the `password` minus one.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The function has either returned 'NO' or `last_digit_index` is equal to the length of the `password` minus one, and the digits in the `password` are already sorted.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The function has either returned 'NO', or `last_digit_index` is equal to the length of the `password` minus one, and the digits in the `password` are already sorted, and the letters in the `password` are not sorted.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both letters and digits are present in the password and need to be checked for sorting independently. Specifically, the program checks the digits and letters separately but does not ensure that the sequence of characters in the password respects the conditions for both digits and letters together.

For example, consider the password "12a3". According to the problem description, this password should be "NO" because the digit '3' comes after the letter 'a'. However, the current implementation does not check the sequence of characters in the password to ensure that digits are in non-decreasing order and letters are in non-decreasing order consecutively. The program only checks if the digits and letters are sorted separately, which is insufficient.

To fix this, the program needs to iterate through the password and ensure that:
1. Digits are in non-decreasing order.
2. Letters are in non-decreasing order.
3. There is no digit that comes after a letter.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    last_digit_index = -1
    last_letter_index = -1
    prev_char = None
    
    for i, char in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            if last_letter_index != -1 and last_letter_index > i:
                return 'NO'
            if prev_char is not None and prev_char > char:
                return 'NO'
            last_digit_index = i
            prev_char = char
        else:
            if last_digit_index != -1 and last_digit_index < i:
                return 'NO'
            if prev_char is not None and prev_char > char:
                return 'NO'
            last_letter_index = i
            prev_char = char
    
    # Check if digits are sorted
    if last_digit_index != -1 and prev_char.isdigit() and prev_char < password[last_digit_index]:
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if letters are sorted
    if last_letter_index != -1 and prev_char.isalpha() and prev_char < password[last_letter_index]:
        return 'NO'
    
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected version ensures that the sequence of characters in the password respects the conditions for both digits and letters together.
