Output State: **`prod` is now `prod * r`, `r` is the next element in `vals`, `vals` is the list without the first element, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 50\)**.

Explanation: The line `prod *= r` multiplies the current value of `prod` by the next element `r` in the list `vals`. The other variables `t` and `N` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The list `vals` is updated to be the list without its first element, and `r` is set to the next element in this updated list.
