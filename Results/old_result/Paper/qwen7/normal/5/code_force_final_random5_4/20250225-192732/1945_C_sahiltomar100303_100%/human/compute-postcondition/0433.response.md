Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1` + 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is now `0`, `mid` is 0, `right` is now `right + 1`, `tleftZero` is either 0 or 1, `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1` if `s[right]` is '0', and `trightOne` is `trightOne - 1` if `s[right]` is '1'**.

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
