You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `m-1`. The variables `start` and `end` will be adjusted based on the number of iterations `m`. Specifically, `start` will be the initial value of `start` minus `2 * m`, and `end` will be the last `end` value entered by the user minus 1. The variable `s` will be 0 because it is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The variable `s2` will hold the minimum absolute difference calculated from the values in `d1` and `d2` arrays, depending on whether `start` is less than `end`.
    #
    #In summary, the final state of the variables after the loop completes all iterations will be:
    #- `i`: `m-1`
    #- `start`: Initial `start` value minus `2 * m`
    #- `end`: Last `end` value minus 1
    #- `s`: 0
    #- `s2`: Minimum absolute difference from `d1` and `d2` arrays based on the condition `start < end`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n, a strictly increasing list of n non-negative integers, and an integer m representing the number of queries. It then handles each query by calculating the minimum absolute difference between the values at indices x_i and y_i in the list. The function outputs these minimum differences for all queries.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the closest city and calculating the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities is flawed.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Closest City Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the closest city using a sliding window approach, but it does not correctly handle the unique closest city requirement. The logic inside the `while` loops is not designed to find the closest city efficiently or accurately.

2. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**: The program uses a dictionary (`d1` and `d2`) to store the cumulative distances, but it does not correctly compute these distances. The distances are being updated incorrectly, leading to wrong results.

3. **Query Handling**: The program attempts to handle the queries by using the precomputed distances stored in the dictionaries. However, the way it calculates the minimum number of coins for each query is also incorrect.

To illustrate the issue, consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- Cities are located at `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`.
- Queries are `(1, 4)`, `(1, 5)`, `(3, 4)`, `(3, 2)`, and `(5, 1)`.

The expected outputs are `3`, `8`, `1`, `4`, and `14` respectively. However, the program does not produce these results due to the incorrect logic.

A correct implementation would involve a more straightforward approach to find the closest city for each position and then use dynamic programming or a similar method to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for each query.
