Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is False, `s` is a list with two elements \([(k - (1 + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\), `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\), `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` and `a[ps - 1] != maxa**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ps` to be `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
