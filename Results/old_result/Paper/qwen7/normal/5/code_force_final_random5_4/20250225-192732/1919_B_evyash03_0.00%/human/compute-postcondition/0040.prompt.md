You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer representing the length of the string expression.
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
        
    #State: Output State: The entire `expression` string has been processed, `balance` is 0, `count` is equal to the number of times `balance` became negative during the iteration of the `expression`, and `char` will be the first character of the `expression` since it would have been the last character checked before the loop terminated.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `expression` string will be fully processed, `balance` will be 0 (indicating that any initial imbalance has been corrected), `count` will hold the total number of times `balance` went below zero, and `char` will be the first character of the original `expression`.
    return count + (balance > 0)
    #The program returns the value of count.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `expression`, a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `length`, an integer representing the length of the string `expression`. It returns the count of "+" characters in the string `expression`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of count.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
