Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2, `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` is equal to `i` and `idx2` is equal to `i`, then `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`. Otherwise, `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0.
