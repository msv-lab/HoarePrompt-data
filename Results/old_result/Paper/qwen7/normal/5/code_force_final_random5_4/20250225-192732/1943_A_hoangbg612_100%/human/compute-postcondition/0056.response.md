Postcondition: **`cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary that still has at least one key left to iterate over, `cnt` is a list with the key `k` appended to it. If `M[k]` equals 1, the function continues with the current state. Otherwise, the function still maintains the same state as the precondition.**
