Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly updates the coordinates of a player or ball based on the direction provided. It handles the four possible directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') appropriately by modifying the respective row or column value. If the direction is invalid, it does nothing, which is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them as eliminated by setting their positions to `[-1, -1]`. It then prints the elimination event in the correct format and order. The use of `sorted(out)` ensures that players are printed in the correct order when multiple players are eliminated simultaneously.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main logic correctly initializes the game state by parsing the input and storing the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
   - The main loop iterates over each step of the game, updating the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the actions provided.
   - The main loop correctly handles catching and throwing the Quaffle.
   - The main loop correctly checks if a player has scored a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - The main loop calls `func_2` at each step to handle player eliminations due to Bludgers.
   - The main loop prints the final score at the end of the game.

Given that all parts of the program correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
