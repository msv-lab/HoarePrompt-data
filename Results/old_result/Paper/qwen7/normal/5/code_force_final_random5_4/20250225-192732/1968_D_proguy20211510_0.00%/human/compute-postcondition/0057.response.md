Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True, `s` is a list with one element \((k - 2) * maxa\), `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\), where `a[pb - 1] == maxa` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `b` remains as \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\) and `foundb` is updated accordingly, and the condition `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true.**

Explanation: The variable `founds` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
