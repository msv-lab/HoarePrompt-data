Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`, and `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. The values of `j`, `ans`, `a`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.
