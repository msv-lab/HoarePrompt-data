Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns the maximum value between the count of boxes where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1' (indicating cats need to be added), and the count of boxes where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' (indicating cats need to be removed).**
