Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is `end` - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start < end` is true, or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` if `start < end` is false.**

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state of `end` is its original value minus 1, while the rest of the variables retain their initial values or conditions.
