Postcondition: `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, `t` must be greater than 0, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and either the index of the first '1' in `a` is found and the next character after the first '1' is not '1', or `a.index('1')` is the last index of '1' in `a` or there is at least one '1' in `a` and the character following the first '1' is also '1'.
