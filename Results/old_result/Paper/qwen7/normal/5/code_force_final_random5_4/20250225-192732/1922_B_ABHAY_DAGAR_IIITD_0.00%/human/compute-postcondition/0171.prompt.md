Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `total_count` will be the sum of all values from `num_of_lens.values()` for every iteration. The variable `res` will contain the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions across all iterations. The list `results` will contain the value of `res` after each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list that must be initialized with the correct values for `res` after each iteration, total_count is the sum of all values from `num_of_lens.values()` for every iteration, res is the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions across all iterations

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list with at least one element, `total_count` is the same as before, `res` is the same as before, `result` is the next element in the list `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list with at least two elements, `total_count` is the same as before, `res` is the same as before, `result` is the next element in the list `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
