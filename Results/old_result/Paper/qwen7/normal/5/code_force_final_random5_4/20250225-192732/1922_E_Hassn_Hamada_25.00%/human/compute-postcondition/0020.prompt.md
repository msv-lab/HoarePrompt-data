Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `number` must be at least 31, `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0, `size` is 5.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. After each iteration, `size` increases by 1. Starting from `size = 1`, the condition will hold true until `size = 5`, where `(1 << 5 + 1) - 1 = 63` would break the condition if `number` is 31 or less. Therefore, after all iterations, `size` will be 5, and `number` must be at least 31 for the loop to have completed all its iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(size):
    sequence.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sequence` has the last element appended with the value of `i`, and `i` retains its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sequence` has its last element updated to `i+1`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sequence` has its last element updated to `i+1` and `i` is now `i+1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
