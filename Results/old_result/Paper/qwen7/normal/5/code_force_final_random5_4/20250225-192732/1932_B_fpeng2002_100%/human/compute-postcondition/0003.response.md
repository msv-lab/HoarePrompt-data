Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `num_tests` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition of being greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0.
