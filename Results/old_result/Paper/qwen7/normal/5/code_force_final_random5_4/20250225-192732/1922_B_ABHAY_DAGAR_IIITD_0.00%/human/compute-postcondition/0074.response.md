Output State: **`num_of_lens[5]` is now 2, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `total_count`, `res`, `results`, and `num_list` retain their properties.**

Explanation: The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` updates the value of `num_of_lens[x]` to 1. Given that the initial state mentions `num_of_lens[5]` is updated either by `num_of_lens[5] += 1` or `num_of_lens[5] = 1`, and since the current operation is setting it to 1, if it was previously 0, it becomes 1. However, since it is already mentioned as updated, it implies it was set to 1 before or was 0 and now is 1. Thus, if it was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it remains 1 but the count increases to 2. The other variables (`test_cases`, `total_count`, `res`, `results`, and `num_list`) remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
