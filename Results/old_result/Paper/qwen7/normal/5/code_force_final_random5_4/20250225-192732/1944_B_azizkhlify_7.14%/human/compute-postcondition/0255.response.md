Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `input().split()`, which reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. These strings are then converted to integers and assigned to `n` and `k`. The initial state's input being a positive integer is now split into two separate integers, `n` and `k`.
