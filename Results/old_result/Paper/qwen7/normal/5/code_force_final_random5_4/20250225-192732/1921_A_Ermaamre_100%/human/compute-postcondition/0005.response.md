Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers entered by the user.
- `x` is a list of the first elements from each of the 4 lists in `a`.
- `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(dx * dx)`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers entered by the user. Let's denote these lists as `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`.
2. `x` is a list of the first elements from each of the 4 lists in `a`. So, `x` would be `[a[0][0], a[1][0], a[2][0], a[3][0]`.
3. `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. Therefore, `dx = max(x) - min(x)`.

The expression `dx * dx` calculates the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

Output: **(max(x) - min(x))** **squared**
