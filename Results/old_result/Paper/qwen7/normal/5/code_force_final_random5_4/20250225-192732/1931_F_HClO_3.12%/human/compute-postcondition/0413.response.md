Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list containing integers, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a3` is updated to the first value from input split into integers, `l3` is updated to the rest of the values from input split into integers.**

This means that the input values are split into two parts: the first part is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are assigned to `l3` as a list. The other variables remain unchanged.
