Output State: **`i` is `m-1`, `start` is `-m`, `end` is `-m-1`, `s` is `0`, `s2` retains the value it had after the last iteration, `s1` is irrelevant, `mini` remains unchanged, `d2[start]` is `0`, `d1` and `d2` are unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

The code `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This list is stored in the variable `lst`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
