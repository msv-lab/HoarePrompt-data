Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2, `x` is either 25000000 or 49999999, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000, 99999999 or -99999999**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides the value of `x` by 2 using integer division. Since `x` can be either 50000000 or 99999999, after the operation, `x` becomes 25000000 or 49999999 respectively. The values of `i`, `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
