Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in N:`. The only variable involved here is `num`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: Since `num` is iterating over each element in the list `N`, before the loop starts, `num` should be set to the first element of `N`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `N`. Therefore, `N` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `num` is set to the first element of `N` and that `N` contains at least one element.

Given the initial states:
- `M` is an empty dictionary.
- `cnt` is a list containing all keys from the dictionary `M` where the corresponding value in `M` is 1.
- `cur` is -1.
- `S` is an input integer.
- `T` must be greater than 0.
- `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split into spaces.

We need to adjust the states of `num` and `N` for the loop to execute.

**State:**
- `num` is the first element of `N`.
- `N` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`num` is the first element of `N`, `N` must contain at least one element**
