Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, and `results` is a list. The key variable for the loop is `t`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`. However, the value of `t` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1, but `t` remains the same. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `results` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`**
