Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer t, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each testcase, it processes integers n, k, P_B, P_S, a permutation p of length n, and an array a of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i. The function returns a result based on the given inputs.**
