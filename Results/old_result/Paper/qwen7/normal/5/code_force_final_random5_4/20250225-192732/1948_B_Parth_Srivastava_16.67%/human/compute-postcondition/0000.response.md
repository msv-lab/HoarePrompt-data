Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state as a positive integer within the specified range.
