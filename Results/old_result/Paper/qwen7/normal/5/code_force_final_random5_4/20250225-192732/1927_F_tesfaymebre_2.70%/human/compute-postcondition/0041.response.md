Output State: **`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is updated to be the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is updated to be the root of `v` in the DSU structure.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` function call unites the sets containing nodes `u` and `v` in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure. This operation updates the parent pointers (`parent_u` and `parent_v`) to point to the new root of their respective sets. The weights (`w`), the initial elements (`u` and `v`), and the minimum edge (`_min_edge`) remain unchanged.
