Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the decoding logic based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts. This allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it correctly extracts the necessary information (length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself).

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - It first finds all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It creates a mapping where each character is paired with its symmetric counterpart from the sorted list of unique characters.
   - It then uses this mapping to decode the encoded string by replacing each character according to the mapping.

4. **Output**: The decoded strings are collected and printed out one by one.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program accurately decodes the encoded strings. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
