Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. It handles the special case where the maximum value in the array `a` is the same at both starting positions (`P_B` and `P_S`). In this case, it prints 'Draw'.
3. The logic for determining the winner involves calculating the cumulative scores for both players over `k` turns, taking into account the permutations and the maximum value in `a`.
4. The program uses a dynamic approach to calculate the cumulative scores for both players, ensuring that the scores are updated correctly based on the permutations and the maximum value in `a`.
5. The final comparison of the cumulative scores correctly determines the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

Given the detailed execution summary and the analysis above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
