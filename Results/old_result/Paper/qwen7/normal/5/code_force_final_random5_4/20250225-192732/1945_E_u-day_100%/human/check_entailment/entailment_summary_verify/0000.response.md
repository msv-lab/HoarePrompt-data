### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Function 3 Analysis:
- The function `func_3` takes a permutation array `arr` of length `n` and an integer `k`.
- It first finds the position of `k` in the array using a simple loop.
- Then, it performs a binary search to find the smallest index `low` where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k`, or 0 if no such index exists.
- If `arr[low]` equals `k`, it prints `0`.
- Otherwise, it prints `1`, `low + 1`, and `pos + 1`, where `pos` is the initial position of `k`.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation such that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.
- The program should output the number of operations (0, 1, or 2) and the pairs of indices to swap if necessary.

#### Provided Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  1 4
  4 5
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  1
  1 4
  ```

The actual output is incorrect because it does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. The program only checks if `arr[low] == k` and prints `0` or `1` accordingly without attempting to rearrange the elements if `k` is not found.

However, the function summary provided indicates that the function does not return any value but modifies the output through print statements. This means the function does not actually perform the swaps needed to rearrange the permutation. Instead, it only prints the number of operations and the indices to swap if necessary.

Given the function summary, the program is supposed to handle the case where the target value `k` is not present in the permutation by printing the necessary operations and indices to swap. The function summary suggests that the program should work as intended, even though the actual implementation might have issues.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not handle the case where the target value is not present in the permutation.
- However, the function summary provided indicates that the program should work as intended, and the issue lies in the implementation rather than the logic itself.

Therefore, the program is logically correct based on the function summary, but the implementation has a flaw in ensuring that the target value is correctly placed after the swaps.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is logically correct based on the function summary, but the implementation has a flaw in ensuring that the target value is correctly placed after the swaps.
