Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is increased by 2**

Explanation: The line `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was previously increased by 1, now it is increased by 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.
