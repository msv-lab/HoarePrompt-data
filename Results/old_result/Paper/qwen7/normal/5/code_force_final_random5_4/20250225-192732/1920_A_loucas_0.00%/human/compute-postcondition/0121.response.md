Output State: **`i` is `min(less) + 1`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, `num` is 1, `big` contains `[a]`, `no` is an empty list, `x` is 1, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` (which is an input integer) to the list `big`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `big` now contains the element `[a]`.
