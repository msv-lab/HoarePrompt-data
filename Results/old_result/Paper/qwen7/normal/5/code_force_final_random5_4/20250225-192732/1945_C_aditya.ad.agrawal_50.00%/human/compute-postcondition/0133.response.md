Output State: **`b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2)`, `t` is a positive value, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers converted from each character in `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0**

Explanation: The line `b_d = dist` assigns the value of `dist` to `b_d`. Since `dist` is defined as `abs(n / 2)`, `b_d` now holds the same value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
