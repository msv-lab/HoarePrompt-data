Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1()` with a binary string `s` as input, where the length of `s` is between 2 and 200,000 characters, and `s` consists only of '0' and '1'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
