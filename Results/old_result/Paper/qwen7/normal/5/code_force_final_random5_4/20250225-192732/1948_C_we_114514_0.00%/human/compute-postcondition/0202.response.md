Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is `n - 1` or `j + 1`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `reachable_first_row` is `True` if `row1[j]` is `'>'`, otherwise `reachable_first_row` is `False`.
- `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `j` is between `0` and `n - 1` (inclusive) and either `row1[j]` is `'>'` or `row2[j]` is `'>'`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` is `False`.
- If `j == n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop starts from `0` and goes up to `n-1`.
   - If `j` was `n - 1` or `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means `j` could have been `n - 1` or `n - 2` (since `j + 1` would be `n - 1`).
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is a positive integer and does not change within the loop.

3. **Variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`:**
   - These variables depend on the values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]` at each iteration.
   - `reachable_first_row` is determined by `row1[j]` being `'>'`.
   - `reachable_second_row` is determined by `j` being within the bounds `[0, n-1]` and either `row1[j]` or `row2[j]` being `'>'`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
- If `j` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be `0` (since `range(n)` will start from `0`).
- If `j` was `n - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be `n - 1`.

Given these points, let's consider both cases:

#### Case 1: `j` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration
- `j` will be `0` in the next iteration.
- `reachable_first_row` will be `False` because `row1[0]` is not necessarily `'>'`.
- `reachable_second_row` will be `True` if `row1[0]` or `row2[0]` is `'>'`.

#### Case 2: `j` was `n - 2` at the end of the previous iteration
- `j` will be `n - 1` in the next iteration.
- `reachable_first_row` will be `False` because `row1[n-1]` is not necessarily `'>'`.
- `reachable_second_row` will remain unchanged based on the condition `j == n - 1`.

### Final State
Since the loop will start from `0` in the next iteration if `j` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we will use the first case for the final answer.

State: **`j` is `0`, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `row1[0]` or `row2[0]` is `'>'`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` is `False`.**
