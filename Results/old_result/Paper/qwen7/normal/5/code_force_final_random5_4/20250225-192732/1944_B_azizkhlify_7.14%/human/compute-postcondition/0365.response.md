Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `i` was being incremented and the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` was being checked to increment `ur`. Since the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables, the values of `i`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` remain unchanged from their state at the end of the previous iteration.
