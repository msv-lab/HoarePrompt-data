Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `buffer` is now a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `w`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, `buffer` is updated to `w`, `i` remains 0, and `n` remains unchanged.
