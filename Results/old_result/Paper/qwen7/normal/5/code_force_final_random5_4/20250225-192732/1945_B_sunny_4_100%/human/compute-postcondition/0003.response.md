Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `qi` is 0, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `m` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `qi` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated values for `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers provided by the input, while `t` and `qi` retain their original values.
