You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a value between 1 and 1000, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `i` in range(t) and `i` will reach `t-1`), `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user for each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, regardless of the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` being met or not, the values of `t` and `i` will be as described, and `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the last set of values entered by the user before the loop terminates.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NONE".

Now, let's verify that these checks cover all possible scenarios:

- **Stair Condition**: `a < b < c` is correctly checked.
- **Peak Condition**: `a < b > c` is correctly checked.
- **Neither Stair Nor Peak**: This is correctly handled by the `else` block, which prints "NONE".

Given the problem statement and the example inputs, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic for determining whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles all possible cases.

**Correctness: **True**
