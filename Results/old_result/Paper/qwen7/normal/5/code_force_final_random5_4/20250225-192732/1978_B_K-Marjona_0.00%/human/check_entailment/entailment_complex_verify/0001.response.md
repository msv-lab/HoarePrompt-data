### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - If \( b \leq a \), selling all buns at the usual price \( a \) is the best option.
   - Otherwise, we need to find the optimal \( k \) such that the sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns plus the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It calculates \( k \) as \( \min(n, b - a) \). This ensures \( k \) is within the valid range and reflects the difference between the usual price and the modified price.
   - If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \) because selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \left( \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \right) \times k + (n - k) \times a
     \]
     This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic for calculating \( k \) is correct.
   - The condition \( b \leq a \) correctly handles the scenario where selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - The profit calculation formula is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

However, there is a subtle issue with the profit calculation formula. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns should be:
\[
\text{Sum of modified prices} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1)
\]
This sum can be simplified using the formula for the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} b - \sum_{i=1}^{k} i + \sum_{i=1}^{k} 1 = k \cdot b - \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + k = k \left(b + 1 - \frac{k+1}{2}\right)
\]
Thus, the correct profit calculation should be:
\[
\text{Profit} = k \left(b + 1 - \frac{k+1}{2}\right) + (n - k) \cdot a
\]

The given solution uses:
\[
\text{Profit} = \left( \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \right) \times k + (n - k) \cdot a
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\text{Profit} = \left( \frac{2b - k + 1}{2} \right) \times k + (n - k) \cdot a = \left( b + \frac{1 - k}{2} \right) \times k + (n - k) \cdot a
\]
This is not exactly the same as the correct formula.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is close but not entirely correct due to the discrepancy in the profit calculation formula.
