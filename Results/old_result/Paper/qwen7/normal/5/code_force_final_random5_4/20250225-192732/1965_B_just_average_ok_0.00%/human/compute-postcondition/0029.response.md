Output State: `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is less than 1 << 4 (which equals 16), `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 4.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 << \text{idx}\). Given that `k` starts at least at 16777216, which is \(2^{24}\), the loop increments `idx` until \(1 << \text{idx}\) is no longer less than `k`. After executing the loop 4 times, `idx` becomes 4, making \(1 << 4 = 16\). Since `k` is at least 16777216, it will now be less than 16, thus breaking the loop.
