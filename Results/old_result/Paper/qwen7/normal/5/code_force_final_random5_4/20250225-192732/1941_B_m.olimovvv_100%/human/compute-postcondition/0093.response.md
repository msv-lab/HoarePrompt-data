Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and an array a consisting of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on the given test case, which could involve analyzing the array a and performing some operations depending on t and n.**

Note: The actual operations to be performed on the array a and the exact nature of the return value are not specified in the provided information.
