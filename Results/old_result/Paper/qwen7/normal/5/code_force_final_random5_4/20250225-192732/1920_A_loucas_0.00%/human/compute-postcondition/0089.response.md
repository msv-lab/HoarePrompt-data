Output State: **`iterable2` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `no` is a list containing the element `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `a` is an input integer, the list `no` now contains the element `a`. The values of `iterable2`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.
