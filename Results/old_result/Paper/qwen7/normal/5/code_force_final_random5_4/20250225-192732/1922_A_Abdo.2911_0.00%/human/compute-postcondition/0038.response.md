Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of string `a`, and the character at index `i` of `template` is not lowercase. Additionally, either the character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of `template` after lowercasing, or the character at index `i` of `b` is equal to the character at index `template` after lowercasing, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
