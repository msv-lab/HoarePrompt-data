Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 7.
- `n` must be greater than 6, but its exact value is not specified.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a` is a list, and `i` is used as an index to access an element in the list `a`. Since `i` is 7, the code will attempt to print the element at index 7 of the list `a` twice, separated by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

However, the value of `a` is not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `a`.

Output: **[element at index 7 of list a] [element at index 7 of list a]**
