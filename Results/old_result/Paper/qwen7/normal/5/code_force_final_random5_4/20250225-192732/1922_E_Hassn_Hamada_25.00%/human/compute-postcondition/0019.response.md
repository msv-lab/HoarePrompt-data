Output State: `sequence` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, `i` is `4`, and `size` is `5`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `size` will be 5 because the loop increments `size` until `(1 << size + 1) - 1` exceeds `number`, which is at least 31. In each iteration, `sequence` appends the current value of `i`, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 each time. By the end of the loop, `sequence` will contain the integers from 0 to 4, and `i` will be equal to `size - 1`, which is 4.
