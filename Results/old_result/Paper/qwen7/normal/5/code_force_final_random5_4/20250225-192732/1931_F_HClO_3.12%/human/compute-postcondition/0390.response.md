Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list, and `m` equals 2.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, and no changes were made to any variables within the context of a loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
