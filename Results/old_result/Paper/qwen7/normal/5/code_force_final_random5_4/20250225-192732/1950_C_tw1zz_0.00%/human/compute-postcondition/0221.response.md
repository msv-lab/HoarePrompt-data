Output State: **`user_input` is `user_input - 1`, `h` is a string from the input split by ':', `m` is a string from the input split by ':', `h1` is '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `user_input`, `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
