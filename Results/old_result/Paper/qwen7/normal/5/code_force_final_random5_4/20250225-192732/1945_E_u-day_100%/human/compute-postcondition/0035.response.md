Output State: **`low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, and `mid` is either `0 + ((0 + n) // 2) // 2` or `mid + ((mid + n) // 2) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mid` as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. If `low` is 0, then `mid` will be `(0 + high) // 2`. If `low` is `mid`, then `mid` will be `low + ((low + high) // 2) // 2`. The conditions for `high` remain unchanged, ensuring that if `low` is 0, `high` must be at least 2, and if `low` is `mid`, `high` must be greater than `mid + 1`.
