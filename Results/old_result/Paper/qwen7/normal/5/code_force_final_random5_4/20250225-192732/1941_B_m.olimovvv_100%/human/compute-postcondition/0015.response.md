Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be greater than 4, and `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `t`, `a`, and `i`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
