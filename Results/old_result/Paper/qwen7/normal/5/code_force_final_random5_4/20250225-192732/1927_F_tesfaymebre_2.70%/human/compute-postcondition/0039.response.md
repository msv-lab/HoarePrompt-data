Output State: **`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` is updated based on the conditions described, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the disjoint set union (DSU) structure.**

Explanation: The line `parent_u = dsu.find(u)` finds the root of node `u` in the disjoint set union (DSU) data structure. This operation does not change the values of `w`, `u`, `v`, or `_min_edge`. It only updates `parent_u` to be the root of `u`.
