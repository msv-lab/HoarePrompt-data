Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
2. The key insight is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, then it is always possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers.
3. The provided solution checks if the total amount of water (`total`) is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it returns 'NO'.
4. If the total is divisible by `n`, it calculates the mean amount of water per container (`mean`).
5. It then iterates through the list of water amounts, keeping a running difference (`curr`) between the current total and the target total (`n * mean`).
6. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means we have more water in some containers than required, making it impossible to distribute evenly, so it returns 'NO'.
7. If the loop completes without finding such a situation, it returns 'YES', indicating that the water can be distributed evenly.

Given the logic and the constraints, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
