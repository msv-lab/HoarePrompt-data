Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes necessary variables.
2. It calculates the cumulative count of 1's (`ones`) and the adjusted cumulative sum (`sum`) for the array `nums`.
3. For each query, it checks if the subarray is good by verifying the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \le \text{sumInRange}\).
4. The logic for checking if the subarray is good is correct. Specifically, the condition ensures that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` where all elements are positive and different from the original subarray elements while maintaining the same sum.
5. The program handles edge cases where \(l = r\) by printing 'NO', which is correct since a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the condition of having different elements.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution for determining if a subarray is good according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
