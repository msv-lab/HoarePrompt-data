Output State: **`left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus 1, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid` plus 3, `trightOne` is adjusted according to whether `s[right]` is '0' or '1', `tleftZero` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', and `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is '1'**.

Explanation: The line `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` was `mid` plus 2. After incrementing, `right` becomes `mid` plus 3. All other variables remain unchanged based on the given conditions.
