Postcondition: **`a` is the input string from the user, `no` is False, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the last character in the string `c`, the counter is 0, `b` is the new input string from the user, `slength` is an input integer, and if `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
