Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2, `x` is either 49999999 or 99999998, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000, -99999999 or 99999999**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` was either 50000000 or 99999999, it now becomes either 49999999 or 99999998 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
