Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not handle the logic for calculating Alice's optimal profit based on the given constraints.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are defined but their implementations do not match the problem requirements. `func_1` and `func_2` are placeholders and do not provide the necessary logic to solve the problem. `func_3` does not correctly calculate the profit based on the rules described.

2. **Profit Calculation Logic**: The logic to calculate Alice's profit needs to consider both scenarios:
   - If Alice buys fewer than `k` items, Bob can take all of them for free.
   - If Alice buys `k` or more items, Bob will take `k` items for free, and Alice will sell the remaining items to Bob at price `b_i`.

3. **Incorrect Function Implementation**: The function `func_3` does not implement the logic to handle these scenarios. It simply sums up values without considering the constraints and the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.

To illustrate, let's consider a specific example:

- **Test Case**: `n = 4`, `k = 1`
- **Input**: 
  ```
  4 1
  1 2 1 4
  3 3 2 3
  ```

- **Expected Output**: `1`

However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly. For instance, `func_3` might just sum up the values without considering the optimal choice for Alice and Bob.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem for all potential cases, the correctness is **False**.
