Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int, `val` is an empty list before the loop starts, and if `l3` is not a list where each element is different from `a3`, the loop breaks and the function continues with the updated values of `m`, `a3`, and `l3`.
