Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then computes a list `a` where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `x` plus the initial value `a[0] + x[0]`. Finally, it prints a space-separated string containing the elements of `a`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` set to 0, indicating all iterations are complete.**
