You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" characters. It calculates the maximum depth of nested parentheses in `s` and constructs a new string `ans` containing all characters from `s` that correspond to the indices with the highest depth. If no such indices exist, it returns an empty string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from input.
   - It then calls `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the final result.
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized to keep track of the balance at each position.
   - The balance is computed for each character in the string `s` and stored in the dictionary `d`.

3. **Computing Balance:**
   - The balance at each position is calculated:
     - If the character is '(', the balance increases by 1.
     - If the character is ')', the balance decreases by 1.
   - The balance is stored in the dictionary `d` with keys as the positions.

4. **Removing Last Position:**
   - The last position (length of the string) is removed from the dictionary `d`.

5. **Sorting Dictionary Items:**
   - The items of the dictionary `d` are sorted based on the balance (`x[1]`) in ascending order.
   - In case of a tie, the positions (`-x[0]`) are used to break the tie in descending order.

6. **Building the Result String:**
   - The sorted positions are iterated over, and the corresponding characters from the original string `s` are appended to the result string `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The balance calculation is correct and stored properly in the dictionary `d`.

2. **Removing Last Position:**
   - Removing the last position from the dictionary is necessary because the problem specifies that the balance of the entire sequence should be zero, and each prefix should have a non-negative balance.

3. **Sorting Logic:**
   - The sorting logic is correct. It sorts based on balance first and then by position in descending order for tie-breaking.

4. **Building the Result String:**
   - The result string is built correctly by appending characters from the original string based on the sorted positions.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
