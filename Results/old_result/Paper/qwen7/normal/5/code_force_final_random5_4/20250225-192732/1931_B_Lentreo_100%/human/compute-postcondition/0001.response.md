Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `total = sum(nums)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `nums` and assigns it to the variable `total`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was the length of `nums` before the operation.
