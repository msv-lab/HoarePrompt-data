Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2, `x` is either 50000000 or 99999999, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000, 99999999 or -99999999**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Since `max` can be either 99999998 or 99999999, the list `ans` will now contain 100000000 and either 99999999 or -99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
