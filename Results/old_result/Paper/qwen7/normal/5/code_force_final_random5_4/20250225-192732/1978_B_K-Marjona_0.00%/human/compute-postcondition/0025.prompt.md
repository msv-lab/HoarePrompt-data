You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b, where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed for all the test cases provided by the user. For each test case, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively. The variable `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, `k` is also the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. The final output for each test case is calculated based on whether `b` is less than or equal to `a` or not, as described in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers n, a, and b. It returns the total cost based on the given conditions: n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
