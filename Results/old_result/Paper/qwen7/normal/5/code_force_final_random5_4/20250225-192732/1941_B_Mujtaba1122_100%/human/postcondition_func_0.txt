The function accepts a list of integers and its length n. It checks each element in the list to determine if all elements are zero. If any non-zero element is found, the function returns False immediately. If the function completes all iterations without finding any non-zero elements, it returns True. In both cases, the list remains unchanged, and the variable `i` is set to `n`, indicating the end of the iteration.
