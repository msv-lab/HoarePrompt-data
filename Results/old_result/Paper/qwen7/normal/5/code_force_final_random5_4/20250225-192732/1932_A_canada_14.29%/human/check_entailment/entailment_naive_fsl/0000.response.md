Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for moving two cells forward when possible. The program only allows moving one cell at a time and does not account for the possibility of skipping over thorns by moving two cells forward if the next cell is empty. This leads to suboptimal solutions in scenarios where moving two cells would allow collecting more coins.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
.@@*@.**@@
```
The correct solution should be able to collect 3 coins by moving to the second '@', then skipping the '*', and collecting the next '@'. However, the current implementation will only collect 1 coin because it does not account for moving two cells forward when possible.
