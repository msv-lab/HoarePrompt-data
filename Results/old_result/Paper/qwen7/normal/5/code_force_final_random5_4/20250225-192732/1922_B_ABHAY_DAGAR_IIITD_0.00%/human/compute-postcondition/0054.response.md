Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(test_cases):`. This means the loop variable `_` (which is typically an underscore indicating it's not used) and the variable `test_cases` are the key elements here.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `num_of_lens` is processed as before.
   - `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.
   - `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions.
   - `results` now includes the current value of `res`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. After the previous iteration, `test_cases` would have been decremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `test_cases`, `test_cases` should be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `res`, `results`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`num_of_lens` is processed as before, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`.**

State: **`num_of_lens` is processed as before, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`.**
