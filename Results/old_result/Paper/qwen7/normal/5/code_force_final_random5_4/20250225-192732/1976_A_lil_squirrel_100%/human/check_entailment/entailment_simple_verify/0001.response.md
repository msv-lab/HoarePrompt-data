### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Iteration Over Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if the password meets the criteria specified in the problem description.
   - It separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - If the `letters` list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the `digits` list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'.
   - If a digit is found immediately after a letter, the function returns 'NO'.
   - If none of the above conditions fail, the function returns 'YES'.

4. **Annotations Analysis:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - They accurately reflect the behavior of the function and the sequence of operations.
   - The annotations confirm that the function correctly handles each condition specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases such as passwords containing only letters or only digits.
   - It ensures that no digit comes after a letter and that both letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given the analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct and accurately verifies whether a password is strong according to the given criteria.
