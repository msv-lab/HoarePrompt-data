Based on the initial state provided:

- `thorn` is either 0 or 1.
- `ret` is between 0 and 3 inclusive.
- `s` is a list that has been fully iterated over.
- `i` is the last element of `s` or does not exist if `s` is empty.

The `print(ret)` statement will simply print the value of `ret`.

Since the exact value of `ret` is not specified other than it being between 0 and 3 inclusive, we cannot determine a specific number. However, the format of the output is clear.

Output: **ret (where ret is a value between 0 and 3 inclusive)**
