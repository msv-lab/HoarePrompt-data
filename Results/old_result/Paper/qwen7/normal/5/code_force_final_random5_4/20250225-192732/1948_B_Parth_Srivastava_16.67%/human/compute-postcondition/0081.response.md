Output State: **`i` is 5, `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[5]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[5]` divided by 10 as an integer, `c` contains `[y, x]`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. Initially, `c` contains `[y]`. Since `x` is the remainder of `a[5]` divided by 10 and `y` is `a[5]` divided by 10 as an integer, after appending `x` to `c`, `c` will contain both `y` and `x`.
