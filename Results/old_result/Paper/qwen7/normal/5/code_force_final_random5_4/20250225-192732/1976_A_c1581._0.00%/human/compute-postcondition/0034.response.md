Postcondition: `last_digit_index` is either 0 or -1, `password` is a string with at least one character, `i` is 2, and `char` is the third character in the password (if the first two characters are not digits) or the fourth character in the password (if the first two characters are digits). If `last_digit_index` is not -1, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.
