Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `re` is `re + 2`, `res` contains `a[n-1]` and `a[i]`, and `l[a[n-1] - 1]` equals 1. and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `i`, `re`, `res`, and `l[a[n-1] - 1]`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
