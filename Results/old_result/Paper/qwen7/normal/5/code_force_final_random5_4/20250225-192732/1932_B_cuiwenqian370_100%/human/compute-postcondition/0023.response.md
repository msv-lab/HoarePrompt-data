Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `last_year` is the final value after processing all elements in the list `a` and appending it to `results`.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, updating `last_year` in each iteration using the formula `next_year = (last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `last_year` will hold the final value after processing all elements in the list `a`. The `results` list will contain a single string representing the final value of `last_year`. However, since the initial state does not include `results`, only the values of `i`, `n`, and `last_year` are updated.
