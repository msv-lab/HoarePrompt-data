Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4
   - `r[a[3] - 1]` is incremented by 1 and now equals `r[a[3] - 1] + 1`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 2 * n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts from `n` and goes up to `2 * n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 5 (assuming it increments by 1).
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4.
   - `r[a[3] - 1]` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop head.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` must be 5.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4.
   - `r[a[3] - 1]` remains as `r[a[3] - 1] + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `r[a[3] - 1]` is `r[a[3] - 1] + 1`**
