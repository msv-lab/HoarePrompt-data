Output State: The final output state will be a list named `results` that contains either 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration of the loop from 0 to `t-1`. For each iteration, if the count of 'U' in the string `arr` is odd, 'yes' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'no' is appended. The variable `t` will be set to 0 after all iterations, as it is decremented by one in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `i` will be equal to `t-1` after all iterations since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `results` will contain 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd or even, for a total of `t` such evaluations. The variable `t` will be 0, and `i` will be `t-1`, which means `i` will also be 0.
