Postcondition: `thorn` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer determined by the length of the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character, `ret` is 0, and `i` is not equal to '@'. If `i` equals '@', `thorn` becomes 1; if `i` equals '*', `thorn` becomes 2; otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.
