### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

2. **Rearranging Elements**:
   - The original assessment suggests that sorting the array and pairing the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on, would maximize the beauty.
   - However, this approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty. Consider the example where the array is already sorted in ascending order. In such a case, the beauty would be zero because all differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) would be non-positive.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array \(a\).
   - It then calculates the beauty by iterating over the first half of the sorted array and computing the difference between the corresponding elements from the start and end of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - While sorting the array and pairing the smallest with the largest, second smallest with the second largest, etc., ensures that the differences are maximized for the given pairs, it does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty in all cases.
   - For instance, consider the array \([1, 2, 3]\). Sorting it gives \([1, 2, 3]\). The calculated beauty is \( (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 \). However, if the array were \([3, 1, 2]\), sorting it also gives \([1, 2, 3]\), but the beauty is still \( (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 \), which is the same. But if the array were \([2, 3, 1]\), sorting it again gives \([1, 2, 3]\), and the beauty is still \( (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 \). However, if the array were \([3, 2, 1]\), sorting it gives \([1, 2, 3]\), and the beauty is still \( (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 \).

   - The key issue is that the current implementation does not consider all possible permutations of the array to find the maximum beauty. It only considers the sorted array, which might not always yield the maximum beauty.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty of the array in all cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
