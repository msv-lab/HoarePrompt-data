Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the array `c` formed by the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, while Bob can only delete an element from `a`.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. Given that Alice goes first, she can strategically choose elements to ensure the highest possible MEX. Bob, on his turn, will try to reduce the MEX by picking elements that could potentially form a smaller MEX.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided code sorts the array `N` and then iterates through it to determine the MEX.
   - The logic seems flawed in several ways:
     - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1` and updated based on the sorted elements of `N`.
     - The dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each element.
     - The logic to update `cur` based on the counts in `M` does not correctly simulate the game's turns between Alice and Bob.
     - The final value of `cur` is not correctly reflecting the optimal MEX for the given constraints.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Alice should aim to place the smallest unique numbers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should remove the smallest numbers to minimize the MEX.
   - The correct approach involves keeping track of the smallest available unique numbers and ensuring they are placed in `c` by Alice and removed by Bob.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
