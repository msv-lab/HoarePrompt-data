Output State: **`rightZero` is 3, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` remains 2, `left` is now `left - 1`, `leftMove` remains 0, `leftOne` is now 5, and both `leftZero` is at least `(left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne` is at least `(n - left + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Initially, `leftOne` was 6. After decrementing, `leftOne` becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.
