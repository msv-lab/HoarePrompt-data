Postcondition: **`leftZero` and `rightZero` are updated according to the value of `s[left - 1]`. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1. Either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**
