Output State: **`max_score` is 2, `a` is an empty list, `count_a` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique integer from the original list `a`, ranging from 1 to 2, reflecting how many times each integer appeared in the list, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `num` will be the current value of `num` + 1.**

Explanation: The line `max_score += 1` increments the value of `max_score` by 1. Initially, `max_score` is 1, so after executing this line, `max_score` becomes 2. The other variables (`a`, `count_a`, `n`, and `num`) remain unchanged according to the precondition. The next value of `num` will be the current value of `num` + 1, as stated in the precondition.
