Postcondition: `i` is equal to `mid-1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid-1`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string plus 1.
