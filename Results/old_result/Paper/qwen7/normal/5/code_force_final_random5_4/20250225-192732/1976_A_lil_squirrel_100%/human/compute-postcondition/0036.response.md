Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `password` is a string with at least one character.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(password) - 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Since `i` is 1, the condition `i < len(password) - 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The condition `i < len(password) - 1` must still be true, meaning `len(password) - 1` must be greater than 2, or equivalently, `len(password)` must be greater than 3.

5. **Postconditions**:
   - The postconditions from the previous iteration are retained, meaning `password` remains a string with at least one character.
   - No new conditions are introduced in the loop body that would affect the state directly.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2.
- `password` is a string with at least one character, and `len(password)` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `i` is 2, `password` is a string with at least one character, and `len(password)` must be greater than 3**.
