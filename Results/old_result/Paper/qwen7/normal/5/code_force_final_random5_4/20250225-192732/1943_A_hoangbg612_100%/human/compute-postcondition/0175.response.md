Output State: **`M` must have at least one key, and the value of `M[k]` is 1; `cnt` is a list containing the value of `k`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. Since `M[k]` is 1, `k` is a key in `M`. After executing the code, `cnt` will contain `k` as its first (and only) element, assuming no other elements were previously added to `cnt`.
