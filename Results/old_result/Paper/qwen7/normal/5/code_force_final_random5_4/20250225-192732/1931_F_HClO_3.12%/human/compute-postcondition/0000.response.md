Output State: **`t` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer, the input must be a positive integer. The other preconditions and variables remain unchanged, so the only updated information is that `t` is now an input integer.
