Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is the integer input of the user.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it.
