Output State: **`i` is 3, `last_year` is 1, `next_year` is 4, `a[i]` is 3**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Given that `last_year` is 1 and `i` is 3, we need the value of `a[i]` which is `a[3]`. However, since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `a[i]` refers to the value that would make the equation valid given the initial conditions. By substituting the known values, we get:

\[ \text{next\_year} = (1 + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3] * a[3] = (1 + a[3]) // a[3] * a[3] \]

For the equation to hold true, `a[3]` must be 3, making the next year calculation:

\[ \text{next\_year} = (1 + 3) // 3 * 3 = 4 \]

All other variables remain unchanged.
