Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires splitting the array `a` (represented by the string `s`) into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - It then calls a function `func_1(expression, length)` with the string `s` and its length.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through each character in the string `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` variable to track the cumulative sum of the elements in the current subarray.
   - Whenever `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` and resets `balance` to 0.
   - After processing the entire string, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the points where the cumulative sum changes from positive to negative or vice versa.
   - Each time `balance` becomes negative, it indicates the end of a valid subarray, and starting a new subarray from the next character.
   - The final `count` plus the condition `(balance > 0)` ensures that any remaining positive balance is considered as an additional subarray.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly identifies the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
   - The logic handles all edge cases, including strings with only positive or negative characters, and strings with balanced sums.

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **True**
