Postcondition: **`rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, which contains all integers `j` from `0` to `n` for which `q[j]` was initially greater than `0`, and `q[j]` has been decremented by `1` for each such `j` encountered during the loop execution. If `eta_ln` equals `1`, `rho` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `res` accumulates contributions from each `j` from `1` to `eta_ln-1`, where each term in the summation depends on the value of `q[eta[j]]` and `rho`. Additionally, `rho` is increased by the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for each `j` from `1` to `eta_ln-1`.**
