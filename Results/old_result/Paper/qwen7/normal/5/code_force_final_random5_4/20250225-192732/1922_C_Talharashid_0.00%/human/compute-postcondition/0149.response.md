Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is `end` - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`**.

The code updates the value of `s2` to `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
