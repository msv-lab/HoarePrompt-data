#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of string `s`. The list `d` will have a length of `n`, with each element `d[j]` representing the cumulative balance of parentheses up to index `j-1` of string `s`. Specifically, `d[0]` will still be 0, and for every `j` from 1 to `n`, `d[j]` will be calculated based on whether `s[j-1]` is '(' or ')'. If `s[j-1]` is '(', `d[j]` will be `d[j-1] + 1`; if `s[j-1]` is ')', `d[j]` will be `d[j-1] - 1`.
    #
    #This means `d` will contain the balance of open and close parentheses as we traverse the string `s` from start to end.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: The list `d` is empty, `i` is equal to -1, and `ans` is equal to the sum of all characters in string `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the sum of all characters in string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")`. It calculates the cumulative balance of parentheses as it traverses the string and constructs a new string `ans` containing only the characters from `s` that contribute to a non-negative balance. Finally, it returns the sum of all characters in the original string `s`.
