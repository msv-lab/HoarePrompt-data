You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then calculates a new list `a` where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `x`, starting with `a[0] = 500`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the cumulative sums based on the input lists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `x`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - An array `a` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - The first element `a[0]` is set to 500.

3. **Filling the Array:**
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` starts from 1), the value is calculated as `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The array `a` is printed.

### Checking the Logic

To verify if this logic is correct, we need to check if the constructed array `a` satisfies the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

#### Example Walkthrough

Let's use the example provided in the problem statement to check the correctness:

**Test Case:**
- \( n = 4 \)
- \( x = [2, 4, 1] \)

**Program Execution:**
1. Initialize `a` as `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.
2. Set `a[0] = 500`.
3. Calculate `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + 2 = 502`.
4. Calculate `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 502 + 4 = 506`.
5. Calculate `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = 506 + 1 = 507`.

So, the resulting array `a` is `[500, 502, 506, 507]`.

**Verification:**
- Check \( x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1 \): \( 502 \bmod 500 = 2 \) (which matches \( x_2 = 2 \)).
- Check \( x_3 = a_3 \bmod a_2 \): \( 506 \bmod 502 = 4 \) (which matches \( x_3 = 4 \)).
- Check \( x_4 = a_4 \bmod a_3 \): \( 507 \bmod 506 = 1 \) (which matches \( x_4 = 1 \)).

The constructed array `a` satisfies the conditions.

### Conclusion

The given program constructs an array `a` such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
