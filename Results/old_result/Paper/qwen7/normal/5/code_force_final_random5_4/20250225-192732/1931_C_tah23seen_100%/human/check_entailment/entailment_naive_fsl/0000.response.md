Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not handle all cases correctly. 

Consider the following test case:
```
4
2 1 1 2
```

The correct solution would be to change the entire array to either 1 or 2, which would cost 3 burles (changing all 2s to 1s). However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario correctly. The function `func_1` checks the first and last elements and tries to minimize the cost by either changing the prefix or suffix to a common value, but it does not explore all possible segmentations that could yield a lower cost.

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a more thorough exploration of all possible segmentations to ensure the minimum cost is found.
