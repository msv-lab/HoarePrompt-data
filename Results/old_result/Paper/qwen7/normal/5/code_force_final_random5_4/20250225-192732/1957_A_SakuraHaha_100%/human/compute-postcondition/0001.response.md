Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 100.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads `n` space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Each element in the list `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, as specified by the precondition.
