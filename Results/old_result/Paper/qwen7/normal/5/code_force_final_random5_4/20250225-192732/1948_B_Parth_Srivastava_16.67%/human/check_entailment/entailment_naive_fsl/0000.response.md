Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program reads the entire input into a list `b` outside of the loop, which means `b` will only contain the result of the last test case. This leads to incorrect output for multiple test cases.

Additionally, the logic within `func_1()` does not correctly implement the described operation. It attempts to split numbers greater than 10 into their individual digits and reinsert them, but it does not ensure that the resulting array is sorted. The logic for checking if the array is sorted (`c == d`) is also flawed because it does not account for the possibility of the array being modified during the sorting process.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Read and process each test case separately.
2. Implement the logic to split numbers greater than 10 and reinsert the digits.
3. Check if the resulting array is sorted after each operation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
m = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(m):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    def func_1():
        c = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] > 10:
                x = int(a[i] % 10)
                y = int(a[i] // 10)
                if i == 0:
                    if y <= x:
                        c.extend([y, x])
                    else:
                        c.append(a[i])
                else:
                    if y >= c[-1]:
                        if y <= x:
                            c.extend([y, x])
                        else:
                            c.append(a[i])
                    else:
                        c.append(a[i])
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
        return c
    
    c = func_1()
    if c == sorted(c):
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version processes each test case separately and ensures that the array is sorted after applying the operation.
