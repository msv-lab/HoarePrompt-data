Output State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is -1, `mex` is the minimum value obtained by iterating through the loop and updating `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`, and `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` becomes -1 indicating the end of the loop, `mex` is the minimum value among all `p[i]` where `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` for each index `i` from `n-1` down to `0`, and the list `p` is fully updated such that each element `p[i]` equals `mex - a[i]`.
