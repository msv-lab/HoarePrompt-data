Reasoning:
The given solution uses two functions, but the output hints for `func_2` indicate that the function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` always returns 1, which means it does not depend on the input values `n` and `m`. This is clearly incorrect because the number of valid pairs (a, b) should vary based on the values of `n` and `m`.

Given the problem statement, we need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the provided `func_2` does not seem to implement this logic. Instead, it performs some arithmetic operations that do not relate to the problem constraints. Therefore, the function `func_2` is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
