Output State: **`foundb` is True, `b` is a list with an additional element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Since `foundb` is initially `True` and no other changes are made to `foundb`, its value remains unchanged. The list `b` gains a new element, which is `a[pb - 1]`.
