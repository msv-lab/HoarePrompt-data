Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions for being strong. Let's break down the verification process:

1. **Separation of Characters**: The program separates the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.
2. **Sorting Check**: It checks if both `letters` and `digits` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Order Check**: It ensures that no digit comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking if an alphabetic character is followed by a digit.

Given these steps, let's analyze the provided annotated program:

- **Step 1**: The program correctly separates the password into `letters` and `digits`.
- **Step 2**: It checks if the `letters` list is sorted using `sorted(letters)` and compares it with the original `letters` list. If not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
- **Step 3**: Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted and compares it with the original `digits` list. If not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
- **Step 4**: It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit follows an alphabetic character. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
- **Step 5**: If none of the above conditions trigger a 'NO', it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
