Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, and the loop will continue to execute as long as there are lines left in the input file (or standard input) beyond the first line.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, s.split())` takes the first line of input (`s`), splits it by spaces, and converts each part into integers, assigning them to `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the loop condition for reading further lines of input remains the same.
