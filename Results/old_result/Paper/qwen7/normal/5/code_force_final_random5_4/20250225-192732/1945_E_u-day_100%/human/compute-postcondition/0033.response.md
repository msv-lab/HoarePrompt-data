Postcondition: **`low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`.**
