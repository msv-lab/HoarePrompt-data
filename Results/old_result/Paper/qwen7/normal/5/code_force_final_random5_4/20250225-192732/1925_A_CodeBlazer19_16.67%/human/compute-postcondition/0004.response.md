Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j`, `97`, and `k + 97`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if the value of `j` ranges from `97` to `k + 97` (inclusive). This means that the loop will execute as long as `97 <= j <= k + 97`.

3. **Check the initial state of the variables**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an empty string.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - The loop depends on `j` and `k`. Specifically, `j` should start at `97` and increment until it reaches `k + 97`.
   - Since `j` starts at `97` and increments by 1 each time, the loop will execute as long as `97` is within the range defined by `k + 97`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. Therefore, we need to set `j` to `97` and ensure that `k + 97` is a valid upper bound for the loop.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `j` must be `97` to start the loop.
- `k` must be such that `k + 97` is a valid upper bound for the loop.

Since `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition, `i` is already set to `1`, and `s` is an empty string, no adjustments are needed for these variables.

### State after adjustment:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer such that `k + 97` is a valid upper bound, `s` is an empty string, `j` is 97**
