Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and its range. The loop iterates over `j` from `97` to `k + 97`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676
   - `i` is 2
   - `k` must be at least 98
   - `s` is 'ù'
   - `j` is 195
   - `n` is an input integer

3. **Check if the loop can execute again**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be within the range `97` to `k + 97`. Given that `j` is currently 195, we need to ensure that `195` is still within this range.

4. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `j` is currently 195, we need to check if `195` is still within the range `[97, k + 97]`.
   - For the loop to continue, `k + 97` must be greater than or equal to 195. Given that `k` must be at least 98, `k + 97` will be at least `195`. Therefore, the condition is satisfied.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `j` will become `196`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` will be incremented to `196`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 2, `k` must be at least 98, `s` is 'ù', `j` is 196, `n` is an input integer**
