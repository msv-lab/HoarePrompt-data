Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `results` is a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

The code `index = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `index`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the assignment of `index`.
