Output State: The entire `expression` string has been processed, `balance` is 0, `count` is equal to the number of times `balance` became negative during the iteration of the `expression`, and `char` will be the first character of the `expression` since it would have been the last character checked before the loop terminated.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `expression` string will be fully processed, `balance` will be 0 (indicating that any initial imbalance has been corrected), `count` will hold the total number of times `balance` went below zero, and `char` will be the first character of the original `expression`.
