Output State: **`ptsb` now contains the new element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` and the additional element from the append operation, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `ptss` now contains the new elements `pres[i+1] + rem * s[i+1]` and `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`.**

In this output state, the list `ptsb` has been updated to include one more element, which is the result of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. The variable `rem` remains unchanged as it is used in the append operation. Similarly, `ptss` remains unchanged as no operation directly affects its contents, only the values within it are updated based on the given expressions.
