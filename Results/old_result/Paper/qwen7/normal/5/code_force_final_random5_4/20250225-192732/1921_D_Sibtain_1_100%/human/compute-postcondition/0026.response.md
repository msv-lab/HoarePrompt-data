Postcondition: `i`, `j`, `ans`, `a`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` retain their initial values. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ans` remains 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` remains 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`, with the additional condition that `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`.
