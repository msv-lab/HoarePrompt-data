Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list with at least one element.
- `total_count` and `res` are mentioned but not directly relevant to the print statement.
- `result` is described as "the next element in the list `results`".

Given that `results` is a list with at least one element, the `result` variable refers to the second element in the list because it is described as "the next element" after presumably the first element.

Therefore, the print statement `print(result)` will print the second element of the `results` list.

Output: **the second element of the list results**
