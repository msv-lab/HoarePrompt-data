Output State: `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `True` if `row1[n-1]` is `'>'`, otherwise it is `False`. `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `row2[n-1]` is `'>'`, otherwise it is `False`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be `n - 1`. The state of `reachable_first_row` will depend on whether the last element of `row1` is `'>'`. Similarly, the state of `reachable_second_row` will depend on whether the last element of `row2` is `'>'`.
