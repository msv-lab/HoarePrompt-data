Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in cnt.values():`. Here, `x` is a variable that takes on the values from `cnt.values()`. Therefore, the only object involved in the loop head is `x` and the dictionary `cnt`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `x`**: Since `x` iterates over the values of `cnt`, it will take on each value from `cnt.values()` during each iteration. However, before the loop starts, `x` is not yet assigned any specific value from `cnt.values()`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `cnt`**: The dictionary `cnt` contains the count of each integer from the list `a`. This means that initially, `cnt` is populated with the counts of integers from the list `a`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the dictionary `cnt` is correctly initialized before the loop starts. Specifically, we need to ensure that `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`.

Since the loop itself does not modify `cnt` (it only iterates over its values), the state of `cnt` remains as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should include the description of `cnt` as given in the problem statement.

**State:**
**`cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`**.
