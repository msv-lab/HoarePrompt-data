Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `i` is 6, `sum[6]` is `sum[5] + nums[5] - 1, `ones[6]` is `ones[5] + (1 if nums[5] == 1 else 0)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `i` to 6 and calculates `sum[6]` as `sum[5] + nums[5] - 1`. It also calculates `ones[6]` as `ones[5] + (1 if nums[5] == 1 else 0)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
