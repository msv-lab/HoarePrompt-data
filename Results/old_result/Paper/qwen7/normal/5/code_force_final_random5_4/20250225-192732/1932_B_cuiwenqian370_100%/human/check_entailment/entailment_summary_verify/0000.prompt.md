You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it computes a final value `last_year` based on a specific formula involving the elements of the list `a`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final computed value for each test case, formatted as a list of strings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. Specifically, the logic used to determine the next year for each sign is flawed. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

The program should calculate the years as follows:
1. First sign occurs in year 3.
2. Second sign occurs in year 4 (since year 3 has passed).
3. Third sign occurs in year 8 (since year 4 has passed).
4. Fourth sign occurs in year 10 (since year 8 has passed).
5. Fifth sign occurs in year 18 (since year 9 has passed).
6. Sixth sign occurs in year 36 (since year 18 has passed).

However, the program calculates the next year using a different approach:
- It uses `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to find the next occurrence of the sign, which does not correctly account for the sequential nature of the occurrences.

This formula does not ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. For instance, in the given example, the program might incorrectly calculate the year for the sixth sign, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should use a more straightforward approach to ensure each sign occurs sequentially. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        current_year = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_year += a[i]
            while current_year % a[i] != 0:
                current_year += 1
        results.append(str(current_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
```

This corrected version ensures that each sign occurs in the correct order and at the correct year.
