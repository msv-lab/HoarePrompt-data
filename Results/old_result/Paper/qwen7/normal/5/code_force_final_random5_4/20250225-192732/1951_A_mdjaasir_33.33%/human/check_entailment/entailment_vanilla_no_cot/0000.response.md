Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program `func` does not match the problem description or the given `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function. The `func` function is designed to read input from the user and print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the count of '1's in a binary string, which is completely unrelated to the task of generating `.py` files from `.html` files in specified directories. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
