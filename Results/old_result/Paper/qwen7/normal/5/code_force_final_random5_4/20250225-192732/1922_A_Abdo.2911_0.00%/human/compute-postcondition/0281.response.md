Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, `i + 1` would be 2. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i < n`).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Other States**:
   - The postconditions involving `match_a_b`, `a[i].lower()`, `b[i].lower()`, and `template[i].lower()` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**.
