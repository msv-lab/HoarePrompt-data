Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is either 1 or remains 0.
   - `d[1]` is 1 if `s[i]` is '(', otherwise `d[1]` is `d[0]` - 1.
   - The first character of `s` is not an open parenthesis ('(') if `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(s)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - The value of `d[1]` depends on the current value of `i` and the character `s[i]`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `len(s)`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - If `i` was 0 in the previous iteration, it will become 1 in the next iteration.
   - If `i` was 1 in the previous iteration, it will become 2 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `d[1]` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and the character `s[i]`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `i` will be incremented by 1, if `i` was 0, it will become 1.
   - The value of `d[1]` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and the character `s[i]`.
   - The condition for the first character of `s` being an open parenthesis ('(') is not relevant for the next iteration because the loop will check the next character.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be 1 (if it was 0 previously) or 2 (if it was 1 previously).
- `d[1]` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and the character `s[i]`.
- The first character of `s` is not relevant for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `d[1]` is 1 if `s[1]` is '(', otherwise `d[1]` is `d[0]` - 1**
