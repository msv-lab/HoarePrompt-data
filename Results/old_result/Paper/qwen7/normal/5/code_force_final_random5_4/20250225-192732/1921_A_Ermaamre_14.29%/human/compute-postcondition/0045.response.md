Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are as per the input, `res` is the value calculated based on the conditions given.**

Explanation: The code `x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `x1` and `y1`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
