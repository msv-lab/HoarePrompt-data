Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 8, `nums` is a list containing \([2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, (k-64), (k+1), (k + nums[3] + 1)]\), `idx` is 3**.

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `idx` (which is 3) from the list `nums`. The element at index 3 is `1 << idx`, which is `1 << 3` or `8`. After removing `8` from the list, the updated list is \([2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, (k-64), (k+1), (k + nums[3] + 1)]\). The other variables remain unchanged.
