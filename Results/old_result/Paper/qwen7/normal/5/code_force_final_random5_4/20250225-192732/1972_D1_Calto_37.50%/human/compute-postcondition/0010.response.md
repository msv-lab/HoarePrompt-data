Output State: **`cnt` is 2, `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `x` is `n - 12`, `y` is 4**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `i * i - i` evaluates to `3 * 3 - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6`. Therefore, `x` becomes `n - 6`. Since `n` is not specified, we express `x` as `n - 12` to maintain generality while using the calculated value. The other variables (`cnt`, `i`, `m`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
