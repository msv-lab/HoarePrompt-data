Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`
- `i` is incremented by 1

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k` (where `k` is some integer).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

### Adjusting the State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k` and `k < n`.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
- To ensure the loop continues, `k + 1` must still be less than `n`.

### Updated State:
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` at the end of the previous iteration.
- Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `k + 1 < n`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `k + 1`, where `k + 1 < n`**.

In a more concise form:
State: **`a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `n`**.

So, the final state is:
State: **`a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is 2, `i` must be less than `n`** (assuming `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration).
