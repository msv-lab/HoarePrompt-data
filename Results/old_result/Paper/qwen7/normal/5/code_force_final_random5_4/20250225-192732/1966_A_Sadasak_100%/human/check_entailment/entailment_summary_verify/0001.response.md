### Reasoning:

The original assessment was incorrect because it did not properly address the core logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues and the correct solution:

1. **Original Program Logic:**
   - The original program attempts to use a function `func_1` to limit the frequency of each number to `k`, but this step is unnecessary for solving the problem.
   - The logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed. Specifically, checking if `k` is a value in the frequency dictionary and printing `k - 1` or `n` is incorrect.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to count the frequency of each number.
   - For each frequency, we need to determine how many cards can be reduced by performing the exchange operation.
   - Specifically, for each group of `count` cards, we can reduce `(count // k) * (k - 1)` cards.

3. **Correct Solution:**
   - Count the frequency of each number.
   - For each frequency, calculate the reduction in the number of cards.
   - Sum up the reductions and subtract from the total number of cards to get the minimum number of cards left.

### Correct Solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards_left = n
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards_left -= count // k * (k - 1)
    
    print(min_cards_left)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
1. **Count Frequencies:** We count the frequency of each number in the list.
2. **Calculate Minimum Cards Left:** For each frequency, we calculate how many cards can be reduced by performing the exchange operation. Specifically, for each group of `count` cards, we can reduce `(count // k) * (k - 1)` cards.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left. The correct solution involves counting the frequency of each number and then calculating the reduction in the number of cards based on the exchange operation.

**Final: False**
