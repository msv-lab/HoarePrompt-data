Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is n, `mid` is (0 + n) // 2, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` using the formula `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`, `mid` is updated to `(0 + n) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
