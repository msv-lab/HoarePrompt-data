### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its behavior step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), the received amount is \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\).
   - The goal is to find a set of bets \(\text{bet}_1, \text{bet}_2, \ldots, \text{bet}_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{bet}_i < k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines two helper functions, `func_1` and `func_2`.
     - `func_1(a, b)` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\).
     - `func_2(numbers)` computes the LCM of all elements in the list `numbers` using `func_1`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(n\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - It then calls `func_2(k)` to compute the LCM of all \(k_i\).
   - It initializes an empty list `c` and fills it with values computed as `m // k[i]` for each \(i\).
   - If the sum of the values in `c` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the values in `c`.

4. **Behavior Evaluation**:
   - Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
     - Input: `3 3 2 7`
     - The LCM of 3, 2, and 7 is 42 (since `func_2([3, 2, 7])` will compute this).
     - The code then sets `c` to `[42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7]`, which is `[14, 21, 6]`.
     - The sum of `c` is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`, which is less than 42, so it prints `14 21 6`.

   - This approach seems to be trying to find a common multiple that is smaller than the individual multipliers, but it doesn't guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided solution does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome. Instead, it computes a common multiple and distributes it evenly among the outcomes, which may not satisfy the strict inequality condition.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome. The logic in the code is flawed and does not meet the problem requirements.

### Final:
Final: **False**
