Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `v` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `v` in the list `arr`. For the loop to continue, `arr` must contain at least one element.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `prefix` is a list containing the integer 0 and another integer which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `arr` must have at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `arr`, the list `arr` will be modified as elements are processed.
   - After processing one element `v`, `arr` will have one less element than it had before.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `arr` will have one less element than it did at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to continue, let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `arr` had at least two elements (since it must always have at least one element).

So, if `arr` had at least two elements at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `arr` will have exactly one less element. 

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `prefix` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `arr` will have one less element than it did at the end of the previous iteration.

Since we don't know the exact number of elements in `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only say that `arr` will have one less element. However, we can still express the state in a general form.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`prefix` is a list containing the integer 0 and another integer which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `arr` must have at least one element.**
