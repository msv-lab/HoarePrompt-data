Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    max = 100000000
    min = -100000000
    ans = []
    t = 0
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            ans.append(max)
            max -= 1
            x = x // 2
        else:
            ans.append(min)
            min += 1
            x -= 1
        t += 1
    ans.reverse()
    print(t)
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - `t`, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, `ans` is a list containing integers starting from 100000000 down to `100000000 - t`, `ans` is reversed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of 99999997 and -100000000. The list `ans` is reversed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `t` is 100000000, `x` is 1, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 repeated 50000000 times and 100000000 repeated 50000000 times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
