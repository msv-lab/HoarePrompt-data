Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `u` is the first input integer.
   - `v` is the second input integer.
   - `f` is the third input integer.
   - `a` is the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions.
   - `i` is `i_prev + 2`.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 2`.
   - `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - `c` and `M` remain unchanged.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (`i_prev + 2`).
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 3`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**State:**
- `u` remains the first input integer.
- `v` remains the second input integer.
- `f` remains the third input integer.
- `a` remains the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions.
- `i` is now `i_prev + 3`.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 3`.
- `s` remains updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
- `c` and `M` remain unchanged.

So, the final state is:
State: **`u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions, `i` is `i_prev + 3`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 3`, `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, and `c`, `M` remain unchanged.**
