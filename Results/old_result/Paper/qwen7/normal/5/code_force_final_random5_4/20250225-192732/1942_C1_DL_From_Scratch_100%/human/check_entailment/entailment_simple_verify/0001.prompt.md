You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `count` will be the total number of times `num` equals 1 across all iterations, plus `(x - 2)` for each iteration. `T` will be 0 since all iterations have been completed. `n`, `x`, and `y` will retain their values from the last iteration. `list0` will be the sorted list of integers from the last input. `i` will be `x-2` for the last iteration, and `num` will be calculated as `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1` for the last iteration, potentially equaling 1 if the condition is met.

    #In summary, `count` accumulates the number of times `num` equals 1 over all iterations, and `T` becomes 0 indicating the end of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing additional vertices from the given set of vertices. Given the constraints, the solution needs to consider the gaps between the chosen vertices and how they can be used to form triangles.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading:**
   - `T` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are read.
   - `list0` contains the chosen vertices.

2. **Sorting:**
   - `list0` is sorted to facilitate gap calculation.

3. **Count Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list to calculate the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - For each gap, if the length is exactly 1, it increments the count (`count`).
   - It also calculates the gap between the first and last elements in the sorted list and checks if it is 1, incrementing the count if so.

4. **Output:**
   - The final count is printed, which is supposed to be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces.

### Correctness Check
- **Gaps Calculation:** The program correctly calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and counts them if they are exactly 1.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The program handles the edge case where the gap between the first and last elements is 1.
- **Output:** The output is the sum of these counts plus the initial number of vertices minus 2, which is correct because each triangle requires 3 vertices, and we start with `x` vertices.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program appears to be solving the problem correctly.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

**Correctness: True**
