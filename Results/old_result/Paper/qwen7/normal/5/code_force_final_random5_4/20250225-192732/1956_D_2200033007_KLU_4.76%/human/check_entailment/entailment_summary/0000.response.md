Reasoning:
- The given program does not correctly implement the problem's logic for handling different lengths of the input array.
- For an array of length 2, the program outputs "4 1" followed by "1 2", which is correct according to the examples.
- However, for any other length, the program outputs "13 0", which is incorrect. The problem requires the program to maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations, but the current implementation does not attempt to do so for arrays of length greater than 2.
- The program does not actually perform any operations to maximize the sum; it simply prints a fixed value without considering the actual elements of the array or their possible transformations.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
