Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This involves finding a distribution strategy that meets the criteria for each test case.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k`).
   - It calls `func_2(k)` to get a value `m`.
   - It then distributes the coins using `m // k[i]` for each outcome and checks if the total bet is less than `m`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). Given the constraints (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 20), this function effectively finds a common factor that ensures the result is an integer within the specified range.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - `func_2(numbers)` applies `func_1` successively to pairs of consecutive elements in the list `numbers`. This results in a single integer that represents a common factor for the entire list.
   - The logic behind `func_2` is to find a common factor that can be used to distribute the coins in a way that the total bet is minimized while still being less than the payout for any winning outcome.

5. **Distribution Logic**:
   - The code calculates `c[i] = m // k[i]` for each outcome.
   - It then checks if the sum of `c` is less than `m`. If true, it prints the distribution; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The approach in `func_2` ensures that the result is a common factor that can be used to distribute the coins efficiently.
   - The distribution logic in the main loop correctly checks if the total bet is less than the payout for any winning outcome.
   - The constraints and logic align with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
