Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `row1[0]` or `row2[0]` is `'>'`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` is `False`**.

Explanation: The line `reachable_first_row = False` sets the variable `reachable_first_row` to `False`. The values of the other variables (`j`, `n`, `reachable_second_row`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `reachable_second_row` (whether `row1[0]` or `row2[0]` is `'>'`) also remains the same.
