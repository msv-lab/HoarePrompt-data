Output State: **`i` is 5, `x` is an integer value equal to `a[5] % 10`, and `len(a)` must be greater than 5.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i] % 10` to `x`, where `i` is 5. Since `a` must have more than 5 elements, `a[5]` is a valid index. The value of `x` is the last digit of `a[5]` converted to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
