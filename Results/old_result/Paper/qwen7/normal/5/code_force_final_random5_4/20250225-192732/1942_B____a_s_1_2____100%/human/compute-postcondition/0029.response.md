Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop control. In this case, the loop variable is `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` down to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n-1` and decrements until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is -1.
   - `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[-1]`.
   - `p[-1]` is `mex - a[-1]`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently -1, the loop will not execute again because the loop condition `i >= -1` is no longer satisfied (it would be `i < -1`).
   - Therefore, there are no changes needed to `i` or `n` for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only state that needs adjustment is related to the loop condition and the variables that might change inside the loop, but since the loop does not execute again, these states remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop condition is not met.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is -1; `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[-1]`; `p[-1]` is `mex - a[-1]`**
