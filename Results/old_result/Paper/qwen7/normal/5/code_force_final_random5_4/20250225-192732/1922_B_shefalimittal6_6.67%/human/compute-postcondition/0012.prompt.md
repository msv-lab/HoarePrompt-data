Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nums` is a list of integers converted from the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for x in nums:
    num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, num_of_lens is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 3, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, and `x` is the next element in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
