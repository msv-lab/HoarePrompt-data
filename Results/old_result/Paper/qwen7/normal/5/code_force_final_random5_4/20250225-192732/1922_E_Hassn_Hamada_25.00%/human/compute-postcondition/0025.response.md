Output State: **`i` is 5, `size` is 5, `sequence` has its element at index -result - i - 1 incremented by `result`.**

Given the initial state where `i` is 5 and `size` is 5, the code `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` attempts to modify an element in the `sequence` list. However, the value of `result` is not provided. Since the exact value of `result` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact index or the new value of the element in `sequence`. Therefore, the only information we can definitively state is that the element at index `-result - i - 1` (which simplifies to `-result - 5 - 1` or `-result - 6`) in the `sequence` list is incremented by `result`.
