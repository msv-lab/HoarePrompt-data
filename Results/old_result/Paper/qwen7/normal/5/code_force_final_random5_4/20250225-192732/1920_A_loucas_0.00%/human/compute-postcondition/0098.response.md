Output State: **`num` is `i`, `i` is `min(less) - 1`, `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, and `i` is not in `no`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `min(less) - 1` from the initial state. The conditions that `max(big)` is less than `min(less)` and `i` is not in `no` remain unchanged.
