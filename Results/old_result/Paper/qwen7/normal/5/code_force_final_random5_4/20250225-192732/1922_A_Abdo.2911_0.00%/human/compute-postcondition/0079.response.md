Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `match_a_b` is False
   - `match_c` is True
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `template[i]` is not a lowercase character

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if the lowercase version of `c[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of `template[i]`, the loop will break.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` was not incremented to cause a break in the loop (as no specific condition for breaking is mentioned), `i` will increment by 1.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `match_a_b` remains False as there is no information suggesting it changes within the loop.
   - `match_c` remains True as there is no information suggesting it changes within the loop.
   - `n` remains greater than 0 as there is no indication that `n` changes.
   - `template[i]` is not a lowercase character, and since `i` increments by 1, the new value of `template[i]` will be the next character in the `template` list. However, without knowing the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we cannot determine the exact character, but we know it will still not be a lowercase character unless specified otherwise.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is True, `n` is greater than 0, and `template[i+1]` is not a lowercase character**
