Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the correct positions to swap elements in a permutation array so that a binary search can find the target value \( x \) with at most 2 swaps.
2. The annotated functions do not match the expected behavior for solving the problem. Specifically:
   - `func_1()` is supposed to read and return two integers, but it only returns a map object.
   - `func_2()` is supposed to process the input for each test case, but it calls `func_1()` which is not defined.
   - `func_3()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It performs a binary search but does not handle the necessary swaps to ensure the target value \( x \) is in the correct position for the binary search to work.
3. The provided code does not actually perform the required swaps or correctly implement the binary search algorithm to ensure the target value \( x \) is in the correct position.
4. Given the mismatch between the problem requirements and the provided functions, the program cannot be considered correct as it does not fulfill the task of rearranging the permutation array to allow a binary search to find \( x \) with at most 2 swaps.

Correctness: **False**
