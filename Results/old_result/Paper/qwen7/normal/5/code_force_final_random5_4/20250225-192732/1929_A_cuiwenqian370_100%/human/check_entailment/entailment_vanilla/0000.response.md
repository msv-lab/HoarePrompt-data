Let's analyze the problem and the given code step by step to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

### Given Code Explanation
1. **func_1(array):**
   - This function sorts the array.
   - It calculates the beauty of the array using the sorted order.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

2. **func_2():**
   - This function reads input from stdin.
   - It processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the array and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Reasoning
1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized when the array is in ascending or descending order.
   - For a sorted array \([a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]\), the beauty is \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).
   - In the worst case, this would be \((a_n - a_1)\) if the array is sorted in ascending or descending order.

2. **Maximizing Beauty:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should consider the differences between the smallest and largest elements.
   - By sorting the array, we ensure that the largest difference is between the smallest and largest elements, which maximizes the beauty.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input and processing each one separately.
   - It uses `func_1` to calculate the beauty for each test case and prints the results.

### Conclusion
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The approach is sound and should work for all valid inputs as per the problem description.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
