Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate arrays that meet the requirement of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for cases where `k` is less than 2 and `n > k`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 3` and `k = 2`. According to the problem description, we need to find an array where exactly 2 out of the 3 cyclic shifts are sorted. However, the program only handles the case where `k >= 2` and `n == k`, printing `[k, k, ..., k]` which will always result in `n` sorted shifts, not just `k`.

Additionally, for other cases where `k < n` and `k < 2`, the program prints `-1`, which is incorrect because there can be valid arrays that meet the criteria. For instance, for `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the array `[69420, 69, 420]` has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, but the program incorrectly prints `-1`.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
