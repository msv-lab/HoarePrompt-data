Output State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character; `thorn` is 0; `ret` is 1.**

The code `ret += 1` increments the value of `ret` by 1. Since `ret` was initially 0, after executing this line, `ret` becomes 1. The list `s` and the variable `thorn` remain unchanged from their initial states.
