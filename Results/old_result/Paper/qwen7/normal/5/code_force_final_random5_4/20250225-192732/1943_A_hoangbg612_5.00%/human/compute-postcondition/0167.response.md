Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `cur`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < cur`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `cur` is set to the largest number in `N` that is greater than `cur-1` plus 1, or it is -1 if no such number exists.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `M` is a dictionary where the key is the maximum value in `N` that is greater than `cur-1` and the value is 1, or it contains keys `-1` and `N[0]` with their respective counts if no such element was found.
   - The sum of all values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since the loop will run as long as `i < cur`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `cur`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 3, `cur` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute based on the condition `i < cur`.

**Final State**:
State: **`cur` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3**
