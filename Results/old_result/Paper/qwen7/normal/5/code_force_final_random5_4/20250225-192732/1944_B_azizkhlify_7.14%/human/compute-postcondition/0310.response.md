Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. This means that the element at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is 1. However, the code snippet is printing `a[i]`, not the value of `l[a[i] - 1]`.

Therefore, the value being printed is simply the value of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i]**
