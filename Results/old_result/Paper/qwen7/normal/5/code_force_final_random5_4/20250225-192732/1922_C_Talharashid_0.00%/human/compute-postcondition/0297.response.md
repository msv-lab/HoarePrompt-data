Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `start` is `start` - 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 3, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` to `s2`. Since `start` and `end` are defined as `start - 2` and an integer entered by the user minus 3 respectively, `s2` is now the absolute difference between `d2[start - 2]` and `d2[integer entered by the user - 3]`. The values of `m`, `i`, `start`, `end`, `s`, and `s1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
