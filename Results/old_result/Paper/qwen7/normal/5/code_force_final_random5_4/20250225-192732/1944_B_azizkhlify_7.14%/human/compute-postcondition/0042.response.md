Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `l[a[1] - 1]` remains equal to 2.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2 in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is an integer greater than 0 but does not get updated within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains an integer greater than 0.
   - `l[a[1] - 1]` remains equal to 2 as it is not affected by the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `l[a[1] - 1]` remains equal to 2**.
