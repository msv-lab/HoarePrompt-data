Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(num) - 1, -1, -1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(num) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. This means `i` will take values from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts at `len(num) - 1`, `i` must be set to `len(num) - 1` at the beginning of the loop.

4. **Check the state of `num`**: The value of `num` itself does not change within the loop, but its length (`len(num)`) is used to determine the range of the loop. Therefore, `num` must be an integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`.

5. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to `len(num) - 1` and `num` is an integer within the specified range.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `counter` is 0 (unchanged).
- `num` must be an integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`.
- `i` must be set to `len(num) - 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`counter` is 0, `num` must be an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `i` is len(num) - 1**
