Output State: **`num` is the third element of `N`, `cur` is equal to `num`, and `M[cur]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to the dictionary `M` at the key `cur`. Since `cur` is equal to `num`, which is the third element of `N`, `M[cur]` is now 1. The values of `num` and `cur` remain unchanged.
