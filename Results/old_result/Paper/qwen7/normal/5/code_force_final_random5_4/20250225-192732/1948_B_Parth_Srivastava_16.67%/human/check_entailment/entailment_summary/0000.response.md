Reasoning:
- The program is designed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers.
- For each test case, the program constructs a new list `c` by breaking down numbers greater than 10 into their individual digits and inserting them back into the list in the correct positions.
- After constructing the list `c`, it sorts it and checks if the sorted list matches the original list `c`.
- If the lists match, it means the array can be made sorted by the given operations, and it appends `1` to the list `b`. Otherwise, it appends `0`.
- The final step is to print 'YES' for each `1` in `b` and 'NO' for each `0`.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
1. The variable `b` is not initialized before use.
2. The function `func_1()` is called without any parameters, but it expects input.
3. The logic inside `func_1()` does not correctly handle the merging of digits when the next digit is less than the previous one after splitting a number.

Despite these issues, the overall approach of the program is correct in terms of the logic it aims to implement. The issues are more about the implementation details rather than the core logic.

Given the execution summary and the intention of the code, the core logic is sound. However, due to the initialization and parameter handling issues, the program may not run as intended.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the issues:
1. Initialize `b` before using it.
2. Ensure `func_1()` is called with the necessary parameters.
3. Correctly handle the merging of digits when the next digit is less than the previous one after splitting a number.
