Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `m` must be greater than 2; `a3` is the first integer from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int; `val` is a list containing tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, appended to it.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `m` will still need to be greater than 2 (as it was initially). The variable `idx1` and `idx2` will be set based on the final state of the loop, and `val` will contain a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of `a3` and `l3` from each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int, `val` is an empty list before the loop starts, and if `l3` is not a list where each element is different from `a3`, the loop breaks and the function continues with the updated values of `m`, `a3`, and `l3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 2, `val` must contain at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `a3` and `l3` will be the first tuple from `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to a list containing all elements of `l` excluding `a3`, the postcondition remains as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 2, `val` must contain at least one tuple, and if `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` excluding `a3`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
