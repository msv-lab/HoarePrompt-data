Output State: **All lines from the input file (or standard input) have been processed, and the loop has terminated.**

In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, all lines from the input file (or standard input) have been processed. The loop continues to read lines until there are no more lines available, then it terminates. Each line is expected to contain two integers separated by spaces, which are assigned to `n` and `k`. Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, the loop prints either a list of `k` elements all equal to `k`, or `-1` if `k` is less than 2. Once all lines have been read and processed, the loop ends, and no further operations are performed on the variables within the loop.
