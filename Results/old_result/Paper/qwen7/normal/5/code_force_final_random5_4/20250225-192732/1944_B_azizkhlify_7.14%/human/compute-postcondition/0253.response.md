Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop has executed completely, printing pairs of identical numbers from the array `a` until either `ul` equals `ur` or there are no more elements in `res`.
- The final value of `i` is `2 * n`.
- `res` is empty.
- Both `ul` and `ur` are equal.

Given these conditions, the `print()` statement will simply print an empty line since no arguments are provided to the `print` function.

Output: **Output:**
