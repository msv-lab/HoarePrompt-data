Output State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is equal to the length of `nums`, `start_year` is the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[i] + 1) * nums[i]` for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be the final value obtained by successively applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` to each element in the `nums` list, starting from an initial `start_year` of 0 and iterating over all elements in the list. The other variables (`num_tests` and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
