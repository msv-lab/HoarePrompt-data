Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 2`, `position` is the first element of the `(i + 2)`-th tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the `(i + 2)`-th tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is calculated as `abs(position)`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, and `total_bullets_used` is increased by `health` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
