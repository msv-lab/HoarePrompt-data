Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and an additional element `(k - 4) * maxa`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The line `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` to the value of `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
