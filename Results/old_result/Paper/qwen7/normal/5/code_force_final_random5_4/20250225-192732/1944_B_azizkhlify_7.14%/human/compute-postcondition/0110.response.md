Given the initial state where `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is a positive integer, let's break down the print statement:

- `i` is explicitly defined as `n + 1`.
- `a` is a list (though its contents are not specified), but we know that `i` refers to an index in this list.

When the print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` is executed, it attempts to access the element at index `i` in the list `a` and prints it twice, separated by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Since `i` is `n + 1`, we need to consider if `n + 1` is a valid index for the list `a`. For the sake of this problem, we assume that the list `a` has at least `n + 1` elements (otherwise, accessing `a[i]` would result in an IndexError).

Therefore, the print statement will output the element at index `n + 1` in the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[n+1] a[n+1]**
