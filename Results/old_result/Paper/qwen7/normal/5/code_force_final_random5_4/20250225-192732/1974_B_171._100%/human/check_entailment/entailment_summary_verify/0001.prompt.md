You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    b = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(b))
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
    decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))
    return decoded



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the unique characters in `encoded`, based on a reverse mapping defined within the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded strings according to the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
   - It then iterates through the test cases, extracting the necessary information (`n`, `b`) for each test case.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function takes an encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a list of unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It then creates a mapping where each character is paired with its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.
   - Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the entire encoded string.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - For each test case, the program calls the `func_1` function with the encoded string and appends the result to a list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the decoded strings.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Unique Characters and Sorting**:
   - The program correctly identifies all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically. This part is correct.

2. **Mapping Characters**:
   - The program correctly pairs each character with its symmetric counterpart. This is done by iterating through the sorted list of unique characters and creating a dictionary where the key is the character and the value is its symmetric counterpart.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program correctly decodes the encoded string by replacing each character with its mapped symmetric counterpart. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates through the encoded string and looks up each character in the dictionary.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by reading all input at once and then processing each test case individually.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
