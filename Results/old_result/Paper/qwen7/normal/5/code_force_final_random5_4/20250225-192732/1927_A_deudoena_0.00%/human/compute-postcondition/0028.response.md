Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `inpstr`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B'.
   - Either the last character of `inpstr` is 'B', in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no such condition since the else part does not change the variables.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(inpstr)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute again as long as `len(inpstr)` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 1.
   - `inpstr` remains unchanged because the loop body (which is omitted) does not modify `inpstr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B'**.
