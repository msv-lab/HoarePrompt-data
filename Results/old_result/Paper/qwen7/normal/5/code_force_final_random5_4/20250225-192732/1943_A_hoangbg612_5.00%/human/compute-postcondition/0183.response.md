Output State: **cur is greater than 3, i is 0.**

In the given loop, `i` starts from 3 and increments with each iteration. The loop breaks when `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that `cur` remains greater than 3 throughout the loop's execution because the loop continues as long as `cur` is greater than `i`.

After the third iteration, `i` becomes 0 (since `i` starts from 3 and decreases by 1 each time the loop breaks). At this point, the loop condition `i < cur` will no longer be satisfied because `cur` is still greater than 3, and `i` has reached 0. Therefore, the loop terminates, and the final state is `cur` is greater than 3 and `i` is 0.
