Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer from the second split, `y` is an input integer from the second split, `coord` is a list containing three tuples: (1, an input integer), (`x`, `y`), and (2, 2).**

Explanation: The code `coord.append((x, y))` appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains two tuples: `(1, an input integer)` and (`x`, `y`). After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains three tuples: `(1, an input integer)`, (`x`, `y`), and (2, 2). The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
