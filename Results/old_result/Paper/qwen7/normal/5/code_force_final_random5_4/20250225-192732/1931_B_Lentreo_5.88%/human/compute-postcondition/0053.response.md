Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variables involved here are `t` (which controls the number of iterations) and the loop index (which is represented by `_`).

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop runs `t` times. Each iteration processes some part of the `nums` list to compute `curr`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`t`**: This variable determines how many times the loop will run. Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.
   - **Loop Index (`_`)**: Although the loop index is represented by `_`, it is not explicitly used in the postcondition. However, it is still part of the loop head and needs to be considered.

Given that the loop is about to start its next iteration, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is decremented by 1, and the loop index `_` is set to 0 for the new iteration.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `t` must be `t - 1`.
- `_` must be `0`.

Since the postcondition involves `curr`, but the loop itself does not directly modify `curr` (it computes `curr` based on `nums`), we do not need to adjust `curr` here.

Therefore, the state adjustments are:
- `t` must be `t - 1`.
- `_` must be `0`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is 0**
