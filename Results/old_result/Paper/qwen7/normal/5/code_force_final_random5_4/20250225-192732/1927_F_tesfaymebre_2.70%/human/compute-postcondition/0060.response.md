Output State: All nodes in the DSU structure are merged into connected components based on the edges processed. The variable `parent_u` and `parent_v` represent the root of each node `u` and `v` respectively, after all union operations have been performed. The variable `_min_edge` retains its value from the last iteration since no further updates occurred during the remaining iterations. The variable `w`, `u`, and `v` hold the values from the last tuple processed in `edges`. The `dsu` object reflects the final disjoint set structure where all connected components are formed, and the `parent` array within `dsu` shows the ultimate parent of each node.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, all nodes that are connected through the edges in `edges` will be part of the same connected component in the DSU structure. The `_min_edge` value will stay the same as it was after the third iteration, indicating that no further updates to the minimum edge weight in any component were necessary. The `w`, `u`, and `v` variables will reflect the last edge processed, and the `dsu` object will show the fully connected graph with all nodes merged into their respective components.
