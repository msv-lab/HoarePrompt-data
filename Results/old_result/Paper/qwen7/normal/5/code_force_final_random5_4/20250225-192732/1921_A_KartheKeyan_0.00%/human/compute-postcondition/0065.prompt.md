Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is decreased by the number of iterations in the while loop, s is the sum calculated from the loop, there are three lines of input left, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
Code of the loop:
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))
    print(res)
    n -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the third split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, an input integer), (an input integer, an input integer), (an input integer, an input integer), and (3, 3) sorted by their tuple values, `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]), `res` is abs(math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) * math.sqrt(p1)), `n` is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('4', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('x', 'y'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is (input integer - y), `res` is abs(sqrt(input integer - y) * sqrt(abs((x - 4))), `n` is `n-1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing tuples of 4 input integers sorted in ascending order, `p2` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the third and second points in `coord`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `p1` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`, `n` is one less than its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
