You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available (n), and the subsequent elements are the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100, and the number of sticks (n) is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is a dictionary `freq` where each key is an integer from the list `arr` (excluding the first element which represents the count of sticks), and the corresponding value for each key is the total count of occurrences of that integer in `arr`.
    #
    #In more detail, if `arr` contains integers like `[5, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `freq` will be `{2: 2, 3: 3}` because `2` appears twice and `3` appears three times in the list. The first element `5` is not included as a key in `freq` since it was the count of how many sticks there were initially, not one of the stick lengths.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available (n), and the subsequent elements are the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
