Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of length `n` where every element is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `p` with `n` elements, all set to -1. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
