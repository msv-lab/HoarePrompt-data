The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, a, and b. For each test case, it calculates either \(a \times b\) or \(round(a \times \frac{c}{2})\), where \(c\) is another integer input. It then prints the result for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
