Output State: **`s` is 0 + (n + 1) // 2, `n` is `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: 
- The value of `m` is multiplied by 2, so `m` changes from 1 to 2.
- The values of `s`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
