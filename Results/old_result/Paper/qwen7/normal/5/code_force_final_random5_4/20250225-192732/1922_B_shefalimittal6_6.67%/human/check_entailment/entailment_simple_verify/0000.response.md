### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It then reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks into a dictionary `num_of_lens`.

2. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the values in `num_of_lens` to calculate combinations:
     - If `cnt` (the count of a particular stick length) is 3 or more, it adds `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to `res`. This part is correct because choosing 3 identical sticks will always form a degenerate triangle, but we need to exclude this case since we need non-degenerate triangles.
     - If `cnt` is 2 or more, it calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all counts except the current `cnt`, and then adds `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to `res`. This part is also correct because it considers all possible pairs of sticks of the same length and multiplies by the number of different stick lengths that could form a triangle with them.

3. **Triangle Inequality Check:**
   - The annotated code does not explicitly mention checking the triangle inequality theorem. However, the combination logic inherently checks this condition. For example, when calculating `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, it only considers pairs of sticks of the same length and multiplies by the number of different stick lengths that could form a triangle with them. This ensures that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side because the pairs are of the same length and the third side is from a different length.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `res`, which accumulates the correct number of valid combinations.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The annotated code and the program's logic align with the problem description and the triangle inequality theorem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid combinations while implicitly checking the triangle inequality theorem through the combination calculations.
