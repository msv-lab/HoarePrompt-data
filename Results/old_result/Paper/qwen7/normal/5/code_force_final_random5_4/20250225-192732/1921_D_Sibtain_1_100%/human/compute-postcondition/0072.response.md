Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either 1 or 2; `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 4; `t1` is updated to `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input; `c` is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order, and `len(a)` must be at least 4.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` to `abs(a[i] - c[i])`. Since `i` can be either 0 or 1, `t1` will be the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of `a` and the `i`-th element of `c`. The values of `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t2`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged.
