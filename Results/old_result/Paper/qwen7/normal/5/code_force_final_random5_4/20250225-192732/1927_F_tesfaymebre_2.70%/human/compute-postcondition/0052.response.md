Output State: **`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure, the DSU union operation unites `u` and `v` with weight `w`.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` function call unites nodes `u` and `v` in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure, using the weight `w` for the edge connecting them. This operation does not directly change the values of `w`, `u`, `v`, `_min_edge`, `parent_u`, or `parent_v`, but it updates their relationship within the DSU structure. Therefore, the values of `w`, `u`, `v`, `_min_edge`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain as they were, but the DSU structure itself is updated to reflect the union of `u` and `v` with the specified weight.
