Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True, `s` is a list with four elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\), `b` is a list with four elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]\) if `foundb` is True, or \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1] or a[pb - 1] if pb is used instead of ps]\) if `foundb` is False, and either `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `foundb` is True, or `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`**.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true or false, the values of `i`, `k`, `founds`, `s`, `b`, `ps`, and `pb` remain as specified in the respective if and else parts. Specifically, if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `founds` is True, `s` has specific elements, and `ps` is adjusted based on the condition `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `foundb` status. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, then `founds` remains True, `s` has specific elements, and `ps` is set to `p[ps - 1]`.
