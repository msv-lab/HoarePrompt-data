Based on the initial state provided:

- The `colors` list is a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros.
- All nodes in the DSU structure are merged into connected components based on the edges processed.
- The `_min_edge` value remains the same.
- The `w`, `u`, and `v` variables reflect the last edge processed.
- The `dsu` object shows the fully connected graph with all nodes merged into their respective components.
- The `res` variable is the result of the DFS traversal starting from node `u` and excluding the parent node `-1`, and the traversal path is stored in the list passed as the third argument.

Given this information, let's break down the print statement:

- `res` is the result of a DFS traversal starting from node `u` and excluding the parent node `-1`. Since the `dsu` object shows a fully connected graph, the DFS traversal will visit all nodes in the graph.
- The traversal path is stored in the list passed as the third argument, which means `res` contains the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal.

Therefore, the `print(*res)` statement will print the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal.

Output: **the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal starting from node u and excluding the parent node -1**
