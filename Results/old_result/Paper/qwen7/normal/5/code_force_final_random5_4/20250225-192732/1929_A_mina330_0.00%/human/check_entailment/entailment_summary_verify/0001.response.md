### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

2. **Rearranging Elements**:
   - By sorting the array \(a\), we can pair the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
   - This approach ensures that the differences \( (a_{i+1} - a_i) \) are maximized for each pair, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array \(a\).
   - It then calculates the beauty by iterating over the first half of the sorted array and computing the difference between the corresponding elements from the start and end of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that sorting the array and pairing the smallest with the largest, second smallest with the second largest, etc., ensures that the differences are maximized.
   - However, the implementation does not correctly compute the required sum of differences. The current implementation calculates the sum of differences between elements symmetrically from the ends of the list towards the center, which is not equivalent to the required sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

### Detailed Explanation:

- The original code calculates the sum of differences between elements symmetrically from the ends of the list towards the center:
  ```python
  for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
      kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
  ```
  This is not the same as calculating the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

- To correctly compute the beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements starting from the second element:
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n):
      kq = kq + a[i] - a[i-1]
  ```

### Corrected Implementation:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            kq = kq + a[i] - a[i-1]
        print(kq)
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was inaccurate because the provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the beauty of the array. The corrected implementation should use the proper method to calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
