Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\) and \(T > 0\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers.**

The code initializes the variable `cur` to -1. This does not affect the values of `T`, `S`, or `N`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
