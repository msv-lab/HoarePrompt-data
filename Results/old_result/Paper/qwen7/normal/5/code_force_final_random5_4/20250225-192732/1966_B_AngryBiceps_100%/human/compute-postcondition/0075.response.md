Output State: `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input provided by the user; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in the list `a`, concatenated together; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in the list `a`, concatenated together; `i` is `-1`, as the loop has completed all its iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed `n-2` times (since `i` starts at `n-2` and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches -1), the list `a` will contain all the inputs provided by the user, `first_row` will be a concatenation of the first characters of all these inputs, and `last_row` will be a concatenation of the last characters of all these inputs.
