Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that the chosen vertices can form triangles directly without needing additional vertices. The program only counts the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices, which does not guarantee the maximum number of triangles.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4 2 0
1 3
```
The program will output `1`, but the correct answer should be `2`. Here, we can draw two non-intersecting diagonals to form two triangles:
```
1---2
|   |
3---4
```
The program fails to recognize that the two chosen vertices (1 and 3) can form two triangles directly with the other two vertices (2 and 4). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this case.
