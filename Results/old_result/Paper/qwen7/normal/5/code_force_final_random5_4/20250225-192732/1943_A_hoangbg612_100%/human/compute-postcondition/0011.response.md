Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `num`, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least one element, `M` is an empty dictionary, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `cur`, `num`, `T`, `S`, `N`, or `M`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the variables retain their initial states, and the `break` statement is noted as breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
