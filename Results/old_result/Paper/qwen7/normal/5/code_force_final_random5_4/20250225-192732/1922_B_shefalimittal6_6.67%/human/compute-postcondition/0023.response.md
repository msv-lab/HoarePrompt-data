Output State: **`cnt` is an integer, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its current value. The initial conditions for `cnt` and `res` remain the same, and `total_sum` is also unchanged. The condition for updating `res` remains the same as well.
