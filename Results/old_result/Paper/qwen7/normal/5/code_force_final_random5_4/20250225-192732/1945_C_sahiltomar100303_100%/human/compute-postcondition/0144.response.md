Based on the initial state provided:

- `rightZero` is 0
- `leftZero` is 1
- `left` is 0
- `leftMove` remains 0
- `trightZero` is 0
- `tleftOne` is 8
- `trightOne` is 0
- `leftOne` is 2
- `right` is `n`
- `left` is equal to 0
- `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`

The variable `right` is defined as `n`. Since no specific value for `n` is provided, `right` retains the value of `n`.
