Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values and Conditions:**
   - Initially, `i` is 6.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on both `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing.
   - Given that `i` is initially 6, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 6 (since `i` must be less than `n`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

- `i` should be 6 (as given).
- `n` must be greater than 6 to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be greater than 6**
