Output State: **`right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` must be such that `tleftZero < (right + 2) // 2`, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
