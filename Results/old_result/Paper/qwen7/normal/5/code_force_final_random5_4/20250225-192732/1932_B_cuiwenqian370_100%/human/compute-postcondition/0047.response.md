Output State: **`i` is 3, `last_year` is 3, `results` is ['4'], `index` is increased by 1 plus `n`, `a` is [3]**.

Explanation: The code sets `last_year` to the value of `a[0]`, which is 3. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `last_year` is updated to 3, while `i`, `results`, `index`, and `a` retain their original values.
