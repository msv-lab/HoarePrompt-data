Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes variables and reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the size of each test case (`n`). It also reads the input string and converts it into an array of integers.

2. **Variables and Logic**:
   - `z` and `o` store the counts of 0s and 1s in the entire array.
   - `z_r` and `o_r` are initialized to these counts, representing the remaining counts of 0s and 1s on the right side.
   - `z_l` and `o_l` are initialized to 0, representing the counts of 0s and 1s on the left side.
   - `dist`, `ans`, and `pos` are used to track the minimum distance from the center and the best position for the road.

3. **Loop and Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates through each element in the array, updating the counts of 0s and 1s on both sides.
   - The program checks if the current position satisfies the conditions for being a valid split point (i.e., at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied).
   - If the conditions are met, it updates `ans` and `b_d` to find the position closest to the center.

4. **Output and Loop Control**:
   - After processing all elements, the program prints the optimal position `ans`.
   - The loop continues until all test cases are processed.

5. **Final State**:
   - The final state of the program matches the expected behavior, where `t` is 0, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, and the other variables hold the correct values.

Given the analysis, the program logic and state transitions align with the problem requirements and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
