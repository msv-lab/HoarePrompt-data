You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (consisting only of '0's and '1's), and n is an integer representing the count of '1's encountered until the current index, initialized to 0. ans is an integer representing the total cost, also initialized to 0.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is an input string, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence of '0' in `s` followed by a '1', and `i` is the last index of the string `s`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will hold the total length of the string `s`. The variable `ans` will contain the count of segments in the string where a '0' is immediately followed by one or more '1's, plus one for each such segment. The variable `i` will be set to the index of the last character in the string `s`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each occurrence of '0' immediately followed by one or more '1's in s)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a binary string `s`, counts the number of '1's encountered, and updates a total cost `ans` based on the count of '1's.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
