Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part of the loop. This means the loop will run based on the integer value entered as input.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\).
   - `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split.
   - `k` is less than 16.
   - `nums` is a list containing \([2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k-15, k+17]\).
   - `idx` is 2.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if the input integer is greater than 0 (since the loop runs for the number of times specified by the input).
   - Therefore, the input integer must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
   - Since `idx` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will remain 2 unless explicitly changed within the loop body, but we don't assume any changes without explicit information.
   - The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `k`, `nums`) do not change based on the loop head and thus remain the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is less than 16, `nums` is a list containing \([2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k-15, k+17]\), `idx` is 2**. However, since the loop will run again only if the input integer is greater than 0, we need to ensure that the input integer is greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is less than 16, `nums` is a list containing \([2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k-15, k+17]\), `idx` is 2, and the input integer must be greater than 0**.
