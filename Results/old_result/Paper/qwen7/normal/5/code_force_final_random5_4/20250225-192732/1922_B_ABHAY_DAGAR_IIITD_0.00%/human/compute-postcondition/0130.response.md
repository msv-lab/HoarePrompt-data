Output State: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from the original `num_list` (and any new elements added during the loop) has a corresponding value representing the count of occurrences of that key. `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `x` in the final `num_list` and the new `num_list`. `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`. `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`. `n` is the input integer, and `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers. The loop iterates through each element in `num_list`, incrementing the count of each element in `num_of_lens` if it already exists, or adding it with a count of 1 if it does not exist.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `num_of_lens` will contain the frequency count of each unique number from the input list. `res` will be the total count of all numbers in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` will be the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, `results` will hold the final value of `res`, `n` will remain the same as the input integer, and `num_list` will be empty since it gets updated with new elements during each iteration but is not explicitly reset.
