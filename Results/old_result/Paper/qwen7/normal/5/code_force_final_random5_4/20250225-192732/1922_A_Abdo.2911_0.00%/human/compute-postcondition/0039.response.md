Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is the length of string `a`, and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (after lowercasing), or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (after lowercasing), in which case `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the character at index `i` of `template` is not lowercase, then either the character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of `template` (after lowercasing), or the character at index `i` of `b` is equal to the character at index `template` (after lowercasing), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
