Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes a loop to process each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
3. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints "Yes".
4. If `n` is less than `m`, it prints "No".
5. The function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement without modifying the values of `n` and `m` after processing them.
6. The program structure matches the problem requirements and the provided example test cases are handled correctly.

Given the above points, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
