Output State: **`cur` is num, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`, and `M[cur]` is `1`.**

In this case, the code `M[cur] = 1` updates the dictionary `M` by setting the value at the key `cur` to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
