Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` and `m` retain their original values throughout all iterations. The loop processes each pair of `n` and `m` independently based on the given conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly but does not modify the values of `n` and `m` between iterations. Therefore, regardless of the number of iterations, `n` and `m` will always reflect the values they had at the start of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of pairs of positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) derived from a positive integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \)). For each pair, it checks if \( n \geq m \) and if \( n - m \) is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the values of \( n \) and \( m \) between iterations and retains their original values throughout the process.
