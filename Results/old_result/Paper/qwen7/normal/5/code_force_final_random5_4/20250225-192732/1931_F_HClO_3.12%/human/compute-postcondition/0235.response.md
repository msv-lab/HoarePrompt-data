Output State: **All variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22` are set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` will reflect the indices where certain conditions were met during the loop's execution, specifically when `l1[i + p1]` was equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` was equal to `a1`. The values of `p1` and `p2` will indicate whether the corresponding index was found (`p1` or `p2` will be 1 if the condition was met). The other variables such as `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, and `l22` will retain their values from the initial state or the last iteration of the loop, as they are not directly modified within the loop body beyond the initial assignment.
