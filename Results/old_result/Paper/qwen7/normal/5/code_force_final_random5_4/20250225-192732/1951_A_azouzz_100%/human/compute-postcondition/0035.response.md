Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `s` is a new string input by the user.
- `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`.

Output: **YES**
