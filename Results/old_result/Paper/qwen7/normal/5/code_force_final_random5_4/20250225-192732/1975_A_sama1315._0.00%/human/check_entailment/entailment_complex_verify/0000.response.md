### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them any number of times.
- The function `func_1` is supposed to check if the array can be made non-decreasing through the described operation.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` currently checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If the array is already sorted, it returns `'Yes'`.
- If the array is not sorted, it returns `'No'`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It correctly handles the input format and processes each test case appropriately.

#### Correctness of `func_1`:
- The current implementation of `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted. However, the problem requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing through the described operation.
- Consider the example provided in the original assessment: `[1, 3, 2]`.
  - Splitting `[1, 3, 2]` into `[1]` and `[3, 2]` and swapping them gives `[3, 2, 1]`.
  - Splitting `[3, 2]` into `[3]` and `[2]` and swapping them gives `[2, 3, 1]`.
  - Splitting `[2, 3]` into `[2]` and `[3]` and swapping them gives `[2, 3, 1]`, which is not sorted.
  - However, the problem states that the array can be made non-decreasing through the described operation, so the function should return `'Yes'`.

#### Conclusion:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required functionality because it only checks if the array is already sorted, not if it can be made non-decreasing through the described operation.
- Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
