Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(4)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 4.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `y` is an input integer
   - `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`
   - `p2` is 0
   - `res` is 0
   - `n` is 1
   - `i` must be less than 4 (which is true since `i` is currently 3)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` must be less than 4 for the loop to continue, and `i` is currently 3, the next value of `i` will be 4.
   - All other variables (`x`, `y`, `coord`, `p2`, `res`, `n`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `p2` is 0, `res` is 0, `n` is 1**
