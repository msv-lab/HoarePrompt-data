Output State: **`cur` is either 3 or 0, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement in the given code, the only effect is to indicate that we would exit such a block if present. The values of `cur`, `i`, and `M` remain unchanged.
