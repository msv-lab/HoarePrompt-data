Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing two tuples `((a3, l3)), m` must be greater than 2**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`. The variable `val` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The condition that `m` must be greater than 2 is still valid and unchanged.
