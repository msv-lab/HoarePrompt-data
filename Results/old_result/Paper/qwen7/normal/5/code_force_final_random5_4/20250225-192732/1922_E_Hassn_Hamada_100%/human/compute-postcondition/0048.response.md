Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 3`; `value` is \((1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)\); `number` must be at least \(7 \cdot (1 << i)\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`; `value` is now \((1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)\)**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `value` was defined as \((1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)\).
- After executing the line `value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)`, `value` is updated to \((1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)\) because `size` is `i + 3`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
