Postcondition: **`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure, either the DSU union operation unites `u` and `v` with weight `w` if they were not already in the same component, or the condition remains unchanged if they were already in the same component.**
