Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. The variables involved here are the input value (which determines the number of iterations) and the loop counter (which is an underscore `_` indicating that the specific value of the counter is not used).

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The loop counter `_` is incremented with each iteration but its specific value is not relevant since it is represented by an underscore.
   - The input value determines the number of iterations. This value will be updated based on user input.

3. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if the input value is greater than 0.
   - Since the loop counter `_` is not used, no specific adjustment is needed for it.
   - The input value will be decremented by 1 after each iteration, so for the next iteration, the input value should be reduced by 1.

Given these points, the state adjustments required for the next iteration are as follows:

- The input value will be reduced by 1.
- The loop will continue to check the input value until it becomes 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated input value.

**Answer**:
State: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, the input value is decreased by 1**
