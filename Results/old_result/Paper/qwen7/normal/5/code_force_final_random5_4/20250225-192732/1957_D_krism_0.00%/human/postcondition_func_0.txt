The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 10^5), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \) (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates and prints the cumulative XOR of the list elements, initializes two lists `pre` and `suf` to track counts of 0s and 1s in the binary representations of the cumulative XOR values, updates these counts iteratively, and finally computes and prints a result based on these counts. The function ultimately returns 0.
