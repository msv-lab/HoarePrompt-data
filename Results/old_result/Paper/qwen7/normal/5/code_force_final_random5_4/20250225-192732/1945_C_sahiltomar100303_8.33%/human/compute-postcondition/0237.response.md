Output State: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to 1, `rightZero` is increased by 3, `rightOne` is increased by 3.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `left` will be reduced until it reaches 0. The conditions inside the loop ensure that either `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`. Given that `left` ends up being 0, `leftZero` must be less than or equal to 1 because half of `left + 1` (which is 1) is the maximum value `leftZero` can take. Additionally, since the loop increments `rightZero` and `rightOne` each time it runs, and it runs three times, `rightZero` and `rightOne` are each incremented by 3.
