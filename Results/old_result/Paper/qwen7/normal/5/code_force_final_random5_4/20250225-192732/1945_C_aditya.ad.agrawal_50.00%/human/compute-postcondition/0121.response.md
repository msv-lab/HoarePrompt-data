`t` is decremented by 1. All other variables (`pos`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `ans`, and `b_d`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_l` is equal to the count of zeros in `arr`, `o_l` is equal to the count of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is equal to the last position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` were satisfied and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` holds true, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` found during the loop's execution.**
