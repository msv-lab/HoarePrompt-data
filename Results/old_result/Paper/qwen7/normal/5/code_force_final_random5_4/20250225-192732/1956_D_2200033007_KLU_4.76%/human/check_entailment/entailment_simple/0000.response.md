Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
2. The provided code does not actually implement the logic to solve the problem. Instead, it has a hardcoded function that prints results based on the length of the input array without considering any actual operations or the MEX value.
3. For an array of length 2, the code correctly prints the maximum possible sum (4) and the number of operations (1), and provides a valid operation (1 2).
4. For an array of length 3, the code incorrectly prints the maximum possible sum (13) and the number of operations (0), but does not provide any operations, which is incorrect since the array can be modified.
5. For an array of length 4, the code provides two operations, but these operations do not necessarily lead to the maximum sum (105).

Given that the code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all cases, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
