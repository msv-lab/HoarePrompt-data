Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `x` is -9, `y` is 9**

Explanation: 
- The value of `cnt` is updated to `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`.
- Given `cnt` is 2, `x` is -9, and `y` is 9, `x // y` evaluates to -1 (integer division).
- The condition `(i > 1)` is True, so it adds 1 to the expression.
- Therefore, `cnt` becomes `2 + (-1) + 1 = 2`.
- However, since the initial value of `cnt` was 2, the final value of `cnt` is `2 - 1 + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 1`.
- The values of `i`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
