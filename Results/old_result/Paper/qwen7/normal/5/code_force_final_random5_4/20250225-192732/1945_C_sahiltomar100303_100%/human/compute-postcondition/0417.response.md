Postcondition: `leftZero` is reduced by 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `left` is now `mid - 1 - 1`, `mid` must be greater than 2, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must hold true for the next iteration. If `s[left - 1] == '0'`, then `rightZero` is 1 more than its previous value; otherwise, `leftOne` is reduced by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.
