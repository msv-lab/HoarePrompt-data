Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.
   - `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`.
   - `len(arr)` must be greater than 2.
   - `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1`.
   - Additionally, `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

4. **Check the Current Values**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the condition `i < len(arr) - 1` will be true if `len(arr) - 1 > 2`, which is already satisfied because `len(arr) > 2`.
   - We need to ensure that `arr[2]` is equal to `arr[3]` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
   - `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]` for the loop to continue.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` must be 3.
   - `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]`.

Given these steps, the final state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`i` is 3, `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]`**
