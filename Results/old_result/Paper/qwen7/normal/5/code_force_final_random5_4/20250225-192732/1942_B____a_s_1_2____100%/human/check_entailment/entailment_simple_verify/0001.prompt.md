You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, and there exists at least one valid permutation p that satisfies the given conditions.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [-1] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, holding the initial value of the input integer. The variable `mex` will be updated to the minimum value found among all elements in the list `p`. Each element `p[i]` will be equal to `mex - a[i]` for all valid indices `i`. The list `p` will have been fully modified according to the operations performed within the loop, ensuring that `mex` reflects the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p` as defined by the Mex function.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that for each \( i \), \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
   - \(\texttt{MEX}\) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   
2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes a list `p` with `-1` values.
   - It calculates the \(\texttt{MEX}\) value (`mex`) and updates the permutation `p` in reverse order.
   - For each index \( i \), it sets \( p[i] = \texttt{MEX} - a[i] \) and updates the \(\texttt{MEX}\) value to be the minimum of the current \(\texttt{MEX}\) and the newly set \( p[i] \).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic seems to be attempting to find the \(\texttt{MEX}\) and update the permutation accordingly.
   - However, the approach to calculate \(\texttt{MEX}\) in reverse order and directly updating the permutation might not always yield the correct result because \(\texttt{MEX}\) should be calculated based on the current state of the permutation, not just the remaining elements.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify with the provided examples:
     - For the first example: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \)
       - The correct permutation could be \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \).
       - Calculating \(\texttt{MEX}\) correctly for each step:
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0]) = 1 \Rightarrow a_1 = 1 - 0 = 1 \)
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) = 2 \Rightarrow a_2 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) = 2 \Rightarrow a_3 = 2 - 4 = -2 \)
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) = 3 \Rightarrow a_4 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) = 5 \Rightarrow a_5 = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
       - This matches the given \( a \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the \(\texttt{MEX}\) and update the permutation. It uses a reverse approach which can lead to incorrect results.
