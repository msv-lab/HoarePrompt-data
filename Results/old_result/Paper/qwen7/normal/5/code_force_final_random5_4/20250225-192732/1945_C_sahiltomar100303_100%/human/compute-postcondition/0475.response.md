Based on the initial state provided:

- `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `n + 1` + 1.
- `leftMove` remains 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `0`.
- `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `0`.
- `left` is now `0`.
- `mid` is `0`.
- `right` is equal to `n`.
- `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 for each '0' encountered from `mid` to `0`.
- `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1` if `s[0]` is '0'.
- `trightOne` is `trightOne - 1` if `s[0]` is '1'.
- `trightOne` is greater than half of `n - right + 1`.
- The condition `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2` is true.

We need to determine the value of `right` when the `print(right)` statement is executed.

From the initial state:
- `right` is equal to `n`.

Therefore, the value of `right` when the `print(right)` statement is executed is `n`.

Output: **n**
