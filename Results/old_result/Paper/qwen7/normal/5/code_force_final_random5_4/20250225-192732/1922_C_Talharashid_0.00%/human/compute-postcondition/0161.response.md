Output State: **`i` is `m-1`, `start` is `0`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `0`, `s2` retains the value it had after the last iteration, `s1` is irrelevant, `mini` remains unchanged, `d2[start]` is `0`, `d1` and `d2` are unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The line `end = len(lst) - 1` updates the value of `end` to be the length of the list `lst` minus one. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
