Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 2, `x` is either -0.5 or -0.0, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999998 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 with -100000000 appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Given that `x` was either 0 or 0.5, after subtracting 1, `x` becomes either -0.5 or -0.0 (which is effectively 0). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
