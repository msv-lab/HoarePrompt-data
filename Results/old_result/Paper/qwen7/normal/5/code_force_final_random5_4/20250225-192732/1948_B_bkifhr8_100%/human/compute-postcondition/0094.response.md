Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 2`, `m` must be at least 3, `arr[i]` is the last element of `nums`, and `nums` is a list of integers formed by converting each digit of `arr[i - 1]` into an integer and appending `arr[i]` to it.**

Explanation: The code converts `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and appends `arr[i]` to it. So, `nums` is updated to include all digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The value of `i` remains `m - 2`, and `m` must still be at least 3. The value of `ans` remains `False` because the code does not change it.
