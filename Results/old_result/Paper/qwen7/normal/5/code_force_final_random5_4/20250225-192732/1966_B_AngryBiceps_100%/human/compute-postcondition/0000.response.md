Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know from the problem statement that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `int(input())` will return a value within this range.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will run for as many times as the value returned by `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range. Additionally, since the loop is parameterized by this input value, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on this value.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the input value (which determines the number of iterations) is within the valid range.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Since the loop will run for `t` iterations, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range. Therefore, the state should reflect that `t` is a valid input value.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
