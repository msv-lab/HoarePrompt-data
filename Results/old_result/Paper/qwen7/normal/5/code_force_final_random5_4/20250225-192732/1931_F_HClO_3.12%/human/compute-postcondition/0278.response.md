Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 2.
- `a3` is the first integer from each input during the loop iterations, converted to an integer.
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input during the loop iterations, converted to integers.
- `val` is an empty list before the loop starts.
- The current state of `l3` is such that it does not contain any elements that are equal to `a3`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'no'` without any dependency on the values of `a3`, `l3`, or `val`.

Output: **no**
