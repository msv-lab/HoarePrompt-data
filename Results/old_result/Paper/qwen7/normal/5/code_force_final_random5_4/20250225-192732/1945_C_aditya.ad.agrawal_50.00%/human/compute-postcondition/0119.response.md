Output State: **All iterations of the loop have completed; `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`; `z_l` is equal to the count of zeros in `arr`; `o_l` is equal to the count of ones in `arr`; `z_r` is 0; `o_r` is 0; `ans` is equal to the last position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` were satisfied and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` holds true; `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` found during the loop's execution.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the position counter `pos` will be equal to the length of the array `arr`. The counts of zeros (`z_l`) and ones (`o_l`) in the array are stored in `z_l` and `o_l`, respectively. `z_r` and `o_r` are reset to 0 after processing the entire array. The variable `ans` retains the last position where the specified conditions were met, and `b_d` keeps track of the smallest distance found between `pos` and `n/2` during the loop's execution.
