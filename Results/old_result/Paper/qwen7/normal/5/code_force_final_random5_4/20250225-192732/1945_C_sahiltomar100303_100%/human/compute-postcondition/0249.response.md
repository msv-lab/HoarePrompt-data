Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0; `leftZero` must be less than (left + 1) // 2; `rightOne` is now one more than its original value; `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other conditions and constraints remain the same as the initial state. The value of `leftOne` is explicitly stated to be decreased by 1, so it is updated accordingly.
