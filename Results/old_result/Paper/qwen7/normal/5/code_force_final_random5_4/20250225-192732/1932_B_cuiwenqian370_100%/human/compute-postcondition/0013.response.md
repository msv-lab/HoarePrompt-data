Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `next_year` is (last_year + 0) // a[1] * a[1].**

Explanation: The code calculates `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(last_year + 0) // a[1] * a[1]` because `a[i]` becomes `a[1]`, and `1 + a[i] - 1` equals `a[i]` which is `a[1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
