Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is a positive integer (n // 2), `leftZero` is 2, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is assigned the value of `tleftZero + 1`. Since `tleftZero` is the same as `leftZero` (initially 1), after executing `tleftZero += 1`, `tleftZero` becomes 2. The other variables (`i`, `mid`, and the current value of `s[i]`) remain unchanged.
