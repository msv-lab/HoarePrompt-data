You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    #This is printed: -----------------
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: The `prefix` list will contain the integer 0 followed by the cumulative XOR of all elements in the `arr` list. Specifically, if `arr = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`, then `prefix` will be `[0, a1, a1 ^ a2, a1 ^ a2 ^ a3, ..., a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ an]`. The variable `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `n` remains an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The `arr` list remains unchanged as it was when the loop started.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the `prefix` list will contain 0 followed by the cumulative XOR of all elements in the original `arr` list, with each subsequent element being the XOR of all previous elements including the current one.
    print(arr, prefix)
    #This is printed: [a1, a2, a3, ..., an], [0, a1, a1 ^ a2, a1 ^ a2 ^ a3, ..., a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ an]
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 32; `pre[i][0]` is 32.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations (32 times), the variable `i` will be 32, and each sublist in the `pre` list will have its first element set to 32.
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
        
    #State: `i` is 0, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the total count of 1s in the binary representation of all numbers from 0 to 31 up to and including the `j`-th bit, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total count of 0s in the same range.
    print(pre)
    #This is printed: cur (where cur is the first element of the list `prefix`)
    print(suf)
    #This is printed: [(16, 16), (16, 16), ..., (16, 16)] (32 times)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        
        c = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
        
    #State: `j` is 31, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[32]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is the sum of `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][0]` for all iterations, `c` is `prefix[34]`, `i` is 34, `suf[j][1]` is 0 for all `j` from 0 to 31, and `pre[j][1]` is 32 for all `j` from 0 to 5 and 0 for all `j` from 6 to 31.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the provided data.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
