The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set includes an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, and `n` integers representing the elements of the array `a`. For each set, the function calls another function `func_1` with the array `a` as input and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case, formatted as a list of strings containing the result and the array elements.
