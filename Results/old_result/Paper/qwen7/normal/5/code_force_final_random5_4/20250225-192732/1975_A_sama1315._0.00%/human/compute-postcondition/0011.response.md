Output State: **`index` is 7 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list returned by `func_1(arr)`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`**.

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(arr)` assigns the return value of `func_1(arr)` to the variable `result`. Since the initial state of `results` was an empty list, it is now updated to the return value of `func_1(arr)`. The values of `index`, `t`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
