Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases, each containing three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each set of integers, it determines whether the sequence forms a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if the maximum value among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is \(b\)), or 'NONE' otherwise. It prints the result for each test case.**
