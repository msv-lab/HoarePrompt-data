Output State: **`i` is 5; `c` contains an element which is `a[5]`; `n` is 1 more than its initial value.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 5. The value of `c` remains unchanged as it contains `a[5]`. The variable `n` is incremented by 1, making it 1 more than its initial value. The precondition that `len(a)` must be greater than 5 is still valid.
