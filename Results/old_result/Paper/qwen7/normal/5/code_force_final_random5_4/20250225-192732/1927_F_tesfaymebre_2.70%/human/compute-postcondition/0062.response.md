Output State: **The `colors` list is initialized to `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros), all nodes in the DSU structure are merged into connected components based on the edges processed, the `_min_edge` value remains the same, the `w`, `u`, and `v` variables reflect the last edge processed, and the `dsu` object shows the fully connected graph with all nodes merged into their respective components; the `res` variable is the result of the DFS traversal starting from node `u` and excluding the parent node `-1`, and the traversal path is stored in the list passed as the third argument.**

This means that after executing the `dfs(node_u, -1, [])` function call, the `res` variable holds the result of the depth-first search traversal starting from node `u` and excluding its parent node `-1`. The traversal path is stored in the list passed as the third argument of the `dfs` function. All other variables and the state of the DSU structure remain unchanged from the initial state.
