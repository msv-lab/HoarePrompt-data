Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from input.
   - It then calls `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the final result.
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized to keep track of the balance at each position.
   - The balance is computed for each character in the string `s` and stored in the dictionary `d`.

3. **Computing Balance:**
   - The balance at each position is calculated:
     - If the character is '(', the balance increases by 1.
     - If the character is ')', the balance decreases by 1.
   - The balance is stored in the dictionary `d` with keys as the positions.

4. **Removing Last Position:**
   - The last position (length of the string) is removed from the dictionary `d`.

5. **Sorting Dictionary Items:**
   - The items of the dictionary `d` are sorted based on the balance (`x[1]`) in ascending order.
   - In case of a tie, the positions (`-x[0]`) are used to break the tie in descending order.

6. **Building the Result String:**
   - The sorted positions are iterated over, and the corresponding characters from the original string `s` are appended to the result string `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The balance calculation is correct and stored properly in the dictionary `d`.

2. **Removing Last Position:**
   - Removing the last position from the dictionary is necessary because the problem specifies that the balance of the entire sequence should be zero, and each prefix should have a non-negative balance.

3. **Sorting Logic:**
   - The sorting logic is correct. It sorts based on balance first and then by position in descending order for tie-breaking.

4. **Building the Result String:**
   - The result string is built correctly by appending characters from the original string based on the sorted positions.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
