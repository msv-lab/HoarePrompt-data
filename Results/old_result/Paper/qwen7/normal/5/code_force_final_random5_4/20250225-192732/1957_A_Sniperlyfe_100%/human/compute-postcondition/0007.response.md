Output State: The final state of `arr` will be an empty list since all its elements have been processed, and `freq` will be a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique element `n` from the original `arr`. Specifically, for each unique integer `n` in the original `arr`, the corresponding entry in `freq` will have a value equal to the count of occurrences of `n` in `arr`.

For example, if the original `arr` was `[3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2]`, then `freq` would end up as `{1: 2, 2: 3}`.
