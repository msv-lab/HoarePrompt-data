Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[1])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `c` is a list of integers created from user input, `c` is sorted in descending order. We continue the loop or process.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop or process continues, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
