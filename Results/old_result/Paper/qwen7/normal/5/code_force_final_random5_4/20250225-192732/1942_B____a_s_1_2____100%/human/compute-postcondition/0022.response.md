Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `mex` is the minimum of `mex` and `p[0]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of length `n` initialized to -1 for all elements, `mex` is now equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `n` to `mex`. Since `n` is an input integer, `mex` is now equal to `n`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
