Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the initial state, we know:
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `re` is `re + 1` (though this value is not needed for the print statement).
   - `res` contains `a[n-1]`.
   - `l[a[n-1] - 1]` equals 1.

2. The print statement is:
   ```
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. Since `i` is `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[n-1]`.

4. We also know that `res` contains `a[n-1]`, so `a[n-1]` must be the same as whatever `res` contains.

5. Therefore, `a[i]` (which is `a[n-1]`) is the value that will be printed.

6. The print statement uses `end=' '` to ensure that the next print statement will continue on the same line if there were any subsequent prints, but it does not affect the content being printed here.

Output: **a[n-1]**
