Output State: **`iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes an input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `a`. The value of `iterable2` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 1, and `x` is updated to the first input integer. The second input integer is assigned to `a`.
