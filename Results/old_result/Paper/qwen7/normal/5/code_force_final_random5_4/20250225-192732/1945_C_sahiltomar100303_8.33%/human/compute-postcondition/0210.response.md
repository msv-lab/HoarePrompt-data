Output State: **`leftMove` is 0, `left` is equal to `mid`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `i` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The line `leftMove = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftMove`. This assignment does not affect the values of `left`, `mid`, `n`, `i`, `rightZero`, or `rightOne`. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
