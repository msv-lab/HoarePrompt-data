Output State: **`cur` is an integer greater than `num` by less than 1.**

Explanation: Initially, `num` is an integer greater than `cur` by more than 1. After executing `cur += 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1. This means `cur` is now one more than its original value. Since `num` was originally more than 1 greater than `cur`, the difference between `num` and `cur` is now reduced to less than 1. Therefore, `cur` is now an integer that is exactly one less than `num`.
