Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `t` must be at least 3, `start` is 0, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1, `s` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `inc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

The variable `inc` is assigned the value 1, which is a specific value. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
