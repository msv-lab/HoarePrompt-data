Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This ensures that the number of additions and removals of cubes can balance out to result in exactly `m` cubes. Since this logic covers all potential cases within the given constraints, the program is correct.
