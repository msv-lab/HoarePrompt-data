Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has an error in its logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. The current implementation calculates `A` and `B` as the number of fireworks launched by each installation within `m` minutes and then adds 2, which does not correctly account for the overlapping visibility period of the fireworks.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the interval at which both installations launch fireworks at the same time. We then calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within this interval and adjust for overlaps.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Calculate LCM of a and b
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the LCM interval
        fireworks_a = lcm_ab // a
        fireworks_b = lcm_ab // b
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by both installations within the LCM interval
        fireworks_both = lcm_ab // lcm_ab
        
        # Total fireworks visible at the same time
        max_visible = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - fireworks_both + 1
        
        print(max_visible)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected function should provide the right answer by properly accounting for the overlaps and intervals at which fireworks are launched.
