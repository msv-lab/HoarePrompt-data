Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`: This function correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - `func_2()`: This function should read the values of `n` and `x` for each test case. However, the current implementation reads a space-separated pair of integers, which is incorrect because it should return a tuple `(n, x)` instead of a map object.
   - `func_3()`: This function correctly reads the permutation `p` and returns it as a list.
   - `func_4()`: This function is not used in the provided code.
   - `func_5()`: This function is not used in the provided code.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic attempts to find the position of `x` in the permutation using a modified binary search approach.
   - The logic correctly identifies when `x` is already in the correct position (`left`).
   - When `x` is not found at `left`, it checks if `x` is present in the remaining part of the permutation. If `x` is not present, it performs one swap. If `x` is present but not at the correct position, it performs two swaps.
   - The logic ensures that the number of swaps is no more than 2, which aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The main logic is correct and follows the problem statement.
   - The issue lies in the function `func_2()`, which incorrectly returns a map object instead of a tuple `(n, x)`.
   - The rest of the functions are either unused or do not affect the correctness of the main logic.

Given the above analysis, the provided program is almost correct, but it fails due to the incorrect implementation of `func_2()`.

Correctness: **False**
