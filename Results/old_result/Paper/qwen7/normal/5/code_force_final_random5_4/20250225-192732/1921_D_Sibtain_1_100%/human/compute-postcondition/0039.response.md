Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is max(`t1`, `t2`) + max(`t1`, `t2`), `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[0])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t2` to `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. Given that `j` is 2, `len(a)` and `len(c)` are both at least 2 (since `a[1]` and `c[1]` exist), `len(a) - j` is 0 and `len(c) - j` is 0. Therefore, `t2` is updated to `abs(a[0] - c[0])`. The other variables remain unchanged.
