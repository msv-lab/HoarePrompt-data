Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1, and the current value of `(c >> j & 1)` is true.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. The values of `c` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition `(c >> j & 1)` remains true as no changes were made to `c` or `j`.
