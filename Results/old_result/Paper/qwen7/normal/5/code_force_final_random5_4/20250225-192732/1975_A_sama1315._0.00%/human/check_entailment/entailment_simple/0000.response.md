### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It returns `'Yes'` if the array is sorted.
   - It returns `'No'` if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements where the first element is greater than the second.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function reads input data and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.
   - It calls `func_1` for each array and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

3. **Problem Statement Analysis:**
   - The problem asks whether an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - If the array is already non-decreasing, it can be made non-decreasing without any swaps.
   - If the array has a single "inversion" (a pair of elements where the first is greater than the second), it can be fixed by a single swap.
   - Otherwise, it cannot be made non-decreasing by any number of swaps.

4. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function correctly identifies if the array is sorted or if there is exactly one inversion.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `'Yes'`.
   - If there is more than one inversion, it returns `'No'`.

5. **Function `func_2` Implementation:**
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input data and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - The results are collected and printed correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` correctly determines if the array can be made non-decreasing, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.
