Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `t` is `n-1`
   - `l` is 'YES'
   - `c` is the input from the user
   - Either `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, or there is no else part since the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is the only one considered.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1 = 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1.

6. **Other Variables**:
   - `t` is calculated as `n-1`, so it will be `n-1` where `n` is greater than 1.
   - `l` remains 'YES'.
   - `c` remains the input from the user.
   - The conditions involving `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` will be checked again for `i = 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `t` is `n-1`, `l` is 'YES', `c` is the input from the user, and either `a[1]` is not equal to `c[1]` and `b[1]` is not equal to `c[1]`, or there is no else part since the condition `a[1] != c[1] and b[1] != c[1]` is the only one considered.**
