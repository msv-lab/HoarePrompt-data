Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start < end` is true, or `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` if `start < end` is false, and `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` if `start < end` is false.**

In this output state, the variable `start` is decremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial or previously described states.
