You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: The `letters` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are not digits, and the `digits` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are digits.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The `letters` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are not digits, and the `digits` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are digits. The `letters` list is not sorted.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The `letters` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are not digits, and the `digits` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are digits. The `letters` list is not sorted, and the `digits` list is sorted.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `i` is equal to `len(password) - 1`, and neither the `return` statement within the loop has been executed, meaning no 'NO' has been returned. All characters in the `letters` list are unsorted as they were initially, and all characters in the `digits` list remain sorted as they were initially. The `password` string has been fully iterated over without any condition inside the loop being met to return 'NO'.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, the function has gone through each possible pair of adjacent characters in the `password` string (from the first character to the second last character), checking if the current character is alphabetic and the next character is a digit. Since the function did not encounter such a pair, it means that no alphabetic character was followed immediately by a digit in the `password` string.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function returns 'YES' if none of the specified cases return 'NO', otherwise it returns 'NO'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'NO'

Case_4: The program returns 'NO'

Case_5: The program returns 'NO'

Case_6: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
