Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 3.
- `end` is 0.
- `inc` is -1.
- `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[len(lst) - 2] - lst[len(lst) - 3])`.
- `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`.
- `d2[start]` is assigned the value of `s`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while start != end:`.

### Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `start` is not equal to `end`.
- Given `start = len(lst) - 3` and `end = 0`, we need to determine how these values change within the loop body to ensure the loop can continue.

### Loop Body (Omitted):
- The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop will adjust `start` based on the value of `inc` (-1 in this case).

### Adjusting States:
- Since `inc` is -1, each iteration of the loop will decrement `start` by 1.
- For the loop to continue, `start` must not yet reach `end`, which is 0.

### Current Values:
- `start` is `len(lst) - 3`.
- `end` is 0.

### Next Iteration:
- In the next iteration, `start` will be `len(lst) - 4`.
- To ensure the loop continues, `start` must still be greater than `end`.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that needs adjustment is `start`. It must be greater than `end` (which is 0) in the next iteration.

### Final State:
- `start` must be greater than 0 (i.e., `start > 0`).

### Final Answer:
State: **`start` is greater than 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[len(lst) - 2] - lst[len(lst) - 3])`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, and `d2[start]` is assigned the value of `s`.**
