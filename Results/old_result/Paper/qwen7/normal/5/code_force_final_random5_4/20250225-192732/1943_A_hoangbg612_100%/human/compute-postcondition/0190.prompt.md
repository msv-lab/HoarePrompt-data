Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an input integer, 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    cnt = []
    for k in M.keys():
        if M[k] == 1:
            cnt.append(k)
    if len(cnt) >= 2:
        cur = cnt[1]
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary with all keys that were greater than `cur` at some point during the loop having a value of 1, all other keys having a value of 2, and the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, with `cnt` containing all the keys from `M` that had a value of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cnt` is a list containing all keys from the dictionary `M` where the corresponding value in `M` is 1. If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `cur` is equal to the second element of `cnt`. If the length of `cnt` is less than 2, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is equal to the second element of `cnt` if the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
