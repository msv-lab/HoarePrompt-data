Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n zeros where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for every `i` in the range of `n`, `r` is a list of n zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `l` will have each element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for every `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain as they were initially, except for `i` which will be equal to `n` after the last iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n`, `n` must be a positive integer, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
