Postcondition: `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 3)` or `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, depending on whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
