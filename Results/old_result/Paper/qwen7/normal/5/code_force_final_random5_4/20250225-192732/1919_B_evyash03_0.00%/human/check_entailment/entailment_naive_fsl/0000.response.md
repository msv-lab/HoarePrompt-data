Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the calculation of penalties for subarrays correctly. The function `func_1` is attempting to count the number of segments where the balance of '+' and '-' changes, which does not align with the actual penalty calculation required.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Explanation: The optimal way to split the array `a` is into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`.

However, the provided program would incorrectly output `4` because it counts the number of segments where the balance changes, rather than calculating the penalty based on the sum of elements in each segment.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
