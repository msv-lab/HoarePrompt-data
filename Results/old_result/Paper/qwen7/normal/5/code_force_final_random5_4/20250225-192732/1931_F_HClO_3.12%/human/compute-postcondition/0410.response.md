Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is an integer converted from the first input, `l3` is a list containing integers converted from the remaining inputs, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**.

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a1`, `a2`, and `m` remain unchanged.
