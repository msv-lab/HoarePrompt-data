Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list of sorted integers obtained from the third input split by spaces, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by spaces sorted in descending order.**

The code `c.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `c` in descending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
