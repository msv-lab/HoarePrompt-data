Output State: **`ind1` is 1, `ind2` is 0, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B', `outind` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is the second character in `inpstr`**.

Explanation: The line `ind1 = i` assigns the value of `i`, which is 1, to `ind1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
