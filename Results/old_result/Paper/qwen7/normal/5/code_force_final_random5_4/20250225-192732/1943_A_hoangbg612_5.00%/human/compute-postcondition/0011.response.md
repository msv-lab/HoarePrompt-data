Output State: **`cur` is now equal to 2, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `M` is an empty dictionary, and the current value of `num` is greater than the previous value of `cur` which was -1, and `num` is greater than the current value of `cur` which is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1, changing its value from the previous value (which was -1) to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
