You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m, where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}.
def func():
    """t=int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a,b,m=map(int,input().split())
        A=int(m/a)+1
        B=int(m/b)+1
        print(A+B)"""
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        a, b, m = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        ans = m // a + m // b + 2
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `qi` is \(t-1\) (the total number of iterations minus one), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `m` is the third integer input, `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`.
    #
    #This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `qi` will be equal to \(t-1\), indicating that the loop has executed \(t\) times. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be the same as the last inputs provided, and `ans` will be the result of the last calculation performed within the loop, which is `m // a + m // b + 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers a, b, and m, where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (t being the number of test cases). It returns different values based on the relationship between a, b, and m for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
