Output State: **`s` is 0, `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `x` is (n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. The other variables (`s`, `k`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
