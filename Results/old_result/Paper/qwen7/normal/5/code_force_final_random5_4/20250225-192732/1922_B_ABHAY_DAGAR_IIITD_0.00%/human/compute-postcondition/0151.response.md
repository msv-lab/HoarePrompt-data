Postcondition: `total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. If `cnt` is at least 2, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * total_count // 2` to its current value, and `total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.
