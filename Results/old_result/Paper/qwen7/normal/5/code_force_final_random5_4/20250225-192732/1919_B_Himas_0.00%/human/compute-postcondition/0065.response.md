Output State: **`e` must contain at least one character, `P` is 2, `M` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `len(e) + 1`, `q` is the second-to-last character of `e`, `s` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `P` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `e`, `M`, `i`, `q`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
