You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases, each containing three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each set of integers, it determines whether the sequence forms a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if the maximum value among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is \(b\)), or 'NONE' otherwise. It prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the middle digit `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, which would form a peak. For example, consider the input `4 5 7`. According to the problem description, this should be classified as a "STAIR", but the program incorrectly classifies it as "STAIR" instead of checking if it forms a peak. Specifically, the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is not sufficient to determine a peak, as it does not account for the case where `b` is the peak and `a` and `c` are smaller. Therefore, the program fails to correctly classify such cases.
