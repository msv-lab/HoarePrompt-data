Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Good Array Definition**:
   - An array \(a\) of length \(m\) is considered good if there exists an integer array \(b\) of length \(m\) such that:
     - \(\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum_{i=1}^{m} b_i\)
     - \(a_i \neq b_i\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\)
     - \(b_i > 0\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\)

2. **Subarray Query**:
   - We need to check if a given subarray \(c_{l_i}, c_{l_i+1}, \dots, c_{r_i}\) is good.

### Given Program Analysis
The given program has the following issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never called after the initial `func_1()` call inside the loop.
   - This means the function body is never executed, leading to an infinite loop or unexpected behavior.

2. **Logic for Checking Good Subarray**:
   - The logic for checking if a subarray is good is flawed.
   - The current logic uses the count of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum of elements (`sumInRange`) to determine if the subarray can be transformed into a good array.
   - However, this approach does not correctly account for the necessary conditions for a subarray to be good.

### Correct Approach
To correctly determine if a subarray is good, we need to consider the following:
- The sum of the subarray must be even because each element in \(b\) must be positive and different from the corresponding element in \(a\).
- The subarray must contain at least two distinct elements to allow for the transformation into a good array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_good_subarray(nums, l, r):
    # Check if the sum of the subarray is even
    subarray_sum = sum(nums[l-1:r])
    if subarray_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    
    # Check if there are at least two distinct elements in the subarray
    distinct_elements = len(set(nums[l-1:r]))
    if distinct_elements < 2:
        return False
    
    return True

testCases = int(input())
for _ in range(testCases):
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    
    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        if is_good_subarray(nums, l, r):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
