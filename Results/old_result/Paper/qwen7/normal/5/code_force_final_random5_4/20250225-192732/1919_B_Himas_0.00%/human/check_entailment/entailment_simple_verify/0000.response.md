### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - We need to split the array \(a\) (represented by the string \(s\)) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray \(b\) is calculated as \(| \text{sum}(b) | \times \text{len}(b)\).
   - The goal is to minimize the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \(n\) of the string \(s\) and the string \(s\) itself.
   - It then counts the number of '+' characters (\(P\)) and '-' characters (\(M\)) in the string \(s\).
   - Finally, it prints \(P - M\).

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program does not split the string \(s\) into subarrays.
   - The program does not calculate the penalties for any subarrays.
   - The program simply outputs the difference between the count of '+' and '-' characters.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     +-
     -++
     --+
     ```
   - The expected output should be:
     ```
     0
     2
     4
     ```
   - However, the program will output:
     ```
     0
     1
     1
     ```

5. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program fails to implement the required logic of splitting the string into subarrays and calculating the penalties.
   - The output is based on the simple count of '+' and '-' characters, which does not reflect the actual penalty calculation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It only counts the number of '+' and '-' characters without splitting the string into subarrays and calculating the penalties.

**Final: False**
