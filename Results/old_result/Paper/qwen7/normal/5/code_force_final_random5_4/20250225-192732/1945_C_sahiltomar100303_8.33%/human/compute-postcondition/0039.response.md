Output State: **`i` is equal to `mid-1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid-1`, the current value of `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is incremented by 1**.

The code increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `i` is equal to `mid-1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid-1`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0', the only change is that `rightZero` is incremented by 1.
