Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is either `True` or `False`.
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - `m` must be greater than 1.
   - `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs `n` times.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop decrements `i` from `m - 1` down to 1.

4. **Objective**: 
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `_` (a placeholder for the loop counter) and `i`.
   - Since the loop runs `n` times, the state of `i` will be adjusted based on the decrement operation within the loop.

6. **Loop Decrement**:
   - Initially, `i` is `m - 1`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1.

7. **Final State Before Next Iteration**:
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be `m - 2` (assuming `n` is 1).
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes it.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `arr[i - 1]` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.

8. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be `m - 2` (if `n` is 1).
   - `ans` remains the same (`True` or `False`).
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `arr[i - 1]` remains the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`ans` is either `True` or `False`, `i` is `m - 2`, `m` must be greater than 1, and `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`**.
