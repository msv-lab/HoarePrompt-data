Output State: **`left` is `mid`, `right` is `n`, `t` is decreased by the total number of iterations, `rightZero` is twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1`, `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are unchanged, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are unchanged, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are unchanged.**

The code `leftMove = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftMove`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
