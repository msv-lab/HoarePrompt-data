Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case. This part is correct.

2. **Promotion Calculation**: The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which seems to be a typo. It should be `d = b / 2` instead of `d = c / 2`. This is because `b` represents the price for two yogurts, so `b / 2` gives the price for one yogurt under the promotion.

3. **Condition Check**: The program checks whether buying each yogurt individually at price `a` is cheaper than buying them in pairs at price `b`. However, the logic should consider both the scenario where all yogurts are bought in pairs and the scenario where some yogurts are bought individually to minimize the total cost. 

4. **Calculation of Minimum Cost**:
   - If `n` is even, Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs, so the cost would be `n / 2 * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, Maxim can buy `(n - 1) / 2` pairs and one yogurt individually, so the cost would be `(n - 1) / 2 * b + a`.

5. **Output**: The program should round the result of the above calculation, but the current implementation only considers the individual yogurt price `a` without considering the pairing cost properly.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the pairing of yogurts to minimize the cost. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, _ = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(total_cost)
```

Based on the above reasoning:

Correctness: **False**
