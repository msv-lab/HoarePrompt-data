The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables when `continue` is executed, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the loop iteration. The conditions and values of the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, and `maxa` stay unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`. The last elements of lists `a` and `p` are equal to the maximum value in list `a`.**
