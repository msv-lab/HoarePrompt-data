Output State: `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total % n == 0`, `mean` is `total // n`, `curr` is the sum of all elements in `nums` minus `n * mean`, `i` is `n`, and if `curr < 0`, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `curr` will be the sum of all elements in `nums` minus `n * mean`, because each element `nums[i]` is subtracted by `mean` exactly once during the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The function will check if `curr` is less than 0, and if it is, it will return 'NO'. Otherwise, it will continue without returning anything.
