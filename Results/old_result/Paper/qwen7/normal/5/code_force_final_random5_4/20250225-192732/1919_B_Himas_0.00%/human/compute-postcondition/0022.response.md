Postcondition: `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string that is two characters shorter, `q` is the last character processed from `e`. If `P` was 2 and `M` was 0, then `P` becomes 1, `M` remains 2, and `q` equals '+'. Otherwise, if `P` is 0 and `M` is 2, `P` remains 0, `M` becomes 1, and `q` equals '-'.
