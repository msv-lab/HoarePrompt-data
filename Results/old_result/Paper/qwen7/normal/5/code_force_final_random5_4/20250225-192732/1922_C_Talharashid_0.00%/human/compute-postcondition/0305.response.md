Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `t` must be at least 3, `start` is `start` - 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 3, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`) or `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`), `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with int type.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d1` as a defaultdict with the default factory set to `int`. This means that `d1` is now a dictionary that will automatically assign an integer value (defaulting to 0) to any key that does not yet exist when accessed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
