Output State: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '01', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'01'` to the variable `h1`. The values of `h`, `m`, `m1`, and `time` remain unchanged from their initial states.
