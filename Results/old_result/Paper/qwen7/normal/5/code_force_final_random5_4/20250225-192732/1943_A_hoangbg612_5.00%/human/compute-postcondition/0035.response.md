Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, and `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` updates the dictionary `M` to contain the key `cur` with the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
