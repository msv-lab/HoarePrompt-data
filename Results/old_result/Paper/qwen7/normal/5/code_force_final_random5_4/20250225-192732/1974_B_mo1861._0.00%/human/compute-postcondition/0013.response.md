Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for c in b:`.
2. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The objects in the loop head are `c` and `b`.
3. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is an empty string, but this variable is not involved in the loop head.
   - `b` is not specified in the initial state, so its state needs to be considered.

4. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `b`. If `b` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given that `s` is an empty string and not involved in the loop head, we only need to consider `b`.

5. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `b` must contain at least one element. If `b` is empty, the loop will not run.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `b` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`b` must contain at least one element**
