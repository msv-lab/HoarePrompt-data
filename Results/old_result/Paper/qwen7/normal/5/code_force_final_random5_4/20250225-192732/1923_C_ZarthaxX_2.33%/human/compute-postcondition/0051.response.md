Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `n+1`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of 1's encountered so far in the `nums` list, with the last element being the total count of 1's in the entire list. The `sum` list will store the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums`, adjusted by subtracting the count of 1's, with the last element being the final adjusted sum. `q` will be the total number of queries processed, and for each query, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` will be checked, printing 'YES' if true and 'NO' otherwise.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n+1`, the `ones` list will have the cumulative count of 1's in `nums`, the `sum` list will have the cumulative sum of `nums` excluding 1's, and the loop will have processed all `q` queries, printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on the given condition for each query.
