Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Specifically, the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities directly, rather than finding the cumulative effect of each sign occurring one after another.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 3 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The first sign occurs in year 2.
  - The second sign occurs in year 5 (2 + 3).
  - The third sign occurs in year 11 (5 + 6).

- Actual Output:
  - The program incorrectly calculates the LCM of 2, 3, and 6, which is 6. Thus, it outputs 6 instead of 11.

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the sequential nature of the signs occurring. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
