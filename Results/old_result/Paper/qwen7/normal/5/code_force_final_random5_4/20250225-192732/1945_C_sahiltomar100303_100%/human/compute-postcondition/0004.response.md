Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is the integer input of the user, `s` is the string input of the user, `mid` is the floor division of `n` by 2.**

The code calculates the floor division of `n` by 2 and assigns it to the variable `mid`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
