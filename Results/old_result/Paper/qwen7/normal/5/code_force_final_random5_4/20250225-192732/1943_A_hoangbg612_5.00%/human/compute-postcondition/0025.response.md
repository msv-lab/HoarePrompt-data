Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur+1` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 before the increment, or the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was not -1 before the increment, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `cur` is either -1 or equal to `next_num` (if `next_num > cur`) still holds true, but now `cur` is specifically set to the value of `num`. The dictionary `M` updates its key based on the new value of `cur`.
