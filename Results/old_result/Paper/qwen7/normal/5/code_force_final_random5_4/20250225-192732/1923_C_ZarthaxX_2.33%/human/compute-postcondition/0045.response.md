Postcondition: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers input from the user, and the final condition is either `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` or `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange`. Since the if condition checks if `l == r`, if this condition is true, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `l != r`, the else part does not execute, so the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.**
