Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `arr[i]` and `ans` remains False. If `arr[i] ≥ arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` remains True.
