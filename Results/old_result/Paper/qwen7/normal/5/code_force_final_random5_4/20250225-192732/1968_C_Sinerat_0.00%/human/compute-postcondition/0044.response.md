Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs defined by the constraints: a positive integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and a list `x` of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. The function returns nothing explicitly but processes these inputs according to the given constraints.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here as per the instructions, only the parameters and their constraints are outlined.
