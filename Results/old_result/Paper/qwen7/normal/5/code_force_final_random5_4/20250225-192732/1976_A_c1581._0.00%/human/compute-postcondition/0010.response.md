Output State: **`char` is appended to the list `digits`; `letters` remains the list of non-digit characters; `digits` is now a list containing all its original elements plus the `char`.**

This means that the `char`, which was originally the next character in the `password` string, is now added to the `digits` list, making it a list that includes all the original digits plus this new character. The `letters` list remains unchanged.
