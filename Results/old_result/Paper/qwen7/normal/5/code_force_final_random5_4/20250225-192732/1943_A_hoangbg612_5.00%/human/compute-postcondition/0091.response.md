Output State: **`cur` is the fifth element of `N`, `M[cur]` is set to 1 if `num` is greater than `cur-1`, otherwise `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Initially, `cur` was the fourth element of `N`. After incrementing, `cur` becomes the fifth element of `N`. The condition for setting `M[cur]` remains the same, i.e., it is set to 1 if `num` is greater than `cur-1` (which was the fourth element), otherwise it is incremented by 1.
