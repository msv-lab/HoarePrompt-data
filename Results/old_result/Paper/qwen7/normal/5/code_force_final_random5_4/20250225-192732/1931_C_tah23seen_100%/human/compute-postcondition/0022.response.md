Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between j and i minus 1 when j is 0 and i is the length of `arr`. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (the length of `arr` minus `i` minus 1) and `j`, and 0.**
