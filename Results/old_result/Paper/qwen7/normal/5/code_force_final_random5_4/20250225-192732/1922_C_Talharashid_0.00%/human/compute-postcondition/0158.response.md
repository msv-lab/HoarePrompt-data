Output State: **`i` is `m-1`, `start` is `-m`, `end` is `-m-1`, `s` is `0`, `s2` retains the value it had after the last iteration, `s1` is irrelevant, `mini` remains unchanged, `d2[start]` is `0`, `d1` and `d2` are unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
