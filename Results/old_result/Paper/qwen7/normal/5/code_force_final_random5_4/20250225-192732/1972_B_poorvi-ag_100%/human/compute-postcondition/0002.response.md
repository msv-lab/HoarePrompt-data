Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head consists of the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**: Since `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Consider the initial state of other variables**: The variable `results` is initially an empty list, and this does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
