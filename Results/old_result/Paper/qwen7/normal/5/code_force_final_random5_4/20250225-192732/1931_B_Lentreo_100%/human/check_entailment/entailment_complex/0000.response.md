Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the allowed operations.
2. The key observation is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, it is always possible to redistribute the water so that each container has an equal amount. This is because the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among the containers.
3. The provided code correctly checks if the total amount of water (`total`) is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
4. If the total is divisible by `n`, the code calculates the mean amount of water per container (`mean = total // n`).
5. It then iterates through the list of water amounts and checks if the cumulative difference between the current total and `n * mean` remains non-negative. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means the redistribution is not possible, and the function returns 'NO'.
6. If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means the redistribution is possible, and the function returns 'YES'.

Given the logic and the provided example, the function correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
