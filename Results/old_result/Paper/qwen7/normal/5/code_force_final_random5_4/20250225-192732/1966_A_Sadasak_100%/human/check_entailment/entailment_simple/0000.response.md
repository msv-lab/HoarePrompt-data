Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Card Count Handling**: For each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: If `k > n`, the program correctly prints `n` because no exchanges can be made.
4. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number, but caps the frequency at `k`. This ensures that no card number appears more than `k` times.
5. **Output Determination**:
   - If `k` appears in the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
- The function `func_1` does not return the correct frequency table for determining the final minimum number of cards. It only returns the frequency table, but the logic to determine the minimum number of cards is flawed.
- The program should consider the frequency of each card number and determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Calculate the frequency of each card number.
2. Determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further by checking the frequency of each card number.

Here is the corrected approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for freq in frequency_table.values():
        if freq % k == 0:
            min_cards += freq // k
        else:
            min_cards += freq // k + 1
    
    print(min_cards)
```

With this corrected approach, the program correctly determines the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand.
