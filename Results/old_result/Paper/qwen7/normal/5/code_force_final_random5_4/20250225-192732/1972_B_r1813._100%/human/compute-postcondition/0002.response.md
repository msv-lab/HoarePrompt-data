Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[0]` to `t`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial states.
