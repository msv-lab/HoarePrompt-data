Output State: **`j` is 2; `s` is 'b'**

Explanation: The variable `j` is initially set to 1. The code `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j + ord('a')` to the string `s`. Since `ord('a')` is 97, `j + ord('a')` equals 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'. Therefore, `s` becomes 'b'. The value of `j` is then incremented to 2, but since the question asks for the output state after the code execution, we only need to include the final values of the variables that have been changed.
