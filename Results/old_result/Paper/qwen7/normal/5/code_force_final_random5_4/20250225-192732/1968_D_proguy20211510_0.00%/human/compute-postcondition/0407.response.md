Output State: **`i` is 8; `sb` is updated to `sb + b[7]`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 7 to 8. The variable `sb` is updated by appending `b[i-1]`, which is `b[7]`, to itself. The initial state of `preb` is not relevant to the final output state since no operation affects `preb`.
