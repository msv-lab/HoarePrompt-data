Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty string `ans`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the length of `s` is still stored in `n`, and `s` remains unchanged. The variable `ans` is now an empty string.
