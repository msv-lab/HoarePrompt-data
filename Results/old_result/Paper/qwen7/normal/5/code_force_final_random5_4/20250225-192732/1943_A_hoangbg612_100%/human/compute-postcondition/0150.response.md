Output State: **`cur` is 1 more than the initial value of `num`, and `N` contains at least one element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `cur` or `N`, but it indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Therefore, the values of `cur` and `N` remain as they were in the initial state.
