### Reasoning

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This step is unnecessary for solving the problem correctly, but it doesn't affect the logic significantly.

3. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the counts of elements in `N`.

4. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the dictionary `M`:
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - It checks if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`. If true, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` where the value is 1.
   - If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second key in the list `cnt`.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.

#### Correctness Analysis

1. **Objective of the Game:**
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should try to include as many unique numbers as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should try to remove numbers that would otherwise increase the MEX.

3. **Logic Evaluation:**
   - The program attempts to build the array `c` by ensuring that consecutive elements are included only once.
   - However, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the distribution of elements between Alice and Bob.

4. **Example Test Case:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     4
     0 0 1 1
     4
     0 1 2 3
     2
     1 1
     ```
   - The output should be:
     ```
     2
     1
     0
     ```

   - For the first test case:
     - Alice can pick 1, leaving `a = [0, 0]` and `c = [1]`.
     - Bob can pick 0, leaving `a = [0]` and `c = [1]`.
     - Alice can pick 0, leaving `a = []` and `c = [1, 0]`.
     - The MEX of `[1, 0]` is 2.

   - For the second test case:
     - Alice can pick 0, leaving `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `c = [0]`.
     - Bob can pick 1, leaving `a = [2, 3]` and `c = [0]`.
     - Alice can pick 2, leaving `a = [3]` and `c = [0, 2]`.
     - Bob can pick 3, leaving `a = []` and `c = [0, 2]`.
     - The MEX of `[0, 2]` is 1.

   - For the third test case:
     - Alice can pick 1, leaving `a = [1]` and `c = [1]`.
     - Bob can pick 1, leaving `a = []` and `c = [1]`.
     - The MEX of `[1]` is 0.

#### Detailed Issues

1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the distribution of elements between Alice and Bob. It does not ensure that Alice and Bob play optimally.
   - The program does not correctly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Flawed Logic:**
   - The logic for updating `cur` and the dictionary `M` does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob play optimally, which requires a more sophisticated approach.

#### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
