Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than 0.

Given these points, we need to update the states accordingly:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
- `m` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

The other variables (`start`, `end`, `s`, `s2`, `d1`, and `d2`) are not part of the loop head and thus their states do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, and `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start < end` is true, or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` if `start < end` is false**.
