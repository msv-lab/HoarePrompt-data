Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, `l` contains three elements ['ans', `i`, `x // i`].**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains two elements `['ans', `i`]` because `i` is a divisor of `x` and `i` is less than or equal to `k`. After appending `x // i` to `l`, `l` now contains three elements: `['ans', `i`, `x // i]`. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged.
