Output State: **`rightOne` is 1 or 3, `rightZero` is either 0 or 1, `leftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is either 0 or 1, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightOne` is either 0 or 1, `leftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is `n // 2 + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. Since `rightOne` was either 0 or 2 initially, it now becomes 1 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
