Postcondition: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the original value of `res` plus the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is further updated by adding the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt` multiplied by `math.comb(cnt, 2)`.
