You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of string `s`. The list `d` will have a length of `n`, with each element `d[j]` representing the cumulative balance of parentheses up to index `j-1` of string `s`. Specifically, `d[0]` will still be 0, and for every `j` from 1 to `n`, `d[j]` will be calculated based on whether `s[j-1]` is '(' or ')'. If `s[j-1]` is '(', `d[j]` will be `d[j-1] + 1`; if `s[j-1]` is ')', `d[j]` will be `d[j-1] - 1`.
    #
    #This means `d` will contain the balance of open and close parentheses as we traverse the string `s` from start to end.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: The list `d` is empty, `i` is equal to -1, and `ans` is equal to the sum of all characters in string `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the sum of all characters in string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter s, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The function returns the sum of all characters in string 's'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of all characters in string 's'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
