The function processes multiple test cases, each involving three integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( x // n \), and prints this value. If no such divisor exists, it prints 1. Additionally, it finds the largest odd integer less than or equal to the square root of \( x \) and uses it to determine relevant divisors.
