Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` seems to be designed to generate a sequence based on a specific algorithm, but it does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all values of `X`.

For instance, consider the case where `X = 2`. The program should generate an array of length 1 with a single element `0`, because an array of length 1 has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element). However, the program outputs:

```
1
0
```

This is correct for `X = 2`. But for other values of `X`, the program may fail. For example, for `X = 5`, the program should generate an array `[0, 1, 0]` which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences. However, the program generates:

```
3
0 1 0
```

This is correct for `X = 5`. But for `X = 13`, the program should generate an array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences. However, the program generates:

```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```

For `X = 37`, the program should generate an array `[-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1]` which has exactly 37 increasing subsequences. However, the program generates:

```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```

The issue lies in the way `func_1` is implemented. It does not guarantee that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all values of `X`. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
