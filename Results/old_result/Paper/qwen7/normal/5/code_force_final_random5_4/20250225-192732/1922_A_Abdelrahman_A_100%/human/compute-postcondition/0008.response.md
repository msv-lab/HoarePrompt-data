Output State: **`no` is False, tests must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0; `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from user, `c` is an input string. The current value of `c` is either equal to `a` or equal to `b`.**

The variable `no` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables (`tests`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) retain their initial conditions as specified in the initial state.
