Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `reachable_first_row` remains `False`, `reachable_second_row` remains `True`, and `j` will be equal to `n - 1`. The value of `n` will be the last valid integer from the `test_cases` list that the loop processed. The state of `row1` and `row2` will reflect the final conditions checked during the loop's last iteration, but no specific values are provided for these rows beyond the conditions checked in the loop.

In simpler terms, after processing all iterations of the loop, the first row remains unreachable (`reachable_first_row` is `False`), while the second row remains reachable (`reachable_second_row` is `True`). The variable `j` will have reached the end of the row length `n`, and `n` will be the largest value from the `test_cases` list that was processed.
