Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence, but it does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. 

For example, consider the case where `X = 37`. The program attempts to generate a sequence using bitwise operations, but it does not guarantee that the resulting array will have the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `X`. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly map the input `X` to a valid sequence length and values.

A correct approach would involve generating a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences can be precisely controlled, such as using a sequence of repeated elements with gaps to achieve the desired count. The current implementation does not handle this requirement correctly.
