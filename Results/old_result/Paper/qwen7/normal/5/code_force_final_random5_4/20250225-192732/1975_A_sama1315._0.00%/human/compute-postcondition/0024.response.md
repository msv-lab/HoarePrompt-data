Output State: **`index` is 9 + n + 2 * n, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index - n:index])`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index - n:index])**.

Explanation: The variable `index` is incremented by `n`, so the new value of `index` is `9 + n + n + n`, which simplifies to `9 + n + 2 * n`. The values of `t`, `results`, `n`, `result`, and `arr` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
