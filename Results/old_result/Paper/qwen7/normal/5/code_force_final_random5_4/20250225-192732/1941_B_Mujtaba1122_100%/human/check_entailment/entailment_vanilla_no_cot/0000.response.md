Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The `func_2` function attempts to apply the operation by repeatedly subtracting `list[i-1]` from `list[i+1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i-1]`. However, the operation should only be applied when `list[i-1] > 0`, `list[i] >= 2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i+1] >= list[i-1]`. The current implementation does not check these conditions properly.

2. **Early Termination**: The function prints 'no' and returns immediately if any element other than the last one is non-zero after applying the operation. This is incorrect because the goal is to check if it's possible to make all elements zero, not just the first non-zero element.

3. **Final Check**: The final check with `func_1` is unnecessary and redundant. If the function correctly applies the operations, the final check should naturally be handled within the loop.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_make_zero(t, arrays):
    for arr in arrays:
        n = len(arr)
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            while arr[i] > 1 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
                if arr[i - 1] <= arr[i] // 2 and arr[i + 1] >= arr[i - 1]:
                    arr[i + 1] -= arr[i - 1]
                    arr[i] -= 2 * arr[i - 1]
                    arr[i - 1] -= arr[i - 1]
                else:
                    break
        if func_1(arr, n):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

def func_1(arr, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage
t = int(input())
arrays = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arrays.append(arr)

can_make_zero(t, arrays)
```

This corrected version ensures that the operations are applied correctly and checks if all elements can be made zero without prematurely terminating the process.
