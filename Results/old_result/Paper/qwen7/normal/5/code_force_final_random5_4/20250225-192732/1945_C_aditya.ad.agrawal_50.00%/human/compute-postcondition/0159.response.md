Postcondition: `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is the previous value of `z_r` minus 1, `o_r` is 0, `o_l` is either 1 greater than its previous value or increased by 1, depending on whether `i` is 0, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, and `ans` is 0 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `ans` is 1.
