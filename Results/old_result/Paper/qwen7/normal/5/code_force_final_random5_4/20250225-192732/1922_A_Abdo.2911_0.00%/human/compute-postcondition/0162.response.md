Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `2 * n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2 * n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `2 * n + 1`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1, it remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` becomes `2 * n + 1`.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1**
