Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len_unique`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len_unique`. Therefore, the loop will start and continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `len_unique`.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.
   - `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`.
   - `char_map` is an empty dictionary.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` should start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - `len_unique` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and `len_unique` is greater than 0.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 0 (initial value).
- `len_unique` must be greater than 0.

So, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `len_unique` must be greater than 0**
