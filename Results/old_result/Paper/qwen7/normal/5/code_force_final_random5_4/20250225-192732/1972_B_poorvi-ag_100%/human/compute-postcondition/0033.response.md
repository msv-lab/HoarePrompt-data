Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in results:`. This means the loop variable is `i` and the iterable is `results`.

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The only variables mentioned in the loop head are `i` and `results`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `results` that can be assigned to `i`.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - We don't have specific values for `i` or `results` given, but we know that the loop has just completed an iteration.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the presence of elements in `results`, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the current element in `results`, and `results` would have been updated (likely by removing the processed element).

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will take the value of the next element in `results`.
   - `results` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is the next element in `results`, `results` must have at least one element remaining**.
