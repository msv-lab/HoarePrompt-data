Postcondition: `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than half of `mid + 1`, and `rightOne` must be less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`.
