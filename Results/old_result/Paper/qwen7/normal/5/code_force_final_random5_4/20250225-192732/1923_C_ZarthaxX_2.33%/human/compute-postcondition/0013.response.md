Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `i` is n, `ones[n]` is `ones[n-1] + (1 if nums[n-1] == 1 else 0)`, `sum[n+1]` is `sum[n] + nums[n] - 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `ones` list will have been updated for all indices up to `n`, with the last update being based on the value of `nums[n-1]`. Similarly, the `sum` list will have been updated for all indices up to `n+1`, with the last update being based on the value of `nums[n]`.
