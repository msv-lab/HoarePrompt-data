Output State: **`i` is 2, `d[1]` is 1 if `s[1]` is '(', otherwise `d[1]` is `d[0]` - 1, and `d[2]` is either 2 if `s[1]` is '(', or `d[1]` - 1 if `s[1]` is not '(', and `d[3]` is `d[2] + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the dictionary `d` such that `d[3]` is set to `d[2] + 1`. Given the initial conditions, `i` remains 2, `d[1]` is determined by whether `s[1]` is '(', and `d[2]` is either 2 if `s[1]` is '(', or `d[1] - 1` if `s[1]` is not '('. After executing the code, `d[3]` is calculated as `d[2] + 1`.
