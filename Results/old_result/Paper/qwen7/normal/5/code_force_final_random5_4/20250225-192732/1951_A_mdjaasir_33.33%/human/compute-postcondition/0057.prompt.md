Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, `t` must be greater than 0, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer. If `count` is 0, then `i` remains 0. Otherwise, if `count` is greater than 2 and even, `count` remains unchanged and `i` is set to the index of the first '1' in `a` such that the next character after the first '1' is not '1'. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged and `i` is set to the index of the first '1' in `a` under the conditions that either it is the last index of '1' in `a` or there is at least one '1' in `a` and the character following the first '1' is also '1', or `count` is not equal to 2 and `count` is not odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If `count` is 0, no specific changes are made. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, no specific changes are made. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `count` is the number of '1's in the input string `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is an input integer. If the first '1' in the string `a` is followed by another '1', `count` remains the same as before the if-else block. Otherwise, `count` remains the same as before the if-else block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
