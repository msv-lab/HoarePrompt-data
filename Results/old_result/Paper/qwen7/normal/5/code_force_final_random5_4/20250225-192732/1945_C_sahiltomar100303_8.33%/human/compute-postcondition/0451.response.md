Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s`. If `right` equals `n`, then `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `tleftOne` are updated based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered from the initial `right` to the end of the string, and the condition `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2` holds as is or not. If `right` does not equal `n`, then `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `tleftOne` are updated based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered as described, and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is compared to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.**
