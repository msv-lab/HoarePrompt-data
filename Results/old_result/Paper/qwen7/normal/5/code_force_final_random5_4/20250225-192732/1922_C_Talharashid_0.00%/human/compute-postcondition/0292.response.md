Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `start` is an integer entered by the user - 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` if `start >= end`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `start` and `end`. The values of `m`, `i`, `s`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged. The conditions for `s1` and `s2` depend on the relative values of `start` and `end`, which are now determined by the user's input.
