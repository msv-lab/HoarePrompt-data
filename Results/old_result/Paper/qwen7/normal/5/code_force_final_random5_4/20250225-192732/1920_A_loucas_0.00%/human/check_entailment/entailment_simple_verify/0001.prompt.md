You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `min(less) + (loop * (innerLoop - 1))`, `max(big)` will remain less than `min(less)`, and `num` will be equal to `max(big) + (loop * (innerLoop - 1))`. `big` will be a list containing all integers `a` for which `x == 1` was true across all iterations, `no` will be a list containing all integers `a` for which `x == 3` was true across all iterations, and `less` will be a list containing all integers `a` for which `x == 2` was true across all iterations. The variable `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop` for each iteration, and `x` and `a` will hold the last input values provided by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `innerLoop` will remain unchanged from its initial value.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - We need to process `t` test cases, where each test case involves `n` constraints.
   - There are three types of constraints:
     - `1 x`: \( k \geq x \)
     - `2 x`: \( k \leq x \)
     - `3 x`: \( k \neq x \)

2. **Processing Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`loop`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`).
   - It then reads the constraints and categorizes them into `big`, `less`, and `no` lists.

3. **Finding Valid Range:**
   - The program aims to find the range of valid `k` values that satisfy all constraints.
   - It uses `max(big)` and `min(less)` to determine the lower and upper bounds of the valid range.
   - It iterates from `max(big)` to `min(less)` to find the first value that is not in the `no` list.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where there might be multiple valid ranges.
   - The logic to find the first valid `k` value within the range `[max(big), min(less)]` is flawed.
   - The program prints only the first valid `k` found, but it should count all valid `k` values in the range.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - Calculate the intersection of the ranges defined by the constraints.
   - Count the number of integers in the intersection range that are not in the `no` list.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly count the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It only finds the first valid `k` in the range `[max(big), min(less)]` and prints it, which is incorrect. The program needs to count all valid `k` values in the intersection of the ranges defined by the constraints.
