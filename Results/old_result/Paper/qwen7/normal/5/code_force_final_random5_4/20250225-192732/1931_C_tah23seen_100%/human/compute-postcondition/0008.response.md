Output State: **`i` is 4, `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given that `i` was initially 3, after executing the code, `i` becomes 4. The value of `arr[2]` being equal to `arr[3]` remains unchanged as the code does not affect the array.
