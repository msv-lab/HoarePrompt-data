Output State: **`i` is `m-1`, `start` is `-m`, `end` is `-m-1`, `s` is `0`, `s2` retains the value it had after the last iteration, `s1` is irrelevant, `mini` remains unchanged, `d2[start]` is `0`, `d1` and `d2` are unchanged, `t` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `d2 = defaultdict(int)` initializes a new dictionary `d2` with default integer values (0). However, since `d2[start]` was already set to `0` before this line, and no other changes are made to `d2`, the only change is the creation of the `d2` dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
