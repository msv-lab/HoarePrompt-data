Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, and the count of 'U' in `arr` is even; results is a list containing 'no'**.

The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Since the initial state of `results` was not specified, we assume it was an empty list or not mentioned, and now it contains `'no'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
