Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is (0 + n) // 2, `mid` is (0 + n) // 2, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing the value (0 + n) // 2.**

Explanation: The line `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. Given that `mid` is initially `(0 + n) // 2`, `high` is now also `(0 + n) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
