Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, which is an integer within the range of 2 to 1000. Based on the value of x, the function returns either the value of y (where y is an integer such that x is divisible by y and 2 * y is greater than or equal to x), the value of y which is one less than the initial value of x, the value of y which is x - 2, or the value of max_val which remains unchanged from its initial state.**
