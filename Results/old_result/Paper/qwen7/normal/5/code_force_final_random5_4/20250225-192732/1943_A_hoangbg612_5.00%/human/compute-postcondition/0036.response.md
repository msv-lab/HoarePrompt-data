Output State: **`cur` is either -1 or equal to the next element in `N`, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, and `M[cur]` is 2 if `cur` was updated, or `M[next_num]` is 2 if `cur` was -1 and updated.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Since `cur` is either -1 or equal to the next element in `N`, the value of `M[cur]` will be 2 if `cur` was updated (previously it was 1), or `M[next_num]` will be 2 if `cur` was -1 and updated (previously it was 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
