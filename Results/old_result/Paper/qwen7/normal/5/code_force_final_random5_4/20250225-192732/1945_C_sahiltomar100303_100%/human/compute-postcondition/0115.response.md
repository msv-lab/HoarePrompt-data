Output State: **`right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`, `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. The conditions involving `right`, `n`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged as no operations affecting these variables are performed.
