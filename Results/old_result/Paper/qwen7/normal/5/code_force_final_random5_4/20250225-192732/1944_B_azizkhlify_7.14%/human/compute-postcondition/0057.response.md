Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], end=' ')`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Since `i` is `n-1`, it means `i` is the last index of the list `a` (assuming `a` is an indexed list).
2. The value of `a[i]` is the element at the last index of the list `a`.
3. Given that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, it implies that the element `a[i] - 1` exists in the list `l` and its value is 1.

However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified directly, but we know it is the last element of the list `a`. Therefore, the print statement will output the last element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[n-1]**
