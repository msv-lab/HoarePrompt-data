You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
            if y1 < y3:
                res = abs(y3 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y3)
        elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        
        print(res ** 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `a` times, where `a` is the initial integer input. After all iterations, the variable `res` will hold the result of the last calculation performed within the loop. Specifically, `res` will be the absolute difference between two specific `y` values based on the conditions provided, corresponding to the last set of inputs processed in the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `a-1` after all iterations, indicating the completion of the loop. All other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`) will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, `res` will contain the final calculated value based on the conditions given for the last set of inputs processed. The variable `i` will be equal to `a-1`, signifying the end of the loop. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` will reflect the last inputs provided to the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns whether the given coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
