Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 2`; `value` is `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`; `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `value` is defined as `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`.
- After executing the line `value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)`, the value of `value` is updated to `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`, because `size` is `i + 2`.
- All other variables (`i`, `size`, `number`, and `size_overlap`) remain unchanged.
