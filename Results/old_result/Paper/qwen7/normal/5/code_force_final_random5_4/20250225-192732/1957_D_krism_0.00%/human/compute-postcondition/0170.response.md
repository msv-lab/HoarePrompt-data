Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is either `prefix[32]` or `prefix[34]` depending on the value of `c >> j & 1`, `k` is 5, `y` is `arr[32]`, `ans` is updated by adding `pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0]`, `c` remains `prefix[32]` or `prefix[34]` depending on the value of `c >> j & 1`, `i` is now 34, `suf[j][1]` is updated to 0 if `c >> j & 1` is true, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is updated to `suf[0][0] - 1`, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1.**

In more detail:
- The value of `j` remains 1.
- The value of `c` remains either `prefix[32]` or `prefix[34]` based on the condition `c >> j & 1`.
- The value of `k` remains 5.
- The value of `y` remains `arr[32]`.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged from its previous state.
- The value of `i` remains 34.
- The value of `suf[j][1]` is set to 0 if `c >> j & 1` is true, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is set to `suf[0][0] - 1`.
- The value of `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1.
