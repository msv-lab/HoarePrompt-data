Output State: **`j` is 2; `n` is 32; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is 5; `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`; `c` is `prefix[1]`; `pre[2][1]` is 2; `suf[2][1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value of `suf[2][1]` is decreased by 1 from its original value. Since the original value of `suf[2][1]` was not specified, we assume it was 2 (as `pre[2][1]` is given as 2, and typically these arrays are initialized similarly). Thus, `suf[2][1]` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
