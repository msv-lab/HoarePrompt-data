Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
   ```
   The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the New Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `3 + 1 = 4`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < k`.
   - Since `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), and `i` is now 4, the loop will continue if `4 < k`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - The value of `i` changes from 3 to 4.

5. **Maintain Other States:**
   - The other states (`k`, `founds`, `s`, `b`, `ps`, `pb`, and `p`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with four elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\), `b` is a list with four elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]\) if `foundb` is True, or \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1] or a[pb - 1] if pb is used instead of ps]\) if `foundb` is False, and either `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `foundb` is True, or `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`.**
