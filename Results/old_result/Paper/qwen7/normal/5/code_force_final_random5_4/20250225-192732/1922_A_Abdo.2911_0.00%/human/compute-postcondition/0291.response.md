Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2, `match_a_b` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that either `a[2].lower()` equals `template[2].lower()` or `b[2].lower()` equals `template[2].lower()`, or if `template[2].islower()` is False, the program still breaks out of the loop with `match_a_b` remaining False.
