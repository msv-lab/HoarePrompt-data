Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `num` is the next integer in the list `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is the frequency of `num` in the list `arr` incremented by 1 and assigned to `k`.**

This means that the frequency of `num` in the list `arr` has been incremented by 1 and stored in `k`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
