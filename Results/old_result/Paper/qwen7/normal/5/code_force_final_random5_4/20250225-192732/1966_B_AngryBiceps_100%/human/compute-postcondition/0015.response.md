Output State: **`a` is a list with three elements, where the first element is the initial input provided by the user, the second element is the new input provided by the user, and the third element is the current input provided by the user; `first_row` is the concatenation of `first_row` and the first character of the last element of `a`; `i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 1; `last_row` is the last character of the new input provided by the user plus the last character of the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element of the list `a` to the variable `first_row`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` was previously 3, it is incremented by 1 due to the implicit loop or sequence of operations that would follow such a line of code, making `i` equal to 4.
