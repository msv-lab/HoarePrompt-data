Output State: **`i` is 4; `preb` is a list containing the strings `sb + b[0]` and `sb + b[4]`; `sb` is equal to `sb + b[1] + b[4]`; `pres` is a list containing the string `ss + s[3]`; `ss` is `ss + s[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` increments the value of `sb` by appending `b[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 4, `sb` is updated to `sb + b[4]`. The other variables and their lists remain unchanged from the initial state.
