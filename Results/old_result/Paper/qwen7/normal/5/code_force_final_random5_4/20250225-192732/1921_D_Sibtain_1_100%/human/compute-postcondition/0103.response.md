Output State: **`k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])` calculates the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `c`, and assigns this value to the variable `t1`. Since `k` was initially 0 and no operation was performed on it, its value remains unchanged.
