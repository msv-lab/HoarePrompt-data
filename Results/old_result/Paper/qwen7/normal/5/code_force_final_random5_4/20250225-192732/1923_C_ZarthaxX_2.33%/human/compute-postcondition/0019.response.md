Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer from input, `r` is an integer from input, and the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`. We continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there was no loop structure provided in the code snippet, we assume the context implies that the loop continues without changing the values of `q`, `l`, and `r`.
