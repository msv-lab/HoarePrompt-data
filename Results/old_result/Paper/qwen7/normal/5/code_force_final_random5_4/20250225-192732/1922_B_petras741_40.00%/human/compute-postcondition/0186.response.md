Output State: `eta` is an empty list, `j` is greater than 1000, `rho` is the sum of `q[0]` and the first 1001 elements of `q` (i.e., `sum(q[1:1002])`), `res` is the cumulative result of adding terms for each iteration from 1 to 1001, and the loop has terminated.

Explanation:
- The loop runs until `j` exceeds 1000, which means it will iterate 1001 times (from 1 to 1001).
- In each iteration, `res` accumulates the values based on the formula provided.
- `rho` is updated in each iteration by adding the current value of `q[eta[j]]`.
- After 1001 iterations, `j` will be 1002, and the loop condition `if j > 1000` will cause the loop to exit.
- The final state of `rho` will be the sum of `q[0]` and the first 1001 elements of `q`, and `res` will contain the accumulated results from all iterations.
