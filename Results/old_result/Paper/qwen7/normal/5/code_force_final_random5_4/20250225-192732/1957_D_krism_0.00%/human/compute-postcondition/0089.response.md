Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the total count of 1s in the binary representation of all numbers from 0 to 31 up to and including the `j`-th bit, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total count of 0s in the same range.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all 32 iterations, the variable `i` will be 0 because the loop decrements `i` until it reaches 0. The variable `n` remains 32 as it was initialized and not modified within the loop. The variable `cur` will be `prefix[0]` because the loop starts with `i` as 32 and decrements it to 0. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` will contain the cumulative count of 1s found in the bit positions from 0 to `j` across all numbers from 0 to 31, and `suf[j][0]` will contain the cumulative count of 0s in the same range.
