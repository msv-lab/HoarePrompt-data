Output State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string with its first character removed, `i` is the second character of `s`, `one` is either 2 or unchanged, `cost` is increased by `one + 1`**.

This means that the `cost` variable has been incremented by the value of `one + 1`. The value of `one` remains either 2 or unchanged, and the other variables (`s`, `i`) also remain in their respective states as described in the initial state.
