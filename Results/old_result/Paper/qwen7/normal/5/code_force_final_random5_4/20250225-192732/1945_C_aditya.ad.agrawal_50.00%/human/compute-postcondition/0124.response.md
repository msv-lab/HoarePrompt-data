Output State: **`t` must be a positive value, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `input_string = input()` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `input_string`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
