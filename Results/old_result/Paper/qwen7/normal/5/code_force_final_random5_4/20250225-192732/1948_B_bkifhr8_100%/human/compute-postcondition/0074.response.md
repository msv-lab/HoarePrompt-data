Output State: `ans` is either True or False, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than 1, and `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `m - 1` because the loop decrements `i` from `m - 1` down to 1. The variable `ans` will be False if at any point during the loop's execution, the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met and the numbers in `arr[i - 1]` are not sorted when placed next to `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` will remain True. The value of `arr[i - 1]` will be the first digit of the number formed by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` with `arr[i]` if the condition was met, otherwise it will remain unchanged as per the loop's logic.
