State: **`res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`, which means `i` will start from 0 and increment until it reaches `n`.
2. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`).
4. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0, as it is the starting value for the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (must be greater than 0) and `i` (must be 0).
