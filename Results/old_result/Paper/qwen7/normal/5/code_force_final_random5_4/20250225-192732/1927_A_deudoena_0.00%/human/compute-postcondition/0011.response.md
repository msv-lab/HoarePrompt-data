Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is defined by the variables `i` and `j`, where `(i, j)` is obtained from `enumerate(inpstr)`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ind1` is 0
   - `ind2` is 0
   - `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B'
   - `outind` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is the first character in `inpstr`

3. **Determine the Next Values for `i` and `j`**:
   - Since `i` is derived from `enumerate(inpstr)`, it represents the index of the current character in `inpstr`.
   - `j` is the character at that index in `inpstr`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are more characters in `inpstr` to process.
   - The loop breaks if `j` is 'B'.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `j` is the first character in `inpstr`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `j` will now be the second character in `inpstr`.

6. **Additional Constraints**:
   - `inpstr` must still contain at least one 'B'.
   - `ind1` and `ind2` remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.
   - `outind` remains 0 unless the loop breaks due to encountering 'B'.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ind1` is 0
- `ind2` is 0
- `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B'
- `outind` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `j` is the second character in `inpstr`

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B', `outind` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is the second character in `inpstr`**
