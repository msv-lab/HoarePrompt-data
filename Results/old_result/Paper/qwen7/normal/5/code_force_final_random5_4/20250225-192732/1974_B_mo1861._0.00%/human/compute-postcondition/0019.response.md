Output State: **`s` is updated by adding `char_map[c]` to its current value, `b` must contain at least two elements**.

Explanation: The code `s += char_map[c]` updates the value of `s` by adding the value of `char_map[c]` to its current value. The precondition that `b` must contain at least two elements remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `s` has been modified, and `b` still contains at least two elements.
