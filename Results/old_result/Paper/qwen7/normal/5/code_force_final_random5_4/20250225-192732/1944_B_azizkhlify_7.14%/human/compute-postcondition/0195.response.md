Given the initial state where `i` is 10 and `n` is at least 9, the variable `a` is not explicitly defined or initialized in the provided information. Since `a` is not defined, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the print statement will attempt to access `a[i]`, but since `a` is undefined, this will result in an error if the code were to run in a real environment. However, based on the format requirement and the information provided, we should focus on the part of the print statement that is explicitly described.

The print statement is:
```
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

Since `a` is not defined, we cannot provide a specific value for `a[i]`. Thus, the output will indicate that `a[i]` is being referenced with `a` not defined.

Output: **a[10]**
