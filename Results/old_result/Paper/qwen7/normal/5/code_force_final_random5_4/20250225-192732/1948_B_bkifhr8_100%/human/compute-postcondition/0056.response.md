Output State: **`ans` remains `True`, `i` is `0`, `m` must be greater than `1`, `arr[i - 1]` remains `nums[0]`, `nums` is `[nums[0]] + [arr[0]]`**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` by converting each character of the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` (which is `nums[0]`) into integers and appending `arr[i]` (which is `arr[0]`) to the end of the list. Since `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, the list comprehension `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])]` results in a list containing the integer value of `nums[0]`. Then, this list is concatenated with `[arr[i]]`, which is `[arr[0]]`. Therefore, `nums` becomes `[nums[0]] + [arr[0]]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
