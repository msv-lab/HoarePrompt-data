Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- `right` is an index within the string `s` and is not equal to `n`.
- `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` are updated based on certain conditions involving the characters in the string `s`.
- The current value of `left` is 0.

The `print(right)` statement will simply print the value of the variable `right`.

Since the exact value of `right` is not specified in the initial state, we can only refer to it by its name.

Output: **right**
