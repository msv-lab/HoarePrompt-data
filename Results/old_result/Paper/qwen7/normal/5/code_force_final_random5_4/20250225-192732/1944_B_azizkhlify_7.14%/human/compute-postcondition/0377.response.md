Postcondition: `res` is a list that contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, up to a maximum of `k` elements if `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, `res` remains unchanged, and `i` is the last element in `res` after the loop has executed all iterations. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then after all iterations, `i` is `2 * n`, and the values of `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` remain unchanged from their values after the third iteration.
