Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the array `a` remains sorted in non-decreasing order after inserting a new element and removing the last element. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

The program should propose two new problems with difficulties 800 and 1800, respectively, to make sure that `a_i \le b_i` for all `i`. However, the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the sorting issue.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            a.pop()
            a.insert(i, b[j])
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)
```

This corrected version ensures that the array `a` remains sorted in non-decreasing order after each insertion and removal operation.
