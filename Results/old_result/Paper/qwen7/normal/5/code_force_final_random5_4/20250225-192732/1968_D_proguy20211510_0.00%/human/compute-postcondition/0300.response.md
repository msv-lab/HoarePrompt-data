Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`
- The value of `maxs` is less than `maxb`

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Bodya'` without referencing any variables or objects from the initial state.

Output: **Bodya**
