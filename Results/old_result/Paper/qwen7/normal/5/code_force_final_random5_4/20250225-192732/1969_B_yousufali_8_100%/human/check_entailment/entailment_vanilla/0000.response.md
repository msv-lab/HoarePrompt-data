### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve a sorted string.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to count consecutive '1's and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - It iterates through the string:
     - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operations.
   - It simply counts the number of '0's followed by '1's and adds their positions plus one to the cost.
   - This approach does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the string "10", `func_1` will output 2, which is correct because a single cyclic shift is needed.
   - For the string "0000", `func_1` will output 0, which is also correct because no shifts are needed.
   - However, for more complex strings like "101011", the logic fails to calculate the correct minimum cost.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
