Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is '01', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, the current value of `h` is '01'**.

The code simply assigns the string `'01'` to the variable `h1`. Since `h` was already set to `'01'`, `h1` now also holds the value `'01'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
