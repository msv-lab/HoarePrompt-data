Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an integer from input, `y3` is an integer from input, `x4` is an integer from input, `y4` is an integer from input, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` and assigns it to `res`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain unchanged.
