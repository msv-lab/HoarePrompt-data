Let's analyze the given program step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The variable `kreker` is initialized with an integer value representing the number of test cases.
   - A loop runs for `kreker` iterations, where each iteration calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Inside `func_1`, two integers `n` and `m` are read using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - The condition `if n >= m:` checks if the number of moves `n` is greater than or equal to the desired number of cubes `m`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Checking the Logic

- The logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the condition `n >= m`.

- The function `func_1` is called `kreker` times, which matches the number of test cases, ensuring all test cases are processed.

- The input handling and output format match the problem statement requirements.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
