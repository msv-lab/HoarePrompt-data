Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Each cyclic shift operation on a substring costs the length of that substring.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function processes a single binary string `s` and calculates the total cost. It counts the number of '1's encountered (`n`) and adds `n + 1` to `ans` every time it encounters a '0' followed by one or more '1's. This logic correctly identifies the segments where a '0' is immediately followed by one or more '1's and calculates the cost of sorting these segments.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case. This ensures that each test case is processed individually and the results are calculated correctly.

Given the problem constraints and the functions provided, the logic in both functions aligns with the requirements. `func_1` correctly calculates the cost for a single string, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

Correctness: **True**
