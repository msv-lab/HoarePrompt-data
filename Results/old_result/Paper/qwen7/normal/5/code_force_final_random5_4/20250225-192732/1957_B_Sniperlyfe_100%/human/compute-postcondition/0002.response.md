Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros; `k` is decreased by `nums[0]`, which is equal to (1 << (`k`.bit_length() - 1)) - 1.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `nums[0]` from `k`. Given that `nums[0]` is equal to `(1 << (`k`.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, `k` is reduced by this value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
