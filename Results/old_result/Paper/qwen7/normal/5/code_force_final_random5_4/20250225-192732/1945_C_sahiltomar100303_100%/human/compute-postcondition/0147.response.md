Based on the initial state provided:

- `rightZero` is 0
- `leftZero` is 1
- `left` is 0
- `leftMove` remains 0
- `trightZero` is 0
- `tleftOne` is 8
- `trightOne` is 0
- `leftOne` is 2
- `right` is `n`
- `left` is equal to 0
- `tleftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2

The `print(left)` statement will print the value of the variable `left`.

From the initial state, it is explicitly stated that `left` is equal to 0.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0**
