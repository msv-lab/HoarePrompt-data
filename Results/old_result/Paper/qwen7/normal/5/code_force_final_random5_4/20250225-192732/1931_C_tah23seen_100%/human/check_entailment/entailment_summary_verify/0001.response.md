### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_1` has issues with calculating the minimum cost to make all elements equal. Let's break down the issues and provide a correct solution.

1. **Issue with Logic:**
   - The original function `func_1` does not correctly identify the most frequent element in the array.
   - It also does not properly calculate the cost of making all elements equal to this most frequent element.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to find the most frequent element in the array.
   - Then, we need to calculate the cost of making all other elements equal to this most frequent element.

3. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element.
   - Identify the most frequent element.
   - Iterate through the array to calculate the cost of making all elements equal to this most frequent element.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(arr):
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = Counter(arr)
    # Find the most frequent element
    most_common_element, _ = freq.most_common(1)[0]
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != most_common_element:
            current_cost += 1
        else:
            min_cost = min(min_cost, current_cost)
            current_cost = 0
    
    # Add the cost for the last segment
    min_cost = min(min_cost, current_cost)
    
    return min_cost
```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Frequency Counting:**
   - `freq = Counter(arr)` counts the frequency of each element in the array.

2. **Finding the Most Frequent Element:**
   - `most_common_element, _ = freq.most_common(1)[0]` retrieves the most frequent element.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Cost:**
   - Initialize `min_cost` to infinity.
   - Iterate through the array, incrementing `current_cost` whenever the current element is not equal to the most frequent element.
   - Reset `current_cost` to 0 when the current element is equal to the most frequent element.
   - Update `min_cost` with the minimum value between `min_cost` and `current_cost`.

4. **Final Cost Calculation:**
   - Return the minimum cost found.

### Conclusion:

The original function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal. The provided solution addresses these issues and correctly computes the minimum cost.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flaws in the function `func_1`.
