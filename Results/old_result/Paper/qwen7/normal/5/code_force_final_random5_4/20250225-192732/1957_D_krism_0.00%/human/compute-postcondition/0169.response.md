Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is either `prefix[32]` or `prefix[34]` depending on the value of `c >> j & 1`, `k` is 5, `y` is `arr[32]`, `ans` is updated by adding `pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0]`, `c` remains `prefix[32]` or `prefix[34]` depending on the value of `c >> j & 1`, `i` is now 34, `suf[j][1]` is updated to `suf[j][1] - 1`, and `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since `j` is 1, `suf[1][1]` is decreased by 1. Also, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1, which means `pre[1][1]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state.
