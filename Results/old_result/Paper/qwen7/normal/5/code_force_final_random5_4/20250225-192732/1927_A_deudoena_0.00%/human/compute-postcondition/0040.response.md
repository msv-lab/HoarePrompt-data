Based on the initial state provided:

- `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B'.
- `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`.
- `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr`.
- `outind` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` calculates the number of characters in `inpstr` minus the position of the last 'B' minus the position of the first 'B'.

Let's break it down:

1. `len(inpstr)` gives the total length of the string `inpstr`, which is `n`.
2. `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr`.
3. `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`.

So, the expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` computes the number of characters between the first and last 'B' (excluding both the first and last 'B').

Output: **n - ind2 - ind1**
