Postcondition: `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`. The value of `left` is 0, and if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the current state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.
