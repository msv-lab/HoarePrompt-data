Output State: **`i` is `n-2`; `n` remains unchanged; `mex` is updated to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The line `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum between its current value and `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`, the value of `p[i]` remains unchanged by this operation. The value of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
