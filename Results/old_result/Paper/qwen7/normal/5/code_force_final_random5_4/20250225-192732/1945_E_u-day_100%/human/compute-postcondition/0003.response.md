State: **`pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, arr is the result of the function func_2() call, i is 0** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function, so `i` needs to be set to 0.
- The loop itself does not depend on `pos`, `n`, `k`, or `arr` other than ensuring `n` is a positive integer and `k` is within the specified range, as these are used to define the loop's behavior but are not modified within the loop.
- Since the loop can only execute if `n` is a positive integer, this condition must be met.
- `k` being an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ensures the loop can run, but since `k` is not directly involved in the loop initialization, it doesn't need to be explicitly adjusted here.
- `arr` is the result of a function call and is used within the loop, but its state is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i` being set to 0.
