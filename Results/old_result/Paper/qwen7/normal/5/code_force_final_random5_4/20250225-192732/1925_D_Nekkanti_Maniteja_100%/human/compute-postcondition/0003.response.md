Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `i` is 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is assigned the value of the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `M`, `n`, `m`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The calculation of `c` depends on the specific values of `n` and `M`, but the exact value of `c` cannot be determined without knowing `n`.
