Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two positive integers n and m within the range 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, where n and m are derived from a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). It returns a value based on the relationship between n and m.**

This means the function indirectly accepts two parameters \( n \) and \( m \) which are derived from a single parameter \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \)). The function then compares \( n \) and \( m \) (both ranging from 1 to 100) and returns a value based on their relationship.
