Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is given by:
   ```
   while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
   ```

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `list[2]` is -1
   - `list[1]` is greater than 0
   - `list[3]` is greater than 0
   - `list[3]` is decreased by `list[1]`
   - `list[2]` is `list[2] - 4`

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The loop checks three conditions:
     1. `list[i] > 1`
     2. `list[i - 1] > 0`
     3. `list[i + 1] > 0`

4. **Current Values**:
   - `list[2]` is -1 (which means `list[i] > 1` is false)
   - `list[1]` is greater than 0 (which means `list[i - 1] > 0` is true)
   - `list[3]` is greater than 0 (which means `list[i + 1] > 0` is true)

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `list[i]` (i.e., `list[2]`) must be greater than 1.
   - Since `list[2]` is currently -1, we need to change it to a value greater than 1.

6. **Other Conditions**:
   - `list[i - 1]` (i.e., `list[1]`) is already greater than 0.
   - `list[i + 1]` (i.e., `list[3]`) is already greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `list[2]` to a value greater than 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2; `list[2]` is greater than 1; `list[1]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is greater than 0**
