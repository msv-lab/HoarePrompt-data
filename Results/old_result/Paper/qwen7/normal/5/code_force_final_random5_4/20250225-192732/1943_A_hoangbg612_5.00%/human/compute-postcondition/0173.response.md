Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `cur`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `cur - 1` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < cur`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3 and the loop runs until `i < cur`, the next value of `i` will be 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `cur`. Given that `cur` is greater than 3, `i = 4` will still satisfy this condition.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `total` remains unchanged as it was not mentioned in the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented to 4.
   - `cur` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`cur` is greater than 3, `i` is 4**
