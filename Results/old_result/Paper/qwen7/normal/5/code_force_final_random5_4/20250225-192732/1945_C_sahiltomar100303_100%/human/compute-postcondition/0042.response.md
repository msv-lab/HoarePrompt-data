Output State: **`rightOne` is increased by 1, and the character `s[i]` is not '0'.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The condition that `s[i]` is not '0' remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `rightOne` has been incremented and the character `s[i]` is still not '0'.
