Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n + (n - 1)`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter. If `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, `match_c` remains unchanged and the loop continues as normal. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`.
