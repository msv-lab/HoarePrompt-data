Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `n + 1` + 1.
     - This means `leftZero` is less than or equal to \(\frac{n + 1}{2} + 1\).
   - `leftMove` remains 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `0`.
   - `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `0`.
   - `left` is now `0`.
   - `mid` is `0`.
   - `right` is equal to `n`.
   - `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 for each '0' encountered from `mid` to `0`.
   - `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1` if `s[0]` is '0'.
   - `trightOne` is `trightOne - 1` if `s[0]` is '1'.
   - `trightOne` is greater than half of `n - right + 1`.

2. **Understanding Variables:**
   - Since `mid` is `0`, we need to consider the values of `s[0]` to determine `trightZero` and `trightOne`.
   - If `s[0]` is '0', then `trightZero = rightZero - 1`.
   - If `s[0]` is '1', then `trightOne = trightOne - 1`.
   - Given `trightOne > \frac{n - right + 1}{2}`, and since `right` is `n`, this implies `trightOne > \frac{n - n + 1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}`. Therefore, `trightOne` must be 1 (since it's an integer).

3. **Determine `left`:**
   - `left` is set to `0` initially.
   - There is no operation changing `left` after setting it to `0`.
   - Therefore, `left` remains `0`.

Given the above analysis, the value of `left` when the print statement `print(left)` is executed is `0`.

Output: **0**
