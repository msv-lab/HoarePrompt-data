Output State: **The program returns x + dx, y + dy, where x is assigned to a, y is assigned to a, dx is the first part of b split, and dy is the second part of b split.**

This means that the program returns two values: the value of `x` (which is the same as `a`) added to `dx` (the first part of `b` split), and the value of `y` (which is the same as `a`) added to `dy` (the second part of `b` split).
