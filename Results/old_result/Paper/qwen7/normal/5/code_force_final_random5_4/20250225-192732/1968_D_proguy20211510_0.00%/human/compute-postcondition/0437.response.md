Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxs` is the maximum value of the cumulative sum of `pres` from index 3 to the last index plus the contribution of `rem` for each element in `s`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value of the cumulative sum of `preb` from index 1 to the last index plus the contribution of `rem` for each element in `b`.
- `maxs` is greater than or equal to `maxb`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Draw')
```

This statement will print the string `'Draw'` directly.

Output: **Draw**
