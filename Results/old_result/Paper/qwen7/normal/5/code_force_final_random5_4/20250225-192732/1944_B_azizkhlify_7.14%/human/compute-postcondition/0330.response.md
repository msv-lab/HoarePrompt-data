Output State: **`res` is `[3, 5, 2]`, `l` is `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`, `a` is `[3, 4, 2]`, `i` is `3`, and `n` is `5`.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is `3` and `a` is `[3, 4, 2]`, the value of `a[3]` is `2`. Therefore, `res` becomes `[3, 5, 2]`. The values of `l`, `a`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
