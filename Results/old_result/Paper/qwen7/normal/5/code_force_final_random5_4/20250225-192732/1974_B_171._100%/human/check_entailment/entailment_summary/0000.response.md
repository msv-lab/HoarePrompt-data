Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the decoding process based on the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into individual components. This approach ensures that the input is processed efficiently even for large inputs.

2. **Processing Test Cases**: It iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary information (length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself).

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It first extracts all unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary (`char_map`) where each character is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the sorted unique characters list.
   - **Decoding**: It then decodes the encoded string by replacing each character with its mapped value from the `char_map`.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the decoded strings for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program correctly decodes the encoded strings according to the specified rules.

Correctness: **True**
