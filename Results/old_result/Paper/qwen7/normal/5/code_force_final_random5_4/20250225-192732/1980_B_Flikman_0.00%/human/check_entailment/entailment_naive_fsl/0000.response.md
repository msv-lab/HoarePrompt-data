Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes after sorting but still gets removed because there are cubes with higher values that get removed first. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  MAYBE
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this case, after sorting, the values are `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The favorite cube (value 3) is in the second position. Since `k = 2`, the first two cubes are removed, which includes the favorite cube. However, the program incorrectly outputs `YES` instead of `MAYBE`.

The program incorrectly assumes that if the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite value is less than `k`, and the total number of cubes with the same value as the favorite plus those with greater values is also less than or equal to `k`, then the favorite cube will definitely be removed. This assumption is not always true, as demonstrated by the above counterexample.
