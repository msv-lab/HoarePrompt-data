### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The solution provided uses a recursive function to construct the array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that results in a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to construct the sequence.
   - The function aims to build a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns `0`, indicating an empty sequence.

4. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function calculates the size of the sequence needed to achieve the target number of increasing subsequences.
   - It appends values to the sequence in a way that ensures the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - The function recursively constructs the sequence and adjusts values to ensure the correct count of increasing subsequences.

5. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values from `0` to `size-1`.
   - The function then recursively constructs the rest of the sequence and adjusts values to match the required count.

6. **Output Handling**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate the sequence and prints the length and the sequence.

### Verification:

- The logic in `func_1` seems correct for constructing sequences that yield the desired number of increasing subsequences.
- The base case and recursive steps are well-defined.
- The adjustments made within the recursive function ensure that the sequence meets the requirements.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Sequence Length Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the size of the sequence using the formula `(1 << size + 1) - 1`. This formula is used to determine the maximum number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with a given sequence length. However, the actual sequence construction does not always align with this formula, leading to potential discrepancies.

2. **Adjustment Logic**:
   - The adjustment logic within the recursive function is complex and may not always produce the correct sequence. Specifically, the line `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` might not always ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `number` is very large or very small. This could lead to incorrect sequences or infinite recursion.

### Conclusion:

While the overall logic of the function seems to be on the right track, the specific implementation details and edge case handling need to be verified. Given the complexity of the adjustments and the potential for errors, we cannot conclusively state that the program is entirely correct without further validation.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**

The program is likely to have issues with edge cases and the specific implementation of the sequence adjustments, making it incorrect in its current form.
