Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216, `idx` is 1**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 0. After executing `idx += 1`, the value of `idx` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
