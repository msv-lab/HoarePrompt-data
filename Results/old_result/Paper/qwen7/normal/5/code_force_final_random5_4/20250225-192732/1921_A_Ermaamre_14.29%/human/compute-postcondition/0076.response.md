Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is the first integer from the input split, `y2` is the second integer from the input split, `x3` is the first integer from the input split, `y3` is the second integer from the input split, `x4` is the third integer from the input split, `y4` is the fourth integer from the input split.**

The code calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns it to the variable `res`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain unchanged.
