Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `match_a_b` is `False`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
