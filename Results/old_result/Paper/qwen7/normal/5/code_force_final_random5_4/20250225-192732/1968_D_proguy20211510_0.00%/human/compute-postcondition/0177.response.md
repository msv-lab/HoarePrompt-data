Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` contains an element which is `(k - (0 + 1)) * maxa`, `s` contains an element which is `(k - (1 + 1)) * maxa`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `i` to `i + 1`, making `i` equal to 2. It also appends a new element to the list `s`, which is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given that `i` was initially 1, the new element added to `s` is `(k - (1 + 1)) * maxa`, or `(k - 2) * maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
