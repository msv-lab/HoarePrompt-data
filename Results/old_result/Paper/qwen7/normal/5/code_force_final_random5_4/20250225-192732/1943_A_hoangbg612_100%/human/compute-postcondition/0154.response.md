Output State: **`num` is the second element of `N`, `cur` is equal to `num`, and `M[cur]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the index `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Since `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[num]` is set to `1`. The values of `num` and `cur` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the updated value of `M[cur]` (or `M[num]`) is `1`.
