Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer
- The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2

We need to determine the value of `a[i]` to understand what will be printed. Given that `i` is 0, we have `a[0]`. Since `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it means `l[a[0] - 1] = 2`. This implies that `a[0] - 1` is the index in list `l` where the value 2 is located. Therefore, `a[0]` must be 3 because `l[2]` would be 2.

So, the code snippet `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[0]` twice, which is 3, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **3 3**
