Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` must be greater than 0 (though its specific value is not needed for the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4` are input integers.
- `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, `y4` are input integers.
- `res` is calculated based on the conditions:
  - If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.
  - Otherwise, if `y1 < y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.

The print statement is `print(res ** 2)`. To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the possible values of `res`:

1. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res = |y1 - y2|`.
2. Otherwise, if `y1 < y3`, then `res = |y3 - y1|`.
3. Otherwise, `res = |y1 - y3|`.

In any case, `res` will be an integer, and the print statement will square this integer.

Therefore, the output will be the square of the value of `res`.

Output: **res ** 2 (where res is either |y1 - y2|, |y3 - y1|, or |y1 - y3| depending on the conditions)**
