Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the year in which all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. However, the logic used to calculate `start_year` is flawed. Specifically, the formula `(start_year // a_i + 1) * a_i` does not correctly compute the next occurrence of the sign after the previous one has occurred. Instead, it seems to be attempting to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence, but it does so incorrectly.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the cumulative LCM of the sequence of numbers. The provided code initializes `start_year` to 0 and then updates it using the formula, which is not appropriate for finding the LCM in this context. The correct approach would be to iteratively update `start_year` to the LCM of the current `start_year` and the next `a_i`.

Let's analyze the provided execution summary and the given example to confirm the issue:

1. **Initialization**: `start_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **Loop through each sign**: For each `a_i`, the code updates `start_year` using `(start_year // a_i + 1) * a_i`.
3. **Output**: The final `start_year` is printed.

Given the example:
- For the first test case: `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - The correct LCM of these numbers is 36, not the result obtained by the provided code.
- For the second test case: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - The correct LCM of these numbers is 60, not 5.

The provided code does not correctly compute the LCM and thus does not produce the correct results.

Correctness: **False**
