Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `c` is an array of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^9\), `a` is an array of length `n+1` where `a[0]` is 0 and the rest of the elements are the integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is an array of length `n+1` where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[1]` is `x`, `i` is 5, `x` is 1 if `a[4]` > 1 else 2, `b[5]` is `b[4] + x`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b[i]` to `b[i - 1] + x`. Given that `i` was initially 4, after executing `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x`, `i` becomes 5. The value of `x` remains the same as before, which is 1 if `a[4]` > 1 else 2. Therefore, `b[5]` is updated to `b[4] + x`.
