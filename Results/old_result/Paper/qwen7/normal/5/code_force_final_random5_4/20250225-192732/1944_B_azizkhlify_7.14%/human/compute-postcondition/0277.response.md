Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` is `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, and each element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` has been incremented by 1 for every `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

This means that starting from `i = n`, the loop increments the value at the position `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` for each `i` up to `2 * n - 1`. Since the loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`, it will increment the corresponding elements in `r` exactly `n` times. Therefore, the final state of `r` will have each element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by `n`.
