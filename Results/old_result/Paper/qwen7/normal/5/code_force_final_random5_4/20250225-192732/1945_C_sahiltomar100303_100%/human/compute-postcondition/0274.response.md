Output State: **`right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 if `s[right - 1]` is '0', otherwise `trightOne` is decreased by 1, and `right` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `right` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain the same, but they now refer to the character at the position `right - 1` since `right` has been incremented. The other variables and their conditions are unchanged.
