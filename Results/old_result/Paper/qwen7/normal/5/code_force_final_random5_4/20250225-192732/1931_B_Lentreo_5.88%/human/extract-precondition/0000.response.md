Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the second line contains n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
