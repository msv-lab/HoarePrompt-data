You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces for each iteration, `d` is equal to `c / 2` for each iteration, and the program prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` based on the if condition for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying \( n \) yogurts under the given promotion. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the average cost per yogurt for the promotion (`d = c / 2`) and uses this to compare with the regular price. This approach does not always yield the minimum cost.

For example, consider the case where \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 11 \). According to the problem description, the optimal strategy is to buy three yogurts for 15 burles (since \( 3 \times \frac{11}{2} = 16.5 \), which rounds to 17, but buying three for 15 is cheaper). However, the program would incorrectly calculate \( d = 11 / 2 = 5.5 \), and since \( 3 \times 5 < 3 \times 5.5 \), it would print 15, which is incorrect.

The correct approach should involve calculating the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then handling the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
