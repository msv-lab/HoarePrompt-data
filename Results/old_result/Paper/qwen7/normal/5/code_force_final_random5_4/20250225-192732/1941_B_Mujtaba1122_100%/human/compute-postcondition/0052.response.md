Output State: The value of `list[3]` is reduced by 2 times the initial value of `list[2]`, then further reduced by the value of `list[3]` after the first subtraction, and finally `list[4]` is decreased by the initial value of `list[2]`. `list[2]` remains greater than 0 throughout the iterations.

To break it down:
- Initially, `list[3]` is decreased by `2 * list[2]` and then by `list[3] - 2 * list[2] - 1`.
- `list[4]` is decreased by the initial value of `list[2]`.
- `list[2]` remains greater than 0 after each iteration.

Thus, the final state will have `list[3]` significantly reduced based on its initial value and `list[2]`, and `list[4]` will also be reduced by the initial value of `list[2]`.
