Output State: **`i` must be less than `len(pres)`, `rem` is now `k - i - 2`, `ptss` is a list with an additional element which is `pres[i] + (k - i - 2) * s[i]`, `ptsb` is a list with one additional element which is `preb[i] + (k - i - 2) * b[i]`**

Explanation: The variable `rem` is updated to `k - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - i - 1 - 1` or `k - i - 2`. All other variables (`i`, `ptss`, `ptsb`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
