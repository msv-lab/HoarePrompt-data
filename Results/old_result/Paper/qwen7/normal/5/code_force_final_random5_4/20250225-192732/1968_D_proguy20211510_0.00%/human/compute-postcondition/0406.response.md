Output State: **`i` is 7; `preb` has the element `sb + b[i-1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given the initial state where `i` is 6, after executing the line of code, `i` will be incremented to 7 (since list indices start from 0). Therefore, `b[i]` corresponds to `b[6]`. The value of `sb + b[i]` is appended to `preb`. The initial value of `i` is updated to 7, and `preb` now contains the new element.
