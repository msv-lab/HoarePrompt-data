Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. Otherwise, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that they are not all equal (i.e., `a != b != c`), and the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `b` or not equal to `b`.
