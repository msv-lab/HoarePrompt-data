Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the given array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there are any elements that are out of order and returns 'No' if there are none, or 'Yes' if there are elements out of order.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed because it should return 'Yes' if the array is already sorted and 'No' if it is not possible to sort it by splitting and swapping, but the current implementation simply checks if the array is sorted without considering the possibility of sorting through the allowed operations.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The input reading and processing logic seems correct, but the core issue lies in `func_1`'s logic, which does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

3. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.
   - The given solution does not implement this logic correctly. Instead, it only checks if the array is already sorted.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
