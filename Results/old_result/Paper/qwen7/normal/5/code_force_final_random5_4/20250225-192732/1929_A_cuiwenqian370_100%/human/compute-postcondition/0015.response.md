Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `2 + n`; `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `array` is now updated to `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`**

Explanation: The code updates the `array` variable to be a list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function over the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n`. The other variables (`data[0]`, `index`, `results`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships to each other, but `array` now holds the new list of integers.
