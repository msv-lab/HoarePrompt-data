Postcondition: `right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is such that `tleftZero < (right + 2) // 2`, and `trightOne` is such that `trightOne < (n - (right + 1) + 1) // 2`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is set to `(right + 2) // 2` and `trightZero` is set to `trightOne - 1`. Otherwise, `tleftZero` remains unchanged, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.
