Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 1`
- `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` are the same as at the end of the previous iteration

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Value of `i`:** According to the initial state, `i` is `n + 1`.
2. **Value of `a[i]`:** Since `i` is `n + 1`, we need to determine the value of `a[n + 1]`. However, the initial state does not explicitly provide the contents of the list `a` beyond the fact that `a` exists and `i` is `n + 1`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[n + 1]` without more information about the list `a`.

Given this information, the print statement will print the value of `a[n + 1]` twice, separated by a space, but since we don't have the explicit value of `a[n + 1]`, we can only describe it in terms of its position in the list.

Output: **[a[n + 1]], [a[n + 1]]**
