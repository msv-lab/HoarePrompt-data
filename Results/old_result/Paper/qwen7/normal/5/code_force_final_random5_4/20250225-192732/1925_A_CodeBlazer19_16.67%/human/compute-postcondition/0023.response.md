Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 2, `k` must be at least 98, `s` is 'ùj', `j` is 196, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` (which is 196) to its current value ('ù'). Therefore, `s` becomes 'ùj'. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `k`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
