The code reads two integers `l` and `r` from input using `map(int, input().split(' '))`. This means `l` and `r` are now assigned the values input by the user, but the specific values are not known yet. The values of `onesInRange`, `sumInRange`, `q`, and the condition check remain unchanged.

Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are integers from input, and the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is compared with `sumInRange`.**
