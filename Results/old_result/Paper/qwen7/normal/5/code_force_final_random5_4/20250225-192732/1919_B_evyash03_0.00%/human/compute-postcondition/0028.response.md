Output State: **`expression` must have at least one character remaining, `balance` is 1, and `count` is increased by 1 if `balance` was already less than 0, and `char` will be the first character of the current `expression`.**

Explanation: The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Initially, `balance` is 0, so after executing this line, `balance` becomes 1. The other variables (`expression`, `count`, and `char`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
