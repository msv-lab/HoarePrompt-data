Output State: **The character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0'; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', this condition remains unchanged. All other conditions from the precondition also remain true. Therefore, the updated state includes that `rightOne` has been incremented by 1, while the character at index `i` of string `s` is still not '0'.
