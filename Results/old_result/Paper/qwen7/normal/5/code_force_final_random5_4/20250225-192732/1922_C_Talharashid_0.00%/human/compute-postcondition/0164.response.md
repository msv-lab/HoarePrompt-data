Let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the current state of the variables:

The loop condition is:
```python
while start != end:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Current states:
- `i` is `m-1`
- `start` is `0`
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `s` is `0`
- `s2` retains the value it had after the last iteration
- `inc` is `1`
- `s1` is irrelevant
- `mini` remains unchanged
- `d2[start]` is `0`
- `d1` and `d2` are unchanged
- `t` is unchanged
- `n` is an input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `start != end` must be true. Currently:
- `start` is `0`
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`

Since `start` is `0` and `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, the condition `start != end` is already true as long as `len(lst) > 1`.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the states of the variables to make the loop execute the first time.

State: **`i` is `m-1`, `start` is `0`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `0`, `s2` retains the value it had after the last iteration, `inc` is `1`, `s1` is irrelevant, `mini` remains unchanged, `d2[start]` is `0`, `d1` and `d2` are unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user**
