Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `d[1]` is 1 if `s[1]` is '(', otherwise `d[1]` is `d[0]` - 1
- `d[2]` is either 2 if `s[1]` is '(', or `d[1]` - 1 if `s[1]` is not '('

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(len(s)):
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.

2. **Variables `d[1]` and `d[2]`:**
   - These values depend on the value of `s[1]`.
   - We need to consider both possible scenarios for `s[1]`:
     - If `s[1]` is '(', then `d[1]` is 1 and `d[2]` is 2.
     - If `s[1]` is not '(', then `d[1]` is `d[0]` - 1 and `d[2]` is `d[1]` - 1.

### Updated States:
- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- The values of `d[1]` and `d[2]` will depend on the value of `s[1]`.

### Possible States:
1. If `s[1]` is '(':
   - `d[1]` is 1
   - `d[2]` is 2

2. If `s[1]` is not '(':
   - `d[1]` is `d[0]` - 1
   - `d[2]` is `d[1]` - 1

Since we don't know the exact value of `s[1]`, we need to provide both possible states.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `d[1]` is 1 if `s[1]` is '(', otherwise `d[1]` is `d[0]` - 1, and `d[2]` is either 2 if `s[1]` is '(', or `d[1]` - 1 if `s[1]` is not '('**
