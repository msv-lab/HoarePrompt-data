Output State: **`rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is either 1 or 2, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is either 0 or 2, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` could initially be either 0 or 1, after incrementing, it becomes either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged, including `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `left`, `leftMove`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `leftOne`, `right`, `mid`, `tleftZero`, and `i`. Additionally, the condition that `mid` must be greater than 0 remains valid.
