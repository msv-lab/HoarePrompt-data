Postcondition: `left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is adjusted by either decreasing it by 1 or remaining the same, `rightZero` is increased by 1, and either `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`. Additionally, `rightOne` is increased by 1 if `leftZero` was already less than half of `left + 1`, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` was not '0'.
