Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in its conditions for determining whether the digits form a "STAIR" or a "PEAK". Specifically:

1. The condition `elif a == b == c:` will catch all cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal, which should be handled separately but does not correctly distinguish between "STAIR" and "PEAK".
2. The condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` will incorrectly identify some cases as "PEAK" when they should be "NONE".

To fix this, the conditions need to be adjusted to properly handle the "STAIR" and "PEAK" cases while also correctly identifying "NONE" for other cases. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a > b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This version correctly identifies "STAIR" when `a < b < c` and "PEAK" when `a > b > c`. All other cases are identified as "NONE".
