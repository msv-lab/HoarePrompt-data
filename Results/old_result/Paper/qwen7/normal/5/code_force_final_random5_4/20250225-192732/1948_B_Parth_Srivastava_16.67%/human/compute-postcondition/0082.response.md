Output State: **`i` is 5, `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[5]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[5]` divided by 10 as an integer, `c` contains `[y, x]`, `n` is `n + 2`**.

Explanation: The code `n = n + 2` increments the value of `n` by 2. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `n`, we only know that `n` has been incremented by 2. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
