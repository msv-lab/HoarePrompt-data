Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `c`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over each unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
   - `i` is the index of the current character `c` in the sorted unique characters of `b`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` must contain at least one unique character.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `c` is the second unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
   - `char_map[c]` is assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, it means we have processed the first unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `c` should now be the third unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
   - The condition `b` must contain at least one unique character remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `c` will be the third unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
   - The condition for `b` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `b` must contain at least one unique character, `i` is 2, `c` is the third unique character in the sorted form of `b`, `char_map[c]` is assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`**
