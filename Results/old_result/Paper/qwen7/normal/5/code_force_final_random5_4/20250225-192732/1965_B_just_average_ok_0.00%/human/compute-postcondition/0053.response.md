Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 8, `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k-64, k+1, k + nums[3] + 1]\), `idx` is 3**.

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `nums` list. The new element is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`, where `idx` is 3. So, the new element is `k + nums[3] + 1`. Given that `nums[3]` is 128, the new element becomes `k + 128 + 1`, which simplifies to `k + 129`. This updated list is then assigned back to `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
