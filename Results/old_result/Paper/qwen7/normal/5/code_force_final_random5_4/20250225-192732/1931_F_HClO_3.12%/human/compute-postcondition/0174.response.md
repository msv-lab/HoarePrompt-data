Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will execute if `n - 1` is a positive number.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 (since `n - 1 >= 1` implies `n >= 2`).
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration, but its initial value is not critical as long as the loop condition is met.

3. **List the States That Need Adjustment**:
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are not relevant to the loop condition and can remain as `-1`.
   - `p1` and `p2` are not relevant to the loop condition and can remain as `0`.
   - `t` is not relevant to the loop condition and can remain as `0`.
   - `a1` and `a2` are not relevant to the loop condition and can remain as the first and second integers from input.
   - `l11` and `l22` are not relevant to the loop condition and can remain as lists of elements from `l1` excluding `a2` and lists of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - The only state that needs adjustment is `n`, which must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
**`n` must be at least 2**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`n` must be at least 2**
