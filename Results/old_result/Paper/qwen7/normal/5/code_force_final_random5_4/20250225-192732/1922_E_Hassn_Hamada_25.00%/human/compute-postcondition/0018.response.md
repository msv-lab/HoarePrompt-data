Output State: **`sequence` has its last element updated to `i+1` and `i` is now `i+1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `i` (which is `i+1`) to the `sequence`. Since `i` was previously incremented by 1, it is now `i+1`. The last element of `sequence` is updated to `i+1`, and `i` is also `i+1`.
