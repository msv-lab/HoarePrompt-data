Output State: `left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `right` is `mid` plus the number of iterations the loop executed, and `trightOne` and `tleftOne` are adjusted based on the characters encountered during the loop iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `left` will still be 0 or 1, `leftZero` and `leftOne` will each be either 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions and the loop's behavior. The `rightZero` and `rightOne` counts will decrease by one for each zero and one encountered respectively, starting from their initial values. The `right` index will be `mid` plus the total number of iterations the loop ran. The `trightOne` and `tleftOne` variables will reflect the cumulative changes in the count of ones as the loop iterates through the string.
