Output State: **`cur` is 1 more than the initial value of `num`, and `N` contains at least one element**.

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since `num` is the second element of `N` initially, `cur` starts from the value of `num`. After executing the code, `cur` will be 1 more than the initial value of `num`. The list `N` remains unchanged, containing at least one element.
