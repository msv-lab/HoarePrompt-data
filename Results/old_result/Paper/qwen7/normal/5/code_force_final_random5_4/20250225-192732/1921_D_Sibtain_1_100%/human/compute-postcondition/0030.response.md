Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ans` is max(t1, t2), `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1]), `t1` is updated to `abs(a[0] - c[0])**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` to `abs(a[0] - c[0])`. Since `i` is initially 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]` and `c[i]` is `c[0]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
