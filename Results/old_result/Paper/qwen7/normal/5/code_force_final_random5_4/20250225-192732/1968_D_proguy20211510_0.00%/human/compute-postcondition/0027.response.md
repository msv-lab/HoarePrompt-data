Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code initializes two boolean variables, `founds` and `foundb`, both set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
