Output State: **`count` is `x`, `T` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is `x-2`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, and `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their previous values are preserved.
