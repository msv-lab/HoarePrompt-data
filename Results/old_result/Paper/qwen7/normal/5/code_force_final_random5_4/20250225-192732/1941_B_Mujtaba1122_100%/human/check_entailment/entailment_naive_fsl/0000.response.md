Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros properly. 

Consider the following test case:
```
5
2 4 4 5 1
```

- Initially, the array is `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`.
- Applying the operation at `i=2` results in `[2, 2, 2, 3, 1]`.
- Applying the operation at `i=2` again results in `[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]`.
- Applying the operation at `i=3` results in `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`.

At this point, no further operations can reduce the array to all zeros because there is no valid `i` that satisfies the conditions of the operation. However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" in this case.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that after each operation, the array can still be reduced to all zeros. This requires checking if the remaining elements can be reduced to zero after each operation, which is not currently implemented in the given code.
