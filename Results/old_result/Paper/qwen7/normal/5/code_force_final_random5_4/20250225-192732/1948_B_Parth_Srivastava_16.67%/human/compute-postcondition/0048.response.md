Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is converted to a list of integers where each integer is from the split string representation of `a`, `x` is the last digit of `a[0]` if `a[0]` is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is 1 if `a[0]` is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is 2 if `a[0]` is greater than 10, otherwise `n` is 1, `c` is a list containing either the values 0 and `x` or the element `a[i]` if `a[0]` is greater than 10, otherwise `c` is a list containing the element `a[i]`, `i` is 0, and `len(a)` is greater than 0.
