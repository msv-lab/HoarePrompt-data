Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`.**

Explanation: The code `maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)` calculates the maximum value from the list `ptss` and assigns it to `maxs`, and calculates the maximum value from the list `ptsb` and assigns it to `maxb`. The lists `ptss` and `ptsb` are not altered by this operation; they retain their original structure and values. The other variables (`i`, `rem`, `ptss`, and `ptsb`) remain unchanged in terms of their references, though their contents may now be indirectly referenced through `maxs` and `maxb`.
