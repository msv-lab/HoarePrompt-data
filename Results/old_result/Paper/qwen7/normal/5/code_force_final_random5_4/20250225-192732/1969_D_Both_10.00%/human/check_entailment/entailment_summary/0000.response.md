### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where Alice selects a subset of items to buy.
   - Bob then takes some items for free depending on the number of items Alice bought.
   - Alice's profit is calculated as the difference between what Bob pays her and what she spends buying the items.
   - Both Alice and Bob act optimally to maximize and minimize Alice's profit, respectively.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the price arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It sorts the items based on the price for Bob (`b`).
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the items that Bob might take for free.
   - It iterates through the sorted items and calculates the maximum possible profit for Alice.

3. **Key Points in the Code:**
   - The code correctly initializes the necessary variables and structures.
   - It handles the sorting of items based on Bob's price.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently manage the items that Bob might take for free.
   - The logic for calculating the maximum profit is sound and follows the optimal strategy for both players.

4. **Function Breakdown:**
   - **func_1:** Reads the number of test cases and returns it.
   - **func_2:** Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - **func_3:** Calculates the sum of certain pairs based on conditions, but it is used in the context of the main logic.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The code handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as when Alice buys fewer than `k` items or when the items are processed in the optimal order.

Given the analysis, the code correctly implements the logic to find the optimal profit for Alice under the given constraints and rules.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
