Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is `x - 2`, `max_val` is `x - 2`**

Explanation: The line `max_val = y` assigns the value of `y` (which is `x - 2`) to `max_val`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `x` is an integer, `y` is `x - 2`, and `max_val` is now also `x - 2`.
