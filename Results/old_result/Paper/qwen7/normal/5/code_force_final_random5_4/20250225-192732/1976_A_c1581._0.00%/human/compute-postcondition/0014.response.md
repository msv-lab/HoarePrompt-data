Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for char in password:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `char`, which is the current character being processed from the `password` string.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue executing, `char` must be a valid character from the `password` string. This means that there should still be characters left in the `password` string to process.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**: Since the loop processes each character in the `password` string, the `char` variable will be updated to the next character in the `password` string. The lists `digits` and `letters` will remain unchanged as per the postcondition given.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `char` is the next character in the `password` string.
- `digits` is the list of digits.
- `letters` is the list of non-digit characters.

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the `password` string.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
- `char` is the next character in the `password` string.
- `digits` remains the same.
- `letters` remains the same.

State: **`char` is the next character in the `password` string, `digits` is the list of digits, and `letters` is the list of non-digit characters.**
