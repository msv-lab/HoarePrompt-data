The code `size += 1` increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` is `i + 2`. Since `i` is the maximum value in the sequence minus 1, the value of `size` is `i + 2`. After incrementing `size` by 1, the new value of `size` will be `(i + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `i + 3`.

The values of the other variables (`i`, `value`, and `number`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence minus 1; `size` is `i + 3`; `value` is `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`; `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\)**
