Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `N.sort()` sorts the list `N` in ascending order. The values of `T` and `S` remain unchanged. The list `N` is updated to be sorted.
