Output State: **`a` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 6`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
