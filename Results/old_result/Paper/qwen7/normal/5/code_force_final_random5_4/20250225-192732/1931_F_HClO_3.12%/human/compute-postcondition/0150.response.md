Output State: **The list `val` contains exactly `m-2` tuples, each of the form `(a3, l3)`. The variable `m` is greater than 2, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, and `p2` is either 0 or 1. After all iterations of the loop, no `l3` in any tuple within `val` is found to be different from a list of elements in `l` that excludes all instances of `a3`. Therefore, the loop does not break, and it prints 'yes' after completing all iterations.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the list `val` will contain exactly `m-2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers. The other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`) will retain their initial values, and the loop will continue to check all tuples in `val` without breaking, leading to the final output of 'yes'.
