Output State: **`i` is 4 * n, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be less than n, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `template` has appended `a[i].upper()`**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i].upper()` to the `template` list. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 4 * n, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be less than n, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. After executing the code, `template` will contain the uppercase version of `a[i]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
