Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a` is greater than 5
   - `i` is equal to `a - 2`
   - `b[3]` is 0
   - `b[4]` is equal to \(-6 \times (a-5)\)
   - `b[5]` is equal to \(-6 \times (a-5)\)
   - All elements `b[i]` for `i` from 0 to 2 are 0.

2. **Loop Statement**: The loop runs as follows:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates based on the input value, which is an integer. Let's denote this integer as `k`.

4. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head does not involve any specific variables directly manipulated within the loop. The loop simply iterates `k` times.

5. **Adjusting States**: Since the loop does not modify any specific variables directly, the only variables that need adjustment are those mentioned in the loop head. However, since the loop head does not specify any variables, no adjustments are needed for the variables `t`, `a`, `i`, `b[3]`, `b[4]`, `b[5]`, or `b[i]` for `i` from 0 to 2.

Given that the loop does not modify any of the specified variables and only iterates based on user input, the state remains unchanged for the variables listed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 5, `i` is equal to `a - 2`, `b[3]` is 0, `b[4]` is equal to \(-6 \times (a-5)\), `b[5]` is equal to \(-6 \times (a-5)\), and all elements `b[i]` for `i` from 0 to 2 are 0.**

Since the loop does not change these values, they remain the same for the next iteration.
