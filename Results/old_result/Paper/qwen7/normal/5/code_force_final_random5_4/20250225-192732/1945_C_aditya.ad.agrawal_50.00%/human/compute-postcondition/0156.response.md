Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is the previous value of `z_r` minus 1, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is 1 greater than its previous value, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The code `z_r -= 1` decrements the value of `z_r` by 1. Since the initial state of `z_r` is decreased by 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, and there is no information that the second element of `arr` is 0, `o_r` remains 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
