Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `x` is equal to the length of `nums`, `start_year` is the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[i] + 1) * nums[i]` for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1.**

Explanation: The code takes a space-separated string of integers as input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `nums`. The value of `num_tests` is reduced by 1, but its exact value is not specified. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `x` is updated to the length of the new `nums` list. The value of `start_year` is recalculated using the updated `nums` list according to the given formula.
