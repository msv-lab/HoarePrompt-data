Output State: **`i` is 4, `size` is 5, `sequence` is modified such that the element at index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result`.**

Given the initial state where `i` is 4 and `size` is 5, the code snippet `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` attempts to modify an element in the `sequence` list. However, the value of `result` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact index or the new value of the element being modified. We only know that the element at index `-result - i - 1` (which simplifies to `-result - 4 - 1` or `-result - 5`) is incremented by `result`.

Since no specific value for `result` is given, we cannot specify the exact index or the new value of the element. Thus, the output state includes the unchanged variables `i` and `size`, along with the modification to the `sequence` list as described.
