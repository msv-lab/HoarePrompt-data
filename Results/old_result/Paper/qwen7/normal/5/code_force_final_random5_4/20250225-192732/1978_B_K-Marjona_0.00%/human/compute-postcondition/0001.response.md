Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer input from the user**.

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The initial state of these variables is set to the integers input by the user.
