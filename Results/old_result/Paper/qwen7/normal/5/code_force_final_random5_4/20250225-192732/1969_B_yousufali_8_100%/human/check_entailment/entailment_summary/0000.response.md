Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The provided solution has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case, calling `func_1` for each one.
4. `func_1` processes a binary string and calculates the cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operations needed to sort the string.
5. The logic in `func_1` assumes that the cost is simply the sum of the positions of '0's followed by '1's, which is incorrect because it does not account for the actual cyclic shifts required to sort the string.
6. Given the problem constraints and the nature of cyclic shifts, a correct solution would involve identifying the longest sorted prefix and then calculating the cost based on the remaining unsorted suffixes, potentially involving multiple cyclic shifts.

Since `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum total cost using cyclic shifts, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
