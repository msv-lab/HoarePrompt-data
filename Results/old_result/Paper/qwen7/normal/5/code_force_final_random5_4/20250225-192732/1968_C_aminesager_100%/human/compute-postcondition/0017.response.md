Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list starting with the integer 1000.
   - Each subsequent element in `a` is calculated as the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element from the list `T` (excluding the first element of `T`).
   - The value of `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` equals `n`.

2. **List Construction:**
   - The first element of `a` is `1000`.
   - For the second element of `a`, it would be `1000 + T[0]`.
   - For the third element of `a`, it would be `(1000 + T[0]) + T[1] = 1000 + T[0] + T[1]`.
   - This pattern continues until the `n`-th element of `a`.

3. **Result String:**
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement outputs the string `result`.

Given this information, let's describe the output:

- The first element of `a` is `1000`.
- The second element of `a` is `1000 + T[0]`.
- The third element of `a` is `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`.
- And so on, up to the `n`-th element of `a`, which is `1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]`.

Therefore, the `result` string will contain the elements of `a` separated by spaces, starting with `1000` and then each subsequent element being the cumulative sum of `1000` and the elements of `T` up to the previous element.

Output: **1000 1000+T[0] 1000+T[0]+T[1] ... 1000+T[0]+T[1]+...+T[n-2]**
