Output State: **`index` is 7 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` adds the value of `result` to the list `results`. Since no specific value for `result` was given, we know that `results` now contains one more element than before, which is `result`. All other variables remain unchanged.
