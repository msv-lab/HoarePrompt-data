Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is 0, `success` is True, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `position` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is `health` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `healths` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The line `position, health = monsters[i]` updates the `position` and `health` variables to be the first and second elements of the tuple at index `i` in the `monsters` list, respectively. Since `i` was previously `i + 3`, it is now adjusted to `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
