Output State: **`i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`, `size` is `i + 2`, and \(3 \times (1 << i) \leq number\)**

Explanation: The code `size += 1` increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` was defined as `i + 1`. After incrementing, `size` becomes `i + 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
