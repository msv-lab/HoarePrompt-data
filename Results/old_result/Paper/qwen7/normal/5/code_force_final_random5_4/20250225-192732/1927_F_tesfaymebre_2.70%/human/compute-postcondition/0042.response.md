Output State: **_min_edge is dsu.min_edge[parent_u], `w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is updated to be the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is updated to be the root of `v` in the DSU structure.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` to `_min_edge`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `_min_edge` is now dependent on the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, while the values of `w`, `u`, `v`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain as they were in the initial state.
