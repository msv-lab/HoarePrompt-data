Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
3. It then checks the conditions for a stair and a peak:
   - If \(a < b < c\), it prints 'STAIR'.
   - If \(a < b > c\), it prints 'PEAK'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NONE'.
4. The logic implemented in the program matches the conditions provided in the problem description accurately.

Given that the program follows the exact logic required to solve the problem and produces the expected output as per the example provided in the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
