Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

Given these points, we need to update the state accordingly:

- `i` will be incremented to 1.
- `n` must remain greater than 1.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
