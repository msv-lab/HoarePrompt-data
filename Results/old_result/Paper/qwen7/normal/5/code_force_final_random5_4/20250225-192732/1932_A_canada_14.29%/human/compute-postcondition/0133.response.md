Output State: **`thorn` is 0, `ret` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a list that must have at least one element, `i` is an element of `s` and `i` is not '@'**

The code `thorn == 0` is a comparison that checks if `thorn` is equal to 0. Since `thorn` is initially 0, this comparison does not change the value of any variable. Therefore, the values of `thorn`, `ret`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
