Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 4`, `m` must be at least 3, `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `nums[0]` followed by `arr[i]`**.

The code `ans = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
