Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is an integer, `l` is a list containing two elements which are `ans` and `i`, the value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains one element `ans`. After executing the code, `l` will contain `ans` and `i`. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that `i` is less than or equal to `k` still holds.
