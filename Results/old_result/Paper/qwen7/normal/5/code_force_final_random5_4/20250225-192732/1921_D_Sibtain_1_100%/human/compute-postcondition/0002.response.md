Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by spaces.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
