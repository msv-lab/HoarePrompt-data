Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: 
   - `nums` is a list with at least one element.
   - `i` is the next element in `nums`.
   - `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `nums`, after the current iteration, `i` will be the next element in `nums`.
   - `nums` will be the remaining elements of the list after removing the current `i`.
   - `curr` will be updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `nums` will now be the list without the first element (which was `i`).
- `i` will be the next element in the updated `nums`.
- `curr` will be updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nums` is a list with at least one element (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element in `nums`, and `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`**.
