Output State: **`i` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B', and the last character of `inpstr` is 'B'. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `ind2`, or `inpstr`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. Since no new assignments or changes are made to the variables, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
