Output State: **`left` is now `left - 1`, `leftZero` is adjusted based on whether `s[left]` is '0' or not, either decreasing by 1 if `s[left]` is '0' or remaining the same if it is not. `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left]` is '0', and `rightOne` is increased by 1 while `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left]` is not '0'.**

This means that the value of `left` has been decremented by 1. The adjustments to `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, and `leftOne` depend on the value of `s[left]`. If `s[left]` is '0', `leftZero` decreases by 1 and `rightZero` increases by 1. If `s[left]` is not '0', `leftOne` decreases by 1 and `rightOne` increases by 1.
