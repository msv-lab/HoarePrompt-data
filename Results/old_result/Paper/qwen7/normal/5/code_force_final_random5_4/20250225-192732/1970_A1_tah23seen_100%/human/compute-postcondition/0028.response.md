Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is `ans` plus `s[i]`.
   - `i` is the first value of the first tuple in `d`.
   - `j` is the second value of the first tuple in `d`.
   - `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for (i, j) in d:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(i, j)` in the list `d`.
   - After the first iteration, `i` and `j` are set to the values of the first tuple in `d`.
   - For the loop to execute again, the next tuple in `d` must be considered.

4. **Next Tuple in `d`:**
   - Since `d` is sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index, the next tuple in `d` will have a different `i` and `j` value.
   - The `i` value will be the first element of the next tuple in `d`.
   - The `j` value will be the second element of the next tuple in `d`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `ans` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop head.
   - `i` and `j` need to be updated to the values of the next tuple in `d`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` is updated to the first value of the next tuple in `d`.
   - `j` is updated to the second value of the next tuple in `d`.
   - `d` remains a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` is `ans` plus `s[i]`, `i` is the first value of the next tuple in `d`, `j` is the second value of the next tuple in `d`, `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index**.
