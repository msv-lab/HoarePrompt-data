Output State: **`a` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the input provided by the user initially, the second element is the current input provided by the user; `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the last element in `a` and the first character of the last element in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` plus the last character of the last element in `a`; `i` is `n`; `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user; `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in `a` to `last_row`. Since `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` now includes this character twice. All other variables remain unchanged.
