Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `ans` is max(`t1`, `t2`) + max(`t1`, `t2`), `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[0])`**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
