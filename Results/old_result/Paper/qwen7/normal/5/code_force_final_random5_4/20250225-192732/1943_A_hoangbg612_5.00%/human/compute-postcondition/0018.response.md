Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is -1 and the value is 1, `num` is less than or equal to -1**.

Explanation: The line `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Since `cur` is -1, the dictionary `M` now has a key `-1` with a value of `1` (initially it was `0` and now it is incremented by `1`). All other variables remain unchanged.
