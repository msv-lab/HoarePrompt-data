Output State: **`s` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `s = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Since the initial state only mentions `s` as being assigned the result of `int(input())`, the output state is that `s` is an input integer.
