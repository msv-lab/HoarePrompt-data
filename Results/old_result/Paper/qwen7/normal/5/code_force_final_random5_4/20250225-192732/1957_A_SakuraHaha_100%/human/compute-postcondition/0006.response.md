Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `x`, which iterates over the list `a`. Other relevant variables are `a` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 100, where `n` is at least 1.
   - `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the list `a`, the next element `x` will be the next integer in the list `a`.
   - After processing `x`, the list `a` will have one less element (since it is being iterated over).
   - The dictionary `cnt` will be updated based on the value of `x`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` will now be a list with one less element.
   - `cnt` will be updated based on the value of `x`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `a` has one less element and `cnt` has been updated.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of `n-1` integers each between 1 and 100, where `n` is at least 1; `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, with the count of the integer `x` updated accordingly**.
