Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by a positive integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user input, checks if their sum is even, and prints either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the result. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results directly.**
