Based on the initial state provided:

- `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the last element of `nums` (`last`).
- `curr` is not equal to 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will simply print the string 'NO' regardless of the value of `curr`.

Output: **NO**
