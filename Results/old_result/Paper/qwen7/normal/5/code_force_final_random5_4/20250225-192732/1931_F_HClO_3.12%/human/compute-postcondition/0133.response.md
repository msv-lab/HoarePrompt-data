Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing three tuples, `m` must be greater than 2**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple `((a3, l3))`. After executing the line `val.append((a3, l3))`, `val` now contains two tuples, which can be expressed as `val` is a list containing three tuples since the initial tuple was already present. The other variables remain unchanged.
