Output State: **`leftMove` is 6, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged), `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged), `rightZero` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged), `rightOne` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged), `left` is `mid - 3`, `right` is `mid - 2`, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is increased by 1; `tleftOne` is increased by 1, `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the `trightOne` variable has been specifically decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
