Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer (its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `s` is a string input by the user (its value is not relevant to the print statement, but it contains the substring '11').
- `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`, and it is either greater than 2 or odd.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will directly print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **NO**
