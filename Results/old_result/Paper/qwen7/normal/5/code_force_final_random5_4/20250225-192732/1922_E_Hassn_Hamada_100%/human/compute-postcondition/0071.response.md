Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a new sequence based on the input `number` and modifies the `sequence` list by appending specific values to it. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters until `number` becomes 0, at which point it returns the tuple (0, 0).**
