Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length \(n\), `letters` is a list containing the characters from `password` that are not digits plus one additional character `ch`, and `digits` is a list containing the characters from `password` that are digits.**

The code `letters.append(ch)` appends the character `ch` to the list `letters`. This means that the list `letters` now contains all the characters from the string `password` that are not digits, plus the character `ch`. The length of `password` remains \(n\), and the list `digits` remains unchanged as it only contains the digits from `password`.
