Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
