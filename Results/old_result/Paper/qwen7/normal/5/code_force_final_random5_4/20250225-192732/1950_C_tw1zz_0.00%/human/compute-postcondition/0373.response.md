Postcondition: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '10' if `h` is '10', '11' if `h` is '11' or '23', '12' if `h` is '00' or '12', '01' if `h` is '13', '02' if `h` is '14', '03' if `h` is '15', '04' if `h` is '16', '05' if `h` is '17', '06' if `h` is '18', '07' if `h` is '19', '08' if `h` is '20', '09' if `h` is '21', '10' if `h` is '22', or '11' if `h` is '23', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '10', '11', or '12', otherwise `time` is 'PM'.**
