Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 1, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 with 100000000 appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Since `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `ans` will now contain one of these values plus the newly appended value, which is also one of these values. Therefore, `ans` will be a list containing two identical values from the set {99999999, 100000000}.
