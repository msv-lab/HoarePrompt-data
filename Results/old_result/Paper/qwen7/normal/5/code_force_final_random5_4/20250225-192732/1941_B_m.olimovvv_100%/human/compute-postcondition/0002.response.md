Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)`, and then creates a list `b` from these converted integers. The variable `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
