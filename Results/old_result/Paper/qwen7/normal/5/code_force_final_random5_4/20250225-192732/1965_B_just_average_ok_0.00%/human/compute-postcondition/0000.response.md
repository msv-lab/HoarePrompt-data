Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop will execute as long as the input value (let's call it `num_tests`) is a positive integer.
   - Since the input is read from the user, we cannot directly control its value, but we need to ensure that it is a valid input for the loop to execute.

3. **Constraints on Input:**
   - The problem states that `t` (which is the input value) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

Given these points, we need to ensure that the input value `num_tests` is within the specified range for the loop to execute.

**State Adjustment:**
- We need to ensure that the input value `num_tests` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value `num_tests`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000**
