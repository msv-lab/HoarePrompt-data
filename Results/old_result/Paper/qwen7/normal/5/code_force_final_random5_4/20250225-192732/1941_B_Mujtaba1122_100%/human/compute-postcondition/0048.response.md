Output State: **`i` is 3, `list[3]` is now `list[3] - 2 * list[2] - 1`, `list[2]` is greater than 0, `list[4]` must be greater than 0, `list[3] - list[2] - 1` is updated, `list[i + 1]` (which is `list[4]`) is decreased by `list[i - 1]` (which is `list[2]`), so `list[4]` is now `list[4] - list[2]`.**

This means that:
- `i` remains 3.
- `list[3]` remains as `list[3] - 2 * list[2] - 1`.
- `list[2]` remains greater than 0.
- `list[4]` was originally greater than 0 and is now decreased by `list[2]`, making it `list[4] - list[2]`.
- `list[3]` is updated to `list[3] - list[2] - 1`.
