### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes, and from the second installation every `b` minutes. Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the visibility of fireworks from the same installation does not overlap, but fireworks from different installations can potentially overlap if their launch times align within the visibility window.

3. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period.
   - Specifically, it uses `m // a + 1` for the first installation and `m // b + 1` for the second installation.
   - The total number of fireworks seen simultaneously is the sum of these two quantities plus 2 (to account for the initial fireworks launched at time 0).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula `ans = m // a + m // b + 2` is derived correctly based on the problem statement.
   - However, the annotated code and the original assessment do not fully capture the nuances of the problem. The key issue is that the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not always give the correct answer because it does not account for the overlapping intervals properly.

5. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Let's consider the example given in the problem description: `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`.
     - The first installation launches fireworks at times: 0, 6, 12, 18.
     - The second installation launches fireworks at times: 0, 7, 14, 21.
     - The visibility of fireworks from the first installation is from 0 to 4, 6 to 10, 12 to 16, 18 to 22.
     - The visibility of fireworks from the second installation is from 0 to 4, 7 to 11, 14 to 18, 21 to 25.
     - The overlapping times are: 0 to 4, 7 to 10, 14 to 16, 18 to 18.
     - Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2 (from the first and second installations at times 0 to 4, 7 to 10, 14 to 16, and 18 to 18).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the overlapping intervals. It overcounts the number of fireworks because it assumes that each interval is disjoint, which is not true.
   - The correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculating the number of fireworks launched within the visibility period, taking into account the overlaps.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not properly account for the overlapping intervals of fireworks from different installations. The correct approach involves a more detailed analysis of the intervals and their overlaps.
