Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where `a < b < c` or they are not all equal and the maximum value among them is either `b` or not equal to `b`.

The `print('NONE')` statement simply prints the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
