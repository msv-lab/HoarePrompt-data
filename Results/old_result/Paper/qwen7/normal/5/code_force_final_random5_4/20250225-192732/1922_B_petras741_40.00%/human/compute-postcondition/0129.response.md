Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from another input split by spaces, `eta_ln` is 3, `j` is `n`, `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 0. If `n` is 3 or more, `j` is `n`, `res` is updated to the original value of `res` plus the specified summations, and `rho` is updated accordingly. If `n` is 1 or 2, `j` becomes `eta_ln`, `res` is updated to the original value of `res` plus the specified summations, and `rho` is updated accordingly. If `j` exceeds 1000, the loops or if statements are exited. If `n` is less than 3, `t` remains the same, `buffer` remains unchanged, `i` remains 1, `n` remains the same, and `w` remains unchanged.**
