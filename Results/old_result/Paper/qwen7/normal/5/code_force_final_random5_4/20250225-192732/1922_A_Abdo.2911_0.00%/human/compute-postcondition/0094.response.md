Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `n` is greater than 0, and `template[i+2]` is not a lowercase character.**

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block that is a loop or a `case` statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block (like `case` or `switch`) immediately surrounding the `break` statement, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply indicates that the execution would exit the nearest enclosing loop or block. However, since no such block exists in the given snippet, the state remains unchanged.
