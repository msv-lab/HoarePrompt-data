Output State: **`mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `right` is `mid` plus the number of iterations the loop executed, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted according to the characters encountered during each iteration of the loop, `rightOne` is 0, if `right` equals `n`, then either `trightZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` (in which case `trightZero` remains unchanged) or `rightOne` is less than half of `n + 1`, otherwise the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2` if `right` is not equal to `n`, and `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `rightOne = 0` sets the value of `rightOne` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
