#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a 2D list of strings, where each string contains M characters and there are N such strings. The list contains characters representing empty cells ('..'), players ('R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9'), goals ('RG', 'BG'), and the Quaffle ('.Q'). Additionally, the function takes a list of strings describing the actions performed during the game, where each string contains information about the entity performing the action and the action itself.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple containing the sum of x and the first element of b (dx), and the sum of y and the second element of b (dy)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples `a` and `b`, each containing two integers. It returns a tuple containing the sum of the first elements of `a` and `b`, and the sum of the second elements of `a` and `b`.
