Output State: **`a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user, `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `last_row`. Since `a` contains only one element (which is the input provided by the user), `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of that single element. Therefore, `last_row` now includes this last character. All other variables remain unchanged.
