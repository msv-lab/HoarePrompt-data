Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **num_tests**: It is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\). This value does not affect the print statement directly but is mentioned for context.

2. **n**: This is the integer obtained from the first input split. Its value is not specified, but it doesn't impact the length of the list `nums`.

3. **k**: This is an integer less than 16. Its specific value is not needed to determine the length of `nums`.

4. **nums**: This is a list containing the following elements:
   \[
   [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k-15, k+17]
   \]
   The list contains 24 fixed numbers followed by two additional numbers: \(k-15\) and \(k+17\).

5. **idx**: This is set to 2, which is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(len(nums))
```

To find the length of the list `nums`, we need to count the number of elements in it. The list starts with 24 fixed numbers and ends with two additional numbers, making the total number of elements:
\[
24 + 2 = 26
\]

Therefore, the length of `nums` is 26.

Output: **26**
