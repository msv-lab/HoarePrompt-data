### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the key points and further validate the assessment:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation:**
   - The program attempts to split a number into its digits and insert them back into the array. This approach is flawed because simply splitting and reinserting digits does not guarantee that the resulting array will be sorted. For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. Splitting `45` into `[4, 5]` and inserting them results in `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is still not sorted.

2. **Function `func_1` Usage:**
   - The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the array is sorted but only does so once after the operations. If the operations do not make the array sorted, the program will incorrectly print 'Yes'. This is a critical flaw because the program should ensure that the array is sorted after performing the operations.

3. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The logic to split and insert digits is flawed and does not ensure that the array will become sorted. The program does not guarantee that the array will be transformed into a sorted array through the described operations.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required logic to transform the array into a sorted one. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect based on the analysis and the issues identified.
