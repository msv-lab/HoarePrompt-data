Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 2, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a` + `f`, `m` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is increased by `f`.**

In this output state, the variable `a` has been updated to be its original value plus `f`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
