Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
2. The provided code has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_1` sorts the array and calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. However, this approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty because it does not consider rearranging the elements.
4. `func_2` reads input data, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. It correctly handles multiple test cases and calculates the beauty for each array.
5. The key issue is that `func_1` does not rearrange the array to maximize the beauty; instead, it calculates the beauty based on the sorted order. This does not guarantee the maximum beauty.
6. To solve the problem correctly, we need to find a way to rearrange the elements to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements. One effective strategy is to place the largest and smallest elements at the ends and alternate them to maximize the differences.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect because `func_1` does not rearrange the array to achieve the maximum beauty. Therefore, the program as given does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
