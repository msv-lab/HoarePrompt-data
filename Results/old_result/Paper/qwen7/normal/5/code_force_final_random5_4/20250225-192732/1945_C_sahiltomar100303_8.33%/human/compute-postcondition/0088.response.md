Postcondition: `left` must be at least 1, and (`leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`). If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1, while the condition remains unchanged. If `s[left - 1]` is not '0', then `leftZero` remains the same, `rightOne` is increased by 1, and the condition remains unchanged.
