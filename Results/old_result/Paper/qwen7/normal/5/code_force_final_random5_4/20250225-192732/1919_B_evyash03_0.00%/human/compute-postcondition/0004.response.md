Output State: **`expression` must have at least one character, and the current value of the character `char` is '+', balance is 1 more than its previous value.**

Explanation: The variable `balance` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `balance` was not specified, we can only say that it is now 1 more than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
