Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. In this case, the initial conditions of `idx1` and `idx2` being equal to `i` and the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` are still valid, but the loop or if statement is exited.
