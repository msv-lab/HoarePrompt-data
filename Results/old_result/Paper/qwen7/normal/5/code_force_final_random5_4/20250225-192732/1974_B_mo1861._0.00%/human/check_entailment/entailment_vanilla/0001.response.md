Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the encoded string itself.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `char_map` is created to map each unique character in `b` to its corresponding decoded character.
   - The characters in `b` are sorted and added to the dictionary with their corresponding decoded characters. The decoded character is determined by calculating the position of the character in the reversed alphabet.
   - Finally, the function constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Creating the Character Map:**
   - The characters in `b` are sorted using `sorted(set(b))`. This ensures that each unique character appears only once and in alphabetical order.
   - For each character in the sorted list, the corresponding decoded character is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of the character in the sorted list.
   - This calculation ensures that the first character in the sorted list maps to the last character in the alphabet, the second character maps to the second-to-last character, and so on.

2. **Constructing the Decoded String:**
   - The decoded string `s` is constructed by iterating over each character in `b` and replacing it with its mapped value from `char_map`.

### Verification

To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Example:**
  - Encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`
  - Sorted unique characters: `r, c, d, e, f, o, s`
  - Character map:
    - `r -> c` (last character in the alphabet)
    - `c -> s` (second-to-last character in the alphabet)
    - `d -> r` (third-to-last character in the alphabet)
    - `e -> e` (fourth-to-last character in the alphabet)
    - `f -> d` (fifth-to-last character in the alphabet)
    - `o -> o` (sixth-to-last character in the alphabet)
    - `s -> c` (first character in the alphabet)
  - Decoded string: `codeforces`

The program correctly constructs the character map and uses it to decode the string. Therefore, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True**
