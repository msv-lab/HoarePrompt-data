Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the range `range(4)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = 3`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`.
   - `p2` is `x - y`.
   - `res` is 0.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < 4`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 4, which it is.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The values of `x`, `y`, `coord`, `p2`, and `res` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing the tuple (`x`, `y`), `p2` is `x - y`, `res` is 0**
