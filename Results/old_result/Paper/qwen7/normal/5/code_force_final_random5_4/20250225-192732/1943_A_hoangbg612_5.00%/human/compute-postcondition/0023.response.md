Output State: **`cur` is either 0 or equal to `next_num` (if `next_num > cur`), `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 before the increment, or the key `cur+1` with value 1 if `cur` was not -1 before the increment, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not modify any of the existing variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since no changes are made to the variables, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
