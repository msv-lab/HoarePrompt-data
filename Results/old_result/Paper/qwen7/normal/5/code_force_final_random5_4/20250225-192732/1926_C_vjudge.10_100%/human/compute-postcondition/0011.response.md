Output State: **`sum_value_digits` contains the sum of all digits in the final value of `i`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `sum_value_digits` will contain the sum of all the digits in the final value of `i`. This is because the loop iterates over each digit in the string representation of `i`, converting it to an integer and adding it to `sum_value_digits`. Therefore, by the end of the loop, `sum_value_digits` will hold the total sum of all digits in `i`.
