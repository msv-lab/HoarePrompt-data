Output State: **`d` is a sorted list containing at least one tuple, the first tuple in `d` has `i` as `n-1`, and `j` is some value corresponding to the first element in `d`, `ans` is increased by `s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[i]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `s[i]`. The precondition states that `d` is a sorted list containing at least one tuple, the first tuple in `d` has `i` as `n-1`, and `j` is some value corresponding to the first element in `d`. These conditions remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans` is now increased by `s[i]`.
