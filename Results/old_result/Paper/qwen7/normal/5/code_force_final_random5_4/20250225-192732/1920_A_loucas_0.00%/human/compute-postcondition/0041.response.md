Output State: **`num` is equal to `i`, `less` contains at least one element, `big` contains at least one element, and `max(big)` is greater than or equal to `min(less)`.**

The variable `num` is assigned the value of `i`, while the sets `less` and `big` remain unchanged. The condition that `max(big)` is greater than or equal to `min(less)` also remains valid.
