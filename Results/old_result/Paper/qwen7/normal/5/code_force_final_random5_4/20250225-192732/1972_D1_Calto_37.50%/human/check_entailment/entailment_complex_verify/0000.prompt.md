You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: Output State: The values of `a` and `b` will be such that `b` is 0 and `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. After the loop completes all its iterations, `a` will hold the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` will be 0 since the remainder becomes 0 when the GCD is found.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, with `b` being 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. Upon completion, it returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, with `b` being set to 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 1, `i` is 4, `m` must be greater than 3, `x` is -20, `y` is 16.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues until `i` reaches `m`. From the given information, we can see that after the third iteration, `i` is 3 and `m` must be greater than 3. Since `i` increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 4. However, the value of `cnt` does not change from the third iteration because the condition `i > 1` is still true but the term `x // y` results in a negative or zero value, which does not contribute to increasing `cnt`. Therefore, `cnt` remains at 1. The values of `x` and `y` continue to decrease as per the formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, respectively. For `i = 4`, `x` becomes `-20` and `y` becomes `16`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is 1, `i` is 4, `m` must be greater than 3, `x` is -20, `y` is 16, `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6). It iterates through a loop from 1 to `m-1`, calculating values for `x` and `y` based on the current index `i`. It updates a counter `cnt` based on these values. If `cnt` remains 0 after the loop, the function returns 1; otherwise, it also returns 1. The function always returns 1 regardless of the input values.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the core requirement of counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is not used in the problem.
- `func_2` appears to be an attempt to solve the problem but does not correctly implement the logic required. It seems to be attempting to count pairs based on a specific formula involving squares, which is not relevant to the problem statement.

To verify this, consider the following test case:
- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)

Expected output: 3 (as mentioned in the example output).

However, running the provided code with this input will not produce the correct result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
