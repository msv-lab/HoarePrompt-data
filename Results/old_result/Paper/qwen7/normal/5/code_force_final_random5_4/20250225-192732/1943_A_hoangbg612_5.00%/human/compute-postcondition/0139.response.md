Output State: **`cur` is -1, `i` is 0, `T` is 3, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`, and the value of `num` is less than or equal to -1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Given that `cur` is `-1`, the dictionary `M` now has the key `-1` with a value of `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
