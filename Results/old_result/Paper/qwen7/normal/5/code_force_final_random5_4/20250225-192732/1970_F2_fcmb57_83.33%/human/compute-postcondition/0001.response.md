Output State: **a is assigned to x and a is assigned to y; b is split into dx and dy.**

Explanation: The initial state has `a` assigned to both `x` and `y`, and `b` remains unchanged. The line `dx, dy = b` implies that `b` is a tuple (or iterable) and is being unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. Since the exact values of `b` are not specified, we keep it as `b` is split into `dx` and `dy`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
