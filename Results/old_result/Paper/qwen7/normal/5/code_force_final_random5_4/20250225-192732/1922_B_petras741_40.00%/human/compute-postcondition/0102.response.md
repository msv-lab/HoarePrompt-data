Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, eta_ln):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to `n`.
   - `eta_ln` is given as 3.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for j in range(1, eta_ln)` will execute if `eta_ln` is greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `eta_ln`). Given that `eta_ln` is 3, the loop will definitely execute because 3 > 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` is initialized to `n`, so `n` must be set to a value such that `j` falls within the range (1, 3). Since `j` starts at `n` and the loop will increment `j` until it reaches 3, `n` must be 1 or 2 (because if `n` were 0, `j` would start at 0 and the loop would not execute).
   - `eta_ln` is already given as 3, so no adjustment is needed here.

5. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - `q[j]` is 0, but since `j` is initialized to `n` and `n` must be 1 or 2, `q[1]` or `q[2]` will be 0 during the loop.
   - `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2, but this doesn't affect the loop's execution directly.
   - `rho` is 0, but this also doesn't affect the loop's execution directly.
   - `eta_ln` is not equal to 1, which is true since `eta_ln` is 3.
   - `res` is 0, but this doesn't affect the loop's execution directly.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` and `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be 1 or 2, `j` is `n`**
