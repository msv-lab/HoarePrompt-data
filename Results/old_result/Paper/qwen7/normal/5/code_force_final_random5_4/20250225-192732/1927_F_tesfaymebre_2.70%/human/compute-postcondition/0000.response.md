Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4 after calling `func_1()`.**

Explanation: The code `test_cases = func_1()` assigns the return value of the function `func_1()` to the variable `test_cases`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `test_cases`, but we know it will be an integer within the specified range. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is not affected by this line of code.
