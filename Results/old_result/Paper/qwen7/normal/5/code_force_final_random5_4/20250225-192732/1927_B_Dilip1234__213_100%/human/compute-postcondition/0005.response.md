Output State: **`char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`; `s` is a string containing the character corresponding to the index `j` in the alphabet.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends to the string `s` the character corresponding to the index `j` in the alphabet. Here, `ord('a')` returns the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97. Adding `j` to this value gives the ASCII value of the character at position `j` in the alphabet (e.g., if `j` is 0, the character is 'a'; if `j` is 1, the character is 'b', etc.). The values of `char_count` and `a` remain unchanged.
