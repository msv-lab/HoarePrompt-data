Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `total_count` is the sum of all values in the original `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in the original `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes `num_of_lens` as an empty dictionary. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables, so they remain unchanged from their initial states.
