The loop condition is `j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied.

1. The first condition is `j > 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has been decreased by 1. To ensure this condition holds true, `j` must be greater than 0 before the decrement. This means `j_new` (the value of `j` at the start of the current iteration) must be at least 1.
2. The second condition is `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`. This condition must hold true after the decrement as well. Therefore, `arr[j_new]` must be equal to `arr[j_new - 1]`.

Given these requirements, we need to adjust the state to ensure both conditions are met for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`j` is decreased by 1, and to ensure the loop continues, `j_new` must be greater than 1 and `arr[j_new]` must be equal to `arr[j_new - 1]`**.
