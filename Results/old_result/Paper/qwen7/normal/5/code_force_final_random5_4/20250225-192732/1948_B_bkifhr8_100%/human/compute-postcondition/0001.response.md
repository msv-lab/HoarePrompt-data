Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for an index) and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Since the loop runs `n` times, `n` itself must be a valid input within the given range (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the given conditions. Specifically, `n` must be within the specified range.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

Since the loop depends on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `n` must be an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50**.
