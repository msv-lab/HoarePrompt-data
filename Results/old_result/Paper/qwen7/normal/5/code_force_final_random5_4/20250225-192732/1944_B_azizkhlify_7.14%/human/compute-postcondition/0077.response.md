Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `re` is `re + 2`
- `res` contains `a[n-1]` and `a[n-1]`, meaning `res` is a list with two elements both being `a[n-1]`
- `l[a[n-1] - 1]` equals 1

The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[i]`.

Since `i` is `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[n-1]`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `a[n-1]`.

Output: **a[n-1]**
