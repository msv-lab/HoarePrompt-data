Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `results` is a list of strings that contain either 'yes' or 'no'.
   - `t` is the length of the `results` list.
   - `i` is set to `t-1`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is defined as `t-1`, where `t` is the length of the `results` list, `i` will be the index of the last element in the `results` list.

4. **Output**:
   - The print statement will output the value of `i`, which is the index of the last element in the `results` list.

Output: **t-1 (where t is the length of the results list)**
