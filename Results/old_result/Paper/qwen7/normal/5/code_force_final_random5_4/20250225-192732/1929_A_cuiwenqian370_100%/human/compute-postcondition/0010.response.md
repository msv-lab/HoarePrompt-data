Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `index` is increased by 1 + `n`; `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**.

This means that after executing the line `result = func_1(array)`, the variable `result` now holds the return value of the function `func_1` when called with `array` as its argument. All other variables retain their previous values according to the initial state.
