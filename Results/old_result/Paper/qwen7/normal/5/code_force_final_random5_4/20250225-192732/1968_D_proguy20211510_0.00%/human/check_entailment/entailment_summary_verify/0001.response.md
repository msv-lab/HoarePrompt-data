### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It also correctly reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function checks if both players start with the maximum value in the array `a`. If both players start with the maximum value, it prints 'Draw'. This is correct because in this case, both players will have the same score if they follow the optimal strategy.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where both players start with the maximum value correctly. It should check if both `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are equal to the maximum value in `a`. The current implementation only checks if `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are individually equal to the maximum value, which is incorrect.

3. **Single Maximum Value Check**:
   - The function checks if either player starts with the maximum value in the array `a`. If one player starts with the maximum value, it prints 'Bodya' or 'Sasha' accordingly. This is correct because the player starting with the maximum value will always have a higher score if they stay at their initial position for all turns.

4. **Dynamic Score Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the scores for both players using a dynamic approach. It iterates through the turns and updates the scores based on the current position and the maximum value in the array `a`. This part is more complex and involves calculating potential scores considering the possibility of moving to the next position in the permutation.
   - The function uses a list `b` to store the scores for Bodya and a list `s` to store the scores for Sasha. It then calculates the cumulative sums of these scores and determines the maximum possible scores for both players.
   - The function correctly calculates the scores for both players, considering the permutations and the maximum value in `a`.

5. **Final Score Comparison**:
   - After calculating the potential scores, the function compares the final scores of both players and prints the result accordingly. This part is correct because it considers all possible moves and calculates the maximum possible score for each player.

### Conclusion:

The function has a logical error in the initial checks where it incorrectly determines if both players start with the maximum value in the array `a`. The current implementation only checks if `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are individually equal to the maximum value, which is incorrect. It should check if both `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are equal to the maximum value in `a`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
