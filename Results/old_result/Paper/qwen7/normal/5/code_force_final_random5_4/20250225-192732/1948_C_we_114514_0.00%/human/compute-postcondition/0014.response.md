Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, and `row1[j]` is not equal to '>'**.

Explanation: The variable `reachable_first_row` is explicitly set to `False` by the code. All other variables retain their initial conditions as specified in the initial state.
