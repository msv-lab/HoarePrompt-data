Postcondition: `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 4, and `count_u` is the number of 'U' in string `s`. If the number of 'U' in string `s` is odd, the function does not change `count_u`. Otherwise, `count_u` is even.
