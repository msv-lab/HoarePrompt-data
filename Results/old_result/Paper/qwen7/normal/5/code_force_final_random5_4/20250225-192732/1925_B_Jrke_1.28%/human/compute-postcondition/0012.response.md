Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, `l` is a list containing two elements ['ans', `i`], and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains one element 'ans'. After appending `i`, `l` will contain two elements: 'ans' and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
