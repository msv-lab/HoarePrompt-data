Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was one less than its value in the current iteration.
   - Therefore, to start the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`j < n`) must still hold true.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `j`**
