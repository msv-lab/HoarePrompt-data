Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ind1 is the index of the first 'B' in the string inpstr, ind2 is 0, inpstr is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B', outind is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(inpstr)):
    if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
        ind2 = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B', and either the last character of `inpstr` is 'B', in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no such condition since the else part does not change the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B'. If the last character of `inpstr` (i.e., `inpstr[-1]`) is 'B', then `i` remains 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the last character of `inpstr` is not 'B', then the conditions remain as they were before the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B'. If the character at position `inpstr[-i - 1]` (which is `inpstr[-3]` since `i` is 2) is 'B', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character is not 'B', the condition does not change the value of `i` or `inpstr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
