Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `a[i]` is the sum of `a[0]` and all elements in the list `x` up to index `n-2`

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(*a)` is executed.

1. Since `i` is equal to `n-1`, this means that `i` is the last index of the list `a`.
2. The value of `a[i]` is given as the sum of `a[0]` and all elements in the list `x` up to index `n-2`. This implies that `a[i]` contains the cumulative sum starting from `a[0]` to `x[n-2]`.
3. Given that `a[0]` is 500 and `x` is a list of numbers, `a[i]` would be `500 + sum(x[0:n-2])`.

Since the exact elements of `x` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `a[i]` in terms of the given information.

Output: **500 + sum(x[0:n-2])**
