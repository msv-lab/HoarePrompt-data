Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to process the input data, but it is called without any arguments in the main loop. This means that when the function is called in the loop, it will attempt to read input from stdin, which is not properly handled since the input is already processed outside the function.

2. **Logic for Polygon Calculation**: The logic inside `func_1` calculates the number of polygons by dividing the count of each stick length by 3. However, this approach is incorrect because it assumes that every set of three sticks of the same length can form a triangle, and then further assumes that multiple triangles can be combined into polygons. This is not necessarily true, as the problem requires forming regular polygons, where all sides must be equal and form closed shapes.

3. **Test Case Handling**: The program should handle multiple test cases as specified, but the current implementation only processes one test case at a time and does not reset variables between test cases.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
