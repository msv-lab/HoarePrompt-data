Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the elements of `N`, so the objects involved are `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` is the current element being processed in each iteration of the loop.
   - `N` is the list that contains the elements being iterated over.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `N` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` is the current element being processed, it doesn't need to be explicitly adjusted because it will take on the values from `N` during each iteration.
   - `N` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `cur` is -1
- `T` is 0 or a negative value
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is now sorted in ascending order
- `M` is an empty dictionary that maps each relevant element to its frequency in `N`

The only object that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `N`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `N` has at least one element.

**State after adjustment**:
State: **`N` must have at least one element**
