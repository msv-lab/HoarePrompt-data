You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n and x, where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a permutation p of length n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing two integers, which are the values of variables 'x' and 't' separated by a space, converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers from user input, separated by a space, converts them to integers, and returns a map object containing these two integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of two integers n and x where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, followed by a permutation p of size n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_1(), which is not defined in the given information.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by calling `func_1()`, which is not defined in the given information. The returned list is the final state of the program after the function concludes.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array arr, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: pos is 3, n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, arr is the result of the function func_2() call, and i is n.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: Output State: `low` is either 0 or one of the previously calculated `mid` values, `high` is either `n` or one of the previously calculated `mid` values, `mid` is the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing all the unique `mid` values calculated during the loop iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `low` will be the smallest index where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k`, or it will be 0 if no such index exists. Similarly, `high` will be the largest index where `arr[high]` is less than `k`, or it will be `n` if no such index exists. The variable `mid` will hold the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `st` will contain all the unique midpoint values calculated during the loop iterations. The values of `pos`, `k`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, 4
    #State: `low` is the smallest index where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k`, or it is 0 if no such index exists, `high` is the largest index where `arr[high]` is less than `k`, or it is `n` if no such index exists, `mid` is the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration of the loop, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, `i` is n, `st` is a set containing all the unique `mid` values calculated during the loop iterations, and `arr[low]` is equal to `k` if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a permutation array `arr` of length `n` and an integer `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n). It first finds the position of `k` in the array. Then, it uses binary search to determine the smallest index `low` where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k`, or 0 if no such index exists. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints `1`, `low + 1`, and `pos + 1`, where `pos` is the initial position of `k` found earlier. The function does not return any value but modifies the output through print statements.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the target value `k` is not present in the permutation `arr`. According to the problem description, the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation such that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. However, the program only checks if `arr[low] == k` and prints `0` or `1` accordingly without attempting to rearrange the elements if `k` is not found.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  The target value `3` is not present in the permutation, so the program should output `2` operations and the pairs of indices to swap. For example:
  ```
  2
  1 4
  4 5
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program outputs `1` and `1 4`, which is incorrect because it does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Since the program does not handle the case where the target value is not present in the permutation, it is not correct according to the problem description.
