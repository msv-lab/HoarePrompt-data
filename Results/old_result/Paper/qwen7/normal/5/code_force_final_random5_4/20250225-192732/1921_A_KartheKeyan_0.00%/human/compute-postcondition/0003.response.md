Output State: **`coord` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, s is the sum calculated from the loop, there are three lines of input left, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\)**.

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `coord`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, or the remaining input lines. Therefore, these conditions remain the same as the initial state.
