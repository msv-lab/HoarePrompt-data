Output State: **`i` is equal to `len_unique`; `len_unique` must be greater than 0; for every key `k` in `char_map`, `char_map[k]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `decoded` is a string where each character is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` as per the mapping defined in `char_map`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)` creates a new string `decoded` by replacing each character in `encoded` with the corresponding character from `unique_chars` as defined in the dictionary `char_map`. Since no changes are made to `i`, `len_unique`, or `char_map`, their values remain the same. The only new variable introduced is `decoded`, which is a string constructed according to the specified mapping.
