Output State: **`input_string` is the input received from the user, `t` is 1, `pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos` at the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is assigned to `b_d`**.

In this case, the variable `b_d` is reassigned to the value of `dist`. All other variables retain their previous values.
