Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1` is an input integer; `y1` is an input integer; `x2` is the first integer from the input split by space; `y2` is the second integer from the input split by space; `x3` is an integer from the input split by space; the current value of `y1` is less than the current value of `y3`; `y3` is an integer from the input split by space; `x4` is an integer from the input split by space; `y4` is an integer from the input split by space; the current value of `x1` is equal to the current value of `x3` and the current value of `x2` is equal to the current value of `x4`; `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`.**

This means that the variable `res` has been assigned the value of the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or relationships as specified in the initial state.
