Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 5, `i` is equal to `a - 2`, `b[3]` is 0, `b[4]` is equal to `-6 * (a-5)`, `b[5]` is equal to `-6 * (a-5)`, and all elements `b[i]` for `i` from 0 to 2 are 0.

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. Given that the loop runs from `0` to `a-3` (since `a-2` is the upper limit), it will iterate `a-2` times. After these iterations, all elements `b[i]` for `i` from 0 to 2 are set to 0, and the value of `b[3]` onwards depends on the value of `a`. Specifically, `b[4]` and `b[5]` are both `-6 * (a-5)` because each iteration subtracts the previous element's value twice from the next one and once from the one after that, starting from `b[0]` down to `b[2]`.
