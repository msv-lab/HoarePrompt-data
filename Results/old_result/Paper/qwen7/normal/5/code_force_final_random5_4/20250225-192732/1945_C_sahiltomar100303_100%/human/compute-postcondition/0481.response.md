Postcondition: `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `n + 1` + 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is 0, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `0`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `0`, `left` is now `0`, `mid` is `0`, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 for each '0' encountered from `mid` to `0`, `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1` if `s[0]` is '0', and `trightOne` is `trightOne - 1` if `s[0]` is '1', and `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - right + 1`. Additionally, the condition `right` equals `n` is true, and either `left` is not equal to 0 or `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - right + 1`.
