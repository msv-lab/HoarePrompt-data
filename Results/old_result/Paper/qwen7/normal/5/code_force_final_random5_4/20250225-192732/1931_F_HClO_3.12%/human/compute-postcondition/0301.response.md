Output State: **`a1` is the first element of the input split into integers, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, and `a2` is the first element of the input split into integers, and `l2` is the rest of the elements split into a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains all elements from `l1` except for the element `a2`. The values of `a1`, `l2`, and `a2` remain unchanged.
