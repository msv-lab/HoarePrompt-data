Output State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `start_year` is the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x-1] + 1) * nums[x-1]` for each `x` from 0 to the length of `nums` minus one, iteratively.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_tests` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and `x` will be equal to the length of `nums`. The variable `start_year` will be the final value obtained by successively applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x-1] + 1) * nums[x-1]` to each element in the `nums` list, starting from an initial `start_year` of 0 and iterating over all elements in the list.
