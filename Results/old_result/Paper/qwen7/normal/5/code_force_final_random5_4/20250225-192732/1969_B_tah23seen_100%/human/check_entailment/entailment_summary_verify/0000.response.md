### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

#### Provided Program:
The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1(s)` and printing the result. The function `func_1(s)` calculates the cost based on the following logic:
- For each '0' in the string, if there are preceding '1's, it adds `one + 1` to the cost.
- For each '1', it adds 2 to the cost.

#### Function Summary:
The provided function summary is incorrect. It states that for each '0' in `s` where the count of preceding '1's (`one`) is greater than 0, it adds `one + 1` to the cost. Additionally, for each '1' in `s`, it adds 2 to the cost. This is not accurate because the summary does not reflect the actual logic implemented in the function.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the longest prefix of '1's and then calculate the cost based on the positions of '0's relative to this prefix. The cost for each '0' should be the distance from the end of the string to the position of the '0'.

Here is the corrected function:
```python
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    max_one_length = 0
    one_count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            one_count += 1
            max_one_length = max(max_one_length, one_count)
        else:
            one_count = 0
    # Calculate the cost based on the longest prefix of '1's
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '0':
            cost += len(s) - i
    return cost - max_one_length
```

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment stated that the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. This is true because the current implementation does not follow the correct logic.
- The provided function summary is also incorrect, as it does not match the actual logic implemented in the function.

Given the corrected function and the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program and function summary do not correctly implement the solution.

### Final:
Final: **False**
