You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `i` is n+1, `ones[n]` is the sum of 1's in `nums` up to index n-1, `sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` minus the count of 1's in `nums`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n+1`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of 1's encountered so far in the `nums` list, with the last element being the total count of 1's in the entire list. The `sum` list will store the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums`, adjusted by subtracting the count of 1's, with the last element being the final adjusted sum.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `n+1`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of 1's encountered so far in the `nums` list, with the last element being the total count of 1's in the entire list. The `sum` list will store the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums`, adjusted by subtracting the count of 1's, with the last element being the final adjusted sum. Each iteration of the loop processes a query defined by `l` and `r`, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition involving `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` pairs of positive integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It returns the results of processing these queries based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
