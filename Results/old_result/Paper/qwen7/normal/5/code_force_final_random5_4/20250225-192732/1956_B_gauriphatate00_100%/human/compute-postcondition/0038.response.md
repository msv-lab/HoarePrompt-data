Output State: **`max_score` is 3, `a` is an empty list, `count_a` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique integer from the original list `a`, ranging from 1 to 2, reflecting how many times each integer appeared in the list, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `num` is 2.**

Explanation: The `max_score` variable was incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`a`, `count_a`, `n`, and `num`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
