Output State: **`curr` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of `nums`**.

Explanation: The line `curr = 0` sets the variable `curr` to 0, regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
