The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `size`, `value`, `number`, and `size_overlap`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are modified, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 5`; `value` is \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\); `number` must be at least \(31 \cdot (1 << i)\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 5` and `i`.**
