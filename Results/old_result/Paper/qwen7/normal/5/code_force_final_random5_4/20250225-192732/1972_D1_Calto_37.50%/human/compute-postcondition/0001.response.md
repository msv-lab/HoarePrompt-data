Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and goes up to `m-1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `m`.

3. **Adjust the given states**:
   - `cnt` is 0, which is not directly related to the loop execution.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), which is not directly related to the loop execution.
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\) and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\).

4. **Ensure the loop condition is met**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` (which starts at 1) must be less than `m`. Therefore, `m` must be greater than 1.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `i` should start at 1.
   - `m` must be greater than 1.

Given these points, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1**.
