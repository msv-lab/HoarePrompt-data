Output State: **`b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `b[i]` is `b[i] - b[i]` which is `0`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, resulting in `b[i]` becoming `0`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
