Postcondition: **After all iterations, `cur` will be equal to the last element of `N`, and `M` will be a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears consecutively in the list `N`. If two consecutive numbers in `N` are the same, their counts are added together in the dictionary `M`. The sum of all values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`.**
