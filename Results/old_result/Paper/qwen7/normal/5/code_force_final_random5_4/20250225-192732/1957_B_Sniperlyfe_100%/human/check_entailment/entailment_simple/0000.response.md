Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence of integers.
3. The function `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
4. It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, which is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits.
5. It then iteratively reduces `k` by setting subsequent elements in `nums` to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the current value of `k`.
6. Finally, it adds any remaining value of `k` to `nums[0]` and returns the list `nums`.

This approach ensures that:
- The sum of the elements in `nums` equals `k`.
- The bitwise OR of the elements in `nums` has the maximum number of 1s possible given the constraints.

The logic in `func_1` ensures that the first element `nums[0]` is large enough to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Subsequent elements are set to the smallest possible values to ensure the sum constraint is met while maintaining the maximum number of 1s in the OR operation.

Given the problem constraints and the provided logic, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
