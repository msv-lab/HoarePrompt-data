Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.
3. The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which seems to be a typo in the annotated program (it should be `d = b / 2`).
4. The program checks if buying each yogurt individually (`a * b`) is cheaper than buying pairs of yogurts under the promotion (`a * d`), where `d` is the price for two yogurts divided by two.
5. If the individual price is cheaper, it prints `a * b`; otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`. This logic is correct for minimizing the cost.

However, the logic for calculating the minimum cost can be improved. The current approach does not account for the optimal way to use the promotion. Specifically, the program should consider buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible to minimize the total cost.

Here's the corrected version of the logic:

- Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought.
- Calculate the remaining single yogurts after buying the pairs.
- Compute the total cost based on the pairs and the remaining single yogurts.

Given this, the original implementation is incorrect because it does not properly handle the optimal distribution of the promotion.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you could implement the following logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Number of pairs we can buy
        pairs = n // 2
        # Remaining single yogurts
        singles = n % 2
        
        # Cost calculation
        total_cost = pairs * b + singles * a
        
        print(total_cost)
```

This revised version ensures that the program calculates the minimum cost correctly by maximizing the use of the promotion.
