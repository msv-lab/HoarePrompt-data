Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the first character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is '1', then `one` is set to 2. If the first character of `s` is '0' and there exists at least one '1' in the string `s`, then `cost` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the value of `cost` remains unchanged.
