Output State: **`rightZero` is increased by 1, `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` - 1 or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged because the code only affects `rightZero`. Therefore, the updated state includes that `rightZero` has been increased by 1, while the original conditions about `leftZero` and `rightOne` still hold true.
