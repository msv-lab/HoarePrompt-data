Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1, `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\), and `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `size` and `value`. Initially, `size` was `i + 9` and `value` was \((1 << (i + 7)) - (1 << i)\). After executing the code, `size` is updated to `i + 1` and `value` is updated to \((1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)\). The other variables (`i`, `number`, and `size_overlap`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
