Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `x` is `n - 3`, `y` is 4**

Explanation: The code `y = i * i` assigns the value of `i` squared to `y`. Given that `i` is 2, `y` becomes `2 * 2`, which is 4. The values of `cnt`, `m`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
