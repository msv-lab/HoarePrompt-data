Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and its length is not specified in the initial state but is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, the length of `s` (which is stored in `n`) is the new piece of information. All other conditions about `s` remain unchanged.
