Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and the previous value of `mini`, `start` is incremented by `inc`, `end` remains unchanged, `s` is either 1 more than its previous value (if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`) or increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` (if `mini` does not equal `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`), `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`, `s2`, `inc`, `d2[start]`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` retain their original values, and the current value of `start` is still less than the length of `lst` minus one.**

This means that the value of `d1[start]` is now set to the current value of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
