Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1` is an input integer; `y1` is an input integer; `x2` is the first integer from the input split by space; `y2` is the second integer from the input split by space; `x3` is an integer from the input split by space; `y3` is an integer from the input split by space; `x4` is an integer from the input split by space; `y4` is an integer from the input split by space; `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`; if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1 < y2`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, if `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x2` is equal to `x3`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.
