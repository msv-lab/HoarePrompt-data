### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - `func_1` should determine if the array is already non-decreasing.
   - `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function checks if the array is already non-decreasing using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
     - If true, it returns 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it uses `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))` to check if there is at least one pair where the current element is greater than the next element.
       - If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'.
       - If no such pair exists, it implicitly returns 'Yes'.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - It reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic seems correct for reading and processing multiple test cases.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The core logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly identifies if an array is non-decreasing or if there is exactly one pair where the current element is greater than the next element.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not actually handle the case where the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. It only checks if the array is already non-decreasing or if there is exactly one pair where the current element is greater than the next element.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. This array is not non-decreasing, but it can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. Specifically, if we split it into `[3, 1]` and `[4, 1, 5]` and swap them, we get `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]`, which is not non-decreasing. However, if we split it into `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]` and `[ ]` and swap them, we get `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, which is non-decreasing. The current implementation of `func_1` would incorrectly return 'No' for this case.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem as described. It only checks if the array is already non-decreasing or if there is exactly one pair where the current element is greater than the next element, but it does not check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
