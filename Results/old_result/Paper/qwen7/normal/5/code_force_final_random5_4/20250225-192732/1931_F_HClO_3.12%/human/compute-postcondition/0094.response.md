Output State: `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1.

Explanation: Based on the provided conditions and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

- After the first iteration, either `idx1` and `idx2` are set to 0 and `p2` is set to 1, or `idx1` is set to -1 and `idx2` is set to the current index `i` with `p2` being 1.
- For the second and third iterations, since the loop continues to execute, it implies that the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` was not met, and no further changes were made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`.
- The break condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` ensures that the loop will eventually break, and based on the given output states, the most likely scenario is that `idx1` and `idx2` are set to 0 and `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 after the loop completes its iterations.
