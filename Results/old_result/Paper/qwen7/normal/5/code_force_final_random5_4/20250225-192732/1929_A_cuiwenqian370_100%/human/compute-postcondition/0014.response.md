Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `2 + n`; `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was increased by `1 + n`. After this increment, `index` is now increased by `2 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
