### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description and Expected Behavior**:
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The function should return the minimum possible penalty.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `expression` and an integer `length` (though `length` is not used in the function).
   - It iterates through the string and counts the number of times the balance (difference between the number of `+` and `-`) becomes negative.
   - If the final balance is positive, it adds one to the count; otherwise, it just returns the count.

3. **Behavior of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` essentially counts the number of segments where the balance of `+` and `-` changes.
   - This count is then used to determine the number of subarrays needed to achieve the minimum penalty.

4. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - For each subarray, the penalty is calculated as \( | \text{sum of subarray} | \times \text{length of subarray} \).
   - The function `func_1` does not directly calculate the penalty but rather the number of subarrays needed to achieve the minimum penalty.

5. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly identifies the number of subarrays needed to minimize the penalty.
   - By counting the number of segments where the balance changes, it ensures that each segment has a net zero sum, thereby minimizing the penalty.
   - The final penalty is calculated as the number of subarrays, which is equivalent to the number of segments where the balance changes plus one (if the final balance is positive).

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to minimize the penalty by identifying the optimal number of subarrays. The function `func_1` accurately counts the number of segments where the balance changes, ensuring the minimum penalty is achieved.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by identifying the optimal number of subarrays where the balance changes.
