To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Here, the only object in the loop head is `result`. However, the behavior of the loop and the state changes are influenced by other variables and objects outside the loop head but are relevant to the loop's execution and post-loop state.

Let's break down the requirements step-by-step:

1. **Initial Value of `t`:**
   - `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0.
   - Therefore, `t` must be initialized to a non-negative integer value such that it can decrement to 0 over multiple iterations.

2. **Initial Value of `results`:**
   - `results` is a list that will store the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration.
   - Since the loop will execute `t` times, `results` should be initialized as an empty list or a list with enough space to hold `t` elements.

3. **Initial Value of `array`:**
   - `array` is updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the slice of `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`.
   - Therefore, `array` should be initialized to some initial value before the loop starts.

4. **Initial Value of `n`:**
   - `n` is updated at the start of each iteration to the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `n` should be initialized to some value that allows the loop to start and continue executing.

5. **Initial Value of `index`:**
   - `index` is incremented after each iteration.
   - `index` should be initialized to a value that allows the loop to start and continue iterating through the `data` list.

6. **Initial Value of `data`:**
   - `data` is used to determine the value of `n` and the slice of `data` to update `array`.
   - `data` should be initialized to a list with sufficient elements to allow the loop to execute `t` times.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `t` must be initialized to a non-negative integer.
- `results` must be initialized as an empty list.
- `array` must be initialized to some initial value.
- `n` must be initialized to a value that allows the loop to start.
- `index` must be initialized to a value that allows the loop to start.
- `data` must be initialized to a list with sufficient elements.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: `t` is a non-negative integer, `results` is an empty list, `array` is initialized to some initial value, `n` is initialized to a value that allows the loop to start, `index` is initialized to a value that allows the loop to start, `data` is a list with sufficient elements.**
