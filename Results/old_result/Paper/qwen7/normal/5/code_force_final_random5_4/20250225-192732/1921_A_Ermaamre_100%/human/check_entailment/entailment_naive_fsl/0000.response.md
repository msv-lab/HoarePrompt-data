Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the maximum difference in the x-coordinates will give one side length, and the same applies to the y-coordinates. However, because the problem guarantees that the given points form a square with positive area, the maximum differences in both x and y directions will always be equal, ensuring the calculation of the area is correct. Therefore, the program works as expected for all potential cases described in the problem.
