### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Triangle Inequality Theorem**: For three lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the following conditions must hold:
   - \(a + b > c\)
   - \(a + c > b\)
   - \(b + c > a\)

2. **Given Program Logic**:
   - The program counts the occurrences of each stick length using `num_of_lens`.
   - It then calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with the same length using combinations:
     - If there are `cnt` sticks of the same length, the number of ways to choose 3 sticks is given by \(\binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6}\).
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length:
     - If there are `cnt` sticks of one length and `cnt2` sticks of another length, the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the first length and 1 stick of the second length is given by \(\binom{cnt}{2} \times cnt2 = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times cnt2\).

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the logic of counting occurrences and calculating combinations.
   - However, it does not explicitly check the triangle inequality theorem, which is crucial for determining if the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

4. **Example Input**:
   - Given input:
     ```
     3
     3
     0 1 1
     ```
   - The program would output `3` because it counts the combinations of sticks based on their occurrences, but the valid combinations are only `(2^0, 2^1, 2^1)` which forms a degenerate triangle (area = 0), not a non-degenerate triangle. There are no valid non-degenerate triangles that can be formed from these sticks.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not check the triangle inequality theorem, which is necessary to ensure that the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not account for the triangle inequality condition.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not check the triangle inequality theorem, which is essential for determining if the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.
