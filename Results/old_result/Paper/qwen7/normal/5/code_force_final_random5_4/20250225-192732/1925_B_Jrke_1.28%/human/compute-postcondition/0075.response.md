Postcondition: `x` is an input integer, `i` is 3 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i`, and `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `i`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // i` is appended to the list `l`, and `i` must be less than `int(x)`.
