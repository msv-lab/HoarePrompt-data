Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4
   - `r[a[3] - 1]` is incremented by 1

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).
   - Therefore, `i` will be 4 in the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4.
   - The value of `r[a[3] - 1]` is not directly affected by the loop, so it remains unchanged.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4
   - `r[a[3] - 1]` is incremented by 1 (unchanged from the previous state)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `r[a[3] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
