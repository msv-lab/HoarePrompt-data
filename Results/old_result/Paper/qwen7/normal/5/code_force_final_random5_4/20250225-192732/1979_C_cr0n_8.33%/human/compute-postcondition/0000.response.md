Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, and the list `k` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The initial values of `t` and the list `k` remain unchanged. The variable `N` is assigned the value of the integer input, which is constrained to be between 1 and 50.
