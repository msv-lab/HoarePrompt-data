Postcondition: `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `res`, `test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, and `x` remain as follows: if `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, `total_count` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, and `x` is the second element of `num_list`. If `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1, `total_count` remains the sum of all values in the original `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in the original `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, and `x` is the second element of `num_list`.
