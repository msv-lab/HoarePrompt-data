Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

# Annotated Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 100. The dictionary `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, with each integer's count updated based on its occurrence in the list `a` after all iterations of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the dictionary `cnt` will contain the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: The dictionary `cnt` contains the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`, and the variable `ans` is the sum of each count in `cnt` divided by 3 after all iterations of the loop.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the values in the dictionary cnt divided by 3)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers provided as input and calculates the sum of the counts of each integer in the list, divided by 3. It then prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value, but rather prints the computed result directly.
