Output State: **`index` is 7 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value from `data[index]` to the variable `n`. The other variables (`index`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
