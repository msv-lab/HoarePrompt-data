Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter, `P` is 2, and `M` is 0**.

Explanation: The value of `P` is incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `P` was initially 1 (as it equals '+' which is the condition for `P` being 1), incrementing it by 1 changes its value to 2. The value of `M` is 0 because `P` is now 2, which means `q` does not equal '+', satisfying the condition for `M` being 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
