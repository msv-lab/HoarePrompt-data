Output State: **`prod` is the product of all elements in the list `vals`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), and `vals` is an empty list.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `prod` will have been multiplied by every element in the original `vals` list, resulting in `prod` being the product of all elements in `vals`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. Similarly, `N` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop. The list `vals` becomes empty as each iteration removes the first element until no elements are left.
