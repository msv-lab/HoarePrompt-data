Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in nums:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `nums`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the next element in the list `nums`, and `num_of_lens` was a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 2.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the next element in the list `nums`, it means `x` was the last element processed in the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least one more element left.
   - Therefore, `x` will now be the new element from the list `nums`, and `num_of_lens` will still have the same key-value pair because the loop body did not modify it.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `nums` must have at least one more element left.
   - `x` will be the next element in the list `nums`.
   - `num_of_lens` remains the same, with the key `x` and value 2.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `x` is the next element in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 2**
