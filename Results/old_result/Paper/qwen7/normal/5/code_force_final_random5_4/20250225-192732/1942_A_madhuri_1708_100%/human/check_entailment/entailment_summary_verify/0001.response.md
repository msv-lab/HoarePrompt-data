### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of the \(n\) cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` processes input from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\) from the input.
   - It checks if \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(k = n\), it prints an array where each element is equal to \(k\).
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - If \(k < 2\), it prints an array where each element is its index plus one.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Case \(k = n\):**
     - If \(k = n\), the array must be such that every cyclic shift is sorted. This can only happen if all elements in the array are the same. Hence, printing an array where each element is \(k\) is correct.
   - **Case \(k < n\):**
     - The program incorrectly handles this case by always printing `-1`. However, it is possible to construct an array with fewer than \(n\) sorted cyclic shifts.
     - For example, consider \(n = 3\) and \(k = 1\). An array like `[69420, 69, 420]` has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (`[69, 420, 69420]`), but the program prints `-1`.
   - **Case \(k = 1\):**
     - The example in the problem statement shows that it's possible to have exactly one sorted cyclic shift. The program fails to handle this correctly since it prints `-1` instead of generating a valid array.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For \(k = 1\), we can construct an array where the first element is smaller than the last element and the rest are in increasing order. For example, `[1, 2, 3]` has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (`[1, 2, 3]`).
   - For \(k < n\), we need to ensure that the array has exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts. One way to achieve this is by constructing an array where the first \(k\) elements are in increasing order and the rest are in decreasing order, ensuring that the cyclic shifts up to the \(k\)-th shift are sorted.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is incorrect because it does not generate valid arrays for cases where \(k < n\). Specifically, it incorrectly prints `-1` when \(k < n\).

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not generate valid arrays for cases where \(k < n\).
