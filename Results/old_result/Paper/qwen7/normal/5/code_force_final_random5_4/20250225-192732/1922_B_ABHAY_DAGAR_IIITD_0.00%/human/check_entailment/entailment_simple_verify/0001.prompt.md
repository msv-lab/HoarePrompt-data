You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two elements: an integer n representing the number of sticks, and a list of integers a where each a_i represents the exponent used to calculate the length of the i-th stick as 2^{a_i}.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - For three lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to form a triangle, the triangle inequality must hold: \(a + b > c\), \(a + c > b\), and \(b + c > a\).
   - Given that the length of each stick is \(2^{a_i}\), the triangle inequality simplifies to checking if the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `a_i`.
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count occurrences of each exponent value.
   - The variable `res` is used to store the number of valid triplets.
   - The logic inside the loop:
     - If there are at least 3 sticks with the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 out of these sticks using combinations.
     - If there are at least 2 sticks with the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 out of these sticks and multiply by the number of ways to choose the third stick from the remaining counts.
     - It updates the total count of sticks seen so far.

3. **Checking the Triangle Inequality:**
   - The provided code does not explicitly check the triangle inequality condition. Instead, it assumes that if there are enough sticks of the same length, they can form a triangle, which is not always true. For example, having three sticks of length \(2^3\) (i.e., 8) will not form a triangle because \(8 + 8 \not> 8\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The code does not correctly implement the logic to ensure the triangle inequality condition is met.
   - Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.
