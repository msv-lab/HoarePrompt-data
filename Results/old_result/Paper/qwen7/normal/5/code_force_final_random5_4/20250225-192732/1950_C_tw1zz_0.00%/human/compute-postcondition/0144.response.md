Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the time and is equal to '00', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is equal to '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is a string equal to 'PM'.**

The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
