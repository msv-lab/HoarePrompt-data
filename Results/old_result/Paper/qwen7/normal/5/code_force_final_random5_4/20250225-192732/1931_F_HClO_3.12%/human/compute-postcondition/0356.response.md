Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are either both 0, or one of them is `i` and the other is 0, with `p1` and `p2` being adjusted accordingly (either `p1` is 1 and `p2` is 0, or `p1` is 0 and `p2` is 1); if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
