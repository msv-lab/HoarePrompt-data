### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summaries to validate the original assessment.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise. This function is used correctly in the main logic to check if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
This function attempts to reduce the array according to the specified operations. Here's a detailed breakdown of its behavior:

1. **Loop through the array (excluding the first and last elements)**:
   - For each element `i` (where `1 <= i <= n-2`), it checks if the current element `list[i]` is greater than 1 and if the adjacent elements `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are also greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i+1] -= list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= list[i-1]`
   - If `list[i-1]` is not zero after the operation, it immediately prints "NO" and returns, indicating that the array cannot be reduced to all zeros.

2. **After the loop**:
   - It calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements in the array are zero.
   - Depending on the result, it prints "YES" or "NO".

Given the function summary, we can see that the function `func_2` correctly implements the logic to check if the array can be reduced to all zeros. It ensures that after each operation, the array is still reducible to all zeros by checking the state of the array after each modification. If at any point the array cannot be further reduced, it correctly identifies that the array cannot be made all zeros.

The original assessment suggested that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. However, upon closer inspection, the function `func_2` does indeed handle the case where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros properly. The function checks the state of the array after each operation and ensures that the array remains reducible to all zeros.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and function summaries.
