Postcondition: `left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is adjusted based on whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or not, either decreasing by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0' or remaining the same if it is not. `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', and `rightOne` is increased by 1 while `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0'.
