Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of pairs where each pair consists of two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob; and `sec_arr`, a list of pairs where each pair consists of two integers. It returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of the second elements of all pairs in `main_ar` where the sum of the first elements of the pairs is greater than or equal to 0.**
