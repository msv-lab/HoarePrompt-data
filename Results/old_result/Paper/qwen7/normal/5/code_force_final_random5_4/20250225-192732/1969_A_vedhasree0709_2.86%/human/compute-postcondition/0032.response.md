Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and the conditions `l[i-1] == i + 1` and `l[i-2] == i + 2` are met for some `i` between 0 and `n-1`. Since the `if` condition `j == 0` is met, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition because the `else` part does not exist and the `if` part does not change the values of `i`, `j`, or `n`.
