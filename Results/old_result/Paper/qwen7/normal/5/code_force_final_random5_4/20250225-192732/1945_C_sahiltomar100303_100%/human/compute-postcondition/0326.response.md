Postcondition: `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`. If `left` is not 0, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `left` is 0, the postcondition also remains unchanged regardless of the relationship between `tleftZero` and `(n + 1) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2`, then `right` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `right` becomes equal to `n`.
