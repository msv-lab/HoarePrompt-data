Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is an input integer determined by the length of the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it into a list of characters, and assigns it to the variable `s`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
