Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t`, which is used as the argument for the `range()` function.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Consider the Given State**: The given state is that `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, and `t` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The values of `start` and `end` do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
