Output State: **`k` is the third key in the dictionary `M`, and `cnt` is a list containing the second key of `M`; `cnt` is appended with the current key `k`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt.append(k)` appends the current key `k` (which is now the third key in the dictionary `M`) to the list `cnt`. Since `k` was previously the second key in the dictionary, `cnt` already contains this second key. Now, `cnt` will contain both the second and the third keys of the dictionary `M`.
