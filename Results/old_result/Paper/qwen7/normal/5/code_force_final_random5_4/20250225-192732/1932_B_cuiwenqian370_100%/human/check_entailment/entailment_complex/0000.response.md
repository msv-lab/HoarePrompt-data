Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. It initializes variables properly and iterates through the test cases.
3. For each test case, it calculates the year when the nth sign will occur by iterating through the list of periodicities (`a`) and computing the next occurrence year for each sign.
4. The logic for calculating the next occurrence year is correct. Specifically, it uses the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to ensure the next year is a multiple of `a[i]` and strictly greater than `last_year`.
5. The results are stored in the `results` list and written to stdout at the end.

Given the annotations and the explanation, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
