Output State: **After executing `results.append('YES')`, `results` will contain ['YES'], `reachable_first_row` will be `False`, `reachable_second_row` will be `True`, `row2[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1` will still be '>', and `t` will remain unchanged.**

This means that the list `results` has been updated to include the string `'YES'`, while the boolean values `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged, and the condition `row2[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1` still holds as '>'. The variable `t` is not modified and thus remains unchanged.
