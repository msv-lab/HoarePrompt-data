Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list with at least two elements.
- `result` is the next element in the list `results`.

Since `results` is a list and `result` is described as "the next element in the list `results`," we need to determine what "next" means in this context. Typically, if we are iterating through a list, the "next" element would be the one after the current position. However, without knowing the exact position or any prior elements, we can only describe `result` as the second element in the list, assuming we start counting from the beginning.

Therefore, `result` will be the second element in the list `results`.

Output: **the second element in the list results**
