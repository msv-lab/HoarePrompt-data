You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
    return s



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. It returns a string `s` where each letter from 'a' to 'z' appears a number of times determined by the values in `a` and the increments made to a count array `char_count` during the nested loops. Specifically, for each element `a[i]` in the list `a`, the corresponding lowercase letter is appended to `s` and the count for that letter in `char_count` is incremented. The final string `s` is constructed based on these counts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly generates a string `s` from the provided trace `a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes `n` and `a` as inputs.
   - It initializes an empty string `s` and a list `char_count` to keep track of the count of each character used so far.
   - It iterates through each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
     - For each index `i`, it looks for a character `j` (where `j` ranges from 0 to 25) such that `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`.
     - When it finds such a character, it appends the corresponding lowercase letter to `s` and increments the count of that character in `char_count`.

3. **Character Assignment**:
   - The key part is the condition `if char_count[j] == a[i]:`. 
   - This ensures that the character at position `i` in the string `s` is the same as the character at one of the previous positions specified by `a[i]`.
   - The loop `for j in range(26)` ensures that the first occurrence of a character that satisfies this condition is chosen.

4. **Guaranteed Existence**:
   - The problem guarantees that for each test case, a suitable string `s` exists that matches the given trace `a`.
   - Therefore, the logic of the program should work correctly under these constraints.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1**: `abracadabra`
  - Trace: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`
  - The program will correctly generate "abracadabra" because it follows the trace exactly.

- **Test Case 2**: `codeforces`
  - Trace: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`
  - The program will correctly generate "codeforces" because it follows the trace exactly.

- **Test Case 3**: `a`
  - Trace: `[0]`
  - The program will correctly generate "a" because there are no previous characters to match.

- **Test Case 4**: `aaaaaaa`
  - Trace: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - The program will correctly generate "aaaaaaa" because it follows the trace exactly.

- **Test Case 5**: `dijkstra`
  - Trace: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - The program will correctly generate "dijkstra" because there are no previous characters to match.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to generate a string `s` from the given trace `a`. It handles all test cases as expected.
