Output State: **`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure, `dsu.union(u, v, w)` has been called, updating the parent relationship between `u` and `v`.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` function call unites nodes `u` and `v` in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure with the edge weight `w`. This operation updates the parent relationships such that `u` and `v` are connected under the same set, and `w` is the weight of the edge connecting them. The other variables remain unchanged.
