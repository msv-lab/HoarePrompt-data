Output State: `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the final value it reaches after the loop completes, `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated within the loop plus any additional 1s added based on the conditions met during each iteration.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `a` stays as the initial integer provided in `info[0]`. The variable `b` will be the highest integer value it reached during the loop's execution, which is determined by the loop's range. The variable `suma` accumulates the value of `x` for each iteration where the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` is met, and additionally increments by 1 whenever both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are satisfied for any `i` within the loop's range.
