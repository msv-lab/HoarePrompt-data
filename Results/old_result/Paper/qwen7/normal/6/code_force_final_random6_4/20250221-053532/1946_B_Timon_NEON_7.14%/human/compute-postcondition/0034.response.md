Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list containing either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0` or `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], max_segment[1]]` if `arr[i] < 0`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the first element of `max_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to it. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`. If `arr[i]` is negative, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], max_segment[1]]`.
