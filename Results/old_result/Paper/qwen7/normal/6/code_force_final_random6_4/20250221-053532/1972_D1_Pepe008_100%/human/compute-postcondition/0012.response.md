Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is `x` + 1, and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and the current value of `x` satisfies `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0)`**.

Explanation: The line `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. Since `suma` was previously equal to `x`, after this operation, `suma` becomes `x + 1`. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
