Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer**

Explanation: The code `b = int(b)` converts the string `b` into an integer. Since `b` was originally a string, now it is converted to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
