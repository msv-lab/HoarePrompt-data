Output State: **`total` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 3, `values[0]` is 0, `values[3]` is 3, `sum_values[2]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `values[i] = i` updates the list `values` such that the element at index `i` (which is 3) is set to the value of `i` (which is 3). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
