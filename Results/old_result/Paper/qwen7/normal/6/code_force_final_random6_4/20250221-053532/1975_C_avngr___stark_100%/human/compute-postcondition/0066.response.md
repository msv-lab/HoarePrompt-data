The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, `temp`, and the loop itself remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `max` is the second largest value among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`, `max` is updated to the maximum second largest value found during the entire execution of the loop, `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing three consecutive elements, and `temp` is sorted after each iteration.**
