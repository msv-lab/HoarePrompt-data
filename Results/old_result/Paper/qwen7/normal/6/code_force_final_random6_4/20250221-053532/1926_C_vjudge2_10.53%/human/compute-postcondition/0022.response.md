Output State: **`total` is 4, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 3, `values[0]` is 0, `values[3]` is 3, `sum_values[2]` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `total` is incremented by `i`, which was initially 3. Therefore, `total` becomes 4. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
