Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 0)`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2 - 0`, `g` is now `n / 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `n / count`. Given that `count` is 2, `g` becomes `n / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
