Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `lst` is modified to remove the element at index `0 * 2`.**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state includes `n > 0`, `i = n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and `lst` is modified to remove the element at index `0 * 2`.
2. The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2` from the list `lst`. Since `1 * 2` equals `2`, the element at index `2` is removed from `lst`.
3. No other variables are affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with the only change being the removal of the element at index `2` from `lst`.
