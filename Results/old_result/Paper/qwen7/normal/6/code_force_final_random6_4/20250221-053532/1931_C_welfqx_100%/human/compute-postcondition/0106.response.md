Output State: **`r` is 0, `n` is 1 or `f` is 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1**.

Explanation: The line `f = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `f`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
