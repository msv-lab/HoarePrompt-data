Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `start`, `end`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
