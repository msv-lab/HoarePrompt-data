Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head does not explicitly mention any variables, but it uses `remainder_steps` to determine the number of iterations. Therefore, the key variable here is `remainder_steps`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `remainder_steps`:**
   - From the given state before the loop, `remainder_steps` is defined as `remaining_steps % cycle_length`.
   - This means `remainder_steps` is the remainder when `remaining_steps` is divided by `cycle_length`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0. If `remainder_steps` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `remainder_steps` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`
- `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`
- `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`
- `score` is increased by `full_cycles * cycle_score`
- `cycle_score` will be increased by the sum of the values of `a` from each position within the cycle, as determined by the permutation `p`
- `cycle_pos` will be updated to the final position within the cycle after all iterations

However, since the loop condition depends on `remainder_steps`, we only need to ensure that `remainder_steps` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length` and must be greater than 0, `score` is increased by `full_cycles * cycle_score`, `cycle_score` will be increased by the sum of the values of `a` from each position within the cycle, as determined by the permutation `p`, `cycle_pos` will be updated to the final position within the cycle after all iterations**
