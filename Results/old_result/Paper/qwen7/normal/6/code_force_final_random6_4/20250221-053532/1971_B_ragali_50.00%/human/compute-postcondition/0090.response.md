Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is the first character in the string `s.strip()`.
- `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s.strip()`.
- `newstr` is either an empty string or equal to `s.strip()` and the length of the set `a` is less than or equal to 1.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
