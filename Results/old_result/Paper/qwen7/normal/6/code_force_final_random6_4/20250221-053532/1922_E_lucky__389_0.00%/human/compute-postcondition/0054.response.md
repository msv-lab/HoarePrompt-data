Output State: **`i` is 10, `x` is 983, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10, `mx` is 10**.

Explanation: The code `mx = max(mx, i)` assigns the maximum value between `mx` (which is initially undefined or considered as negative infinity) and `i` (which is 10) to `mx`. Since `i` is 10 and there's no initial value given for `mx`, `mx` will be set to 10. The other variables (`i`, `x`, and `subseq_lens`) remain unchanged.
