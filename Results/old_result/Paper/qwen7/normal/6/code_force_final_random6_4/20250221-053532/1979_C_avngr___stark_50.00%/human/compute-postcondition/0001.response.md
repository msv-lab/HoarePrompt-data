Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `num in numbers[1:]`. This means the loop variable `num` will take values from the second element onwards of the list `numbers`.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `hcf` is equal to the first element of the list `numbers`.
   - `numbers` is a list containing \(n\) integers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\) where \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\) for all \(i\).

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, the list `numbers` must contain at least two elements because the loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop starts from the second element of the list `numbers`, the list `numbers` must have at least two elements.
   - The variable `hcf` is already set to the first element of the list `numbers`, so no adjustment is needed for `hcf`.
   - The variable `num` will start with the second element of the list `numbers`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `numbers` must have at least two elements.
- `num` should start with the second element of the list `numbers`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `hcf` is equal to the first element of the list `numbers`, `numbers` must have at least two elements, and `num` is the second element of the list `numbers`.**
