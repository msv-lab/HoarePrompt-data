Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `ii` will be `n-2`, `ck` will be the count of consecutive pairs of elements in `onum` that are the same, and `cn` will be incremented by `ck`. The value of `n` will remain unchanged, and the other variables (`r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`) will retain their values from the initial state or as described in the postconditions after 3 iterations. Additionally, within the if condition, `symb1` is equal to `symb2`.**

In this output state, the variable `cn` is incremented by the value of `ck`, which is the count of consecutive identical pairs in the list `onum`. All other variables retain their values from the initial state or as specified after 3 iterations, and the conditions within the if statement remain unchanged.
