Output State: **`t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a - t1` to `t2`. Since `t1` is already defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is updated to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
