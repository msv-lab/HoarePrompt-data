Output State: **`i` is 3; `dp` is a list containing one element which is (0 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 0) % 1000000007**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 3 and `dp` is an empty list. The code appends a new element to `dp`. The new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Since `dp` is initially empty, `dp[-1]` and `dp[-2]` both evaluate to 0. Thus, the new element is `(0 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 0) % 1000000007`, which simplifies to `0`. Therefore, `dp` now contains `[0]`.
