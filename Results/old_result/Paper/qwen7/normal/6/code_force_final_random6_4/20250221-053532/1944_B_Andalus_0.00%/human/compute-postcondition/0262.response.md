Output State: **`sz` is 0, `sng` is a fully iterated iterable, `elem` is the last element of `sng`, `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sz`, `sng`, `elem`, and `rdb`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within, which in this case is implied to be a loop or conditional that was iterating over `sng`. The precondition that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` remains unchanged as no operation affecting `sz` or `k` is performed.
