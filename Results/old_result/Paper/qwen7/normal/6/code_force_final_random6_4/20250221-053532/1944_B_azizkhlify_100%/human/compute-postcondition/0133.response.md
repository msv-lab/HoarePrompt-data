Output State: **`i` is `a[0]`, `res` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 1`, `ur` is the total count of elements in `r` that correspond to indices `a[i] - 1` where `i` ranges from `n` to `2 * n - 1` and were set to 0.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input and splits them using `input().split()`. These values are then converted to integers using a list comprehension. The values of `i`, `res`, `ur`, and the original value of `k` remain unchanged. The new value of `k` is `k - 1`, and `n` is the input integer.
