Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `remaining_cells` is \(15 \times (\text{y} // 2 \text{ or } \text{y} // 2 + 1) - \text{space_y}\)
- `space_x` is equal to `x`
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`
- `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`
- `t` retains its initial value
- `n` retains its initial value
- `result` is a list
- If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`, where `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`, or `extra_space // 15` otherwise, and `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`.
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer

### Loop Head
```
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `_` is used, which means the loop does not depend on any specific variable being incremented or modified within the loop.
- The only variables that can change within the loop are those that are modified inside the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, no changes are made to the variables.

### States to Adjust
Since no variables are modified within the loop, the states of the variables remain the same from the previous iteration to the next iteration.

### Final State
- `remaining_cells` remains the same
- `space_x` remains the same
- `space_y` remains the same
- `total_space` remains the same
- `t` retains its initial value
- `n` retains its initial value
- `result` remains the same
- `x` remains the same
- `y` remains the same

### Answer
State: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * (`y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1) - `space_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
