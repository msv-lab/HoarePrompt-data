The function processes two lists of non-negative integers, `a` and `b`, of length `n`, along with two positive integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200000\)). It calculates the cumulative sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. If `i < m`, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum value between its current value and `x + a[i]`. Finally, it prints the updated `pergunta`, which holds the smallest value obtained from `x + a[i]` for all valid `i` (where `i < m`). The function does not return any value; it modifies `pergunta` and prints its final value.
