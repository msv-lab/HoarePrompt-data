Output State: **`s` is False, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` remains unchanged, `x` is equal to the last element of `lst[x]` after popping, and `lst[x]` now contains one less element, `x` is equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`. The value of `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping, which means `x` is now equal to this last element. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
