Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input from standard input. It reads an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of integers n and k, followed by two lines of integers. For each test case, it returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly accepts input through standard input, specifically an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set includes integers `n` and `k`, and two lines of `n` integers. The function then processes these inputs according to specified rules and returns a result for each test case.
