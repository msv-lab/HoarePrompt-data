Output State: **`full_cycles` remains unchanged, `remaining_steps` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is decreased by 1, `score` is increased by `a[current_pos - 1]`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `current_pos` is updated to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`**

This output state reflects that the `score` is increased by the value of `a[current_pos - 1]`, and `current_pos` is updated to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`. All other variables (`full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `remainder_steps`, `cycle_score`) remain unchanged.
