Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3, and the first element is 0.**

Explanation: The code `nums.insert(0, 0)` inserts the value `0` at index `0` in the list `nums`. Since `nums` was originally a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 2, after inserting `0` at the beginning, the new length of `nums` is greater than 3, and the first element of `nums` is now `0`. All other elements remain sorted and unchanged.
