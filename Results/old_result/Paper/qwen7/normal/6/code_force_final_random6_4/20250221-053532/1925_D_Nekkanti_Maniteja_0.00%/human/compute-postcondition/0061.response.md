Output State: **`i` is less than `m`, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \((n * (n - 1)) // 1\) modulo \(1000000007\), `M` is \(1000000007\), `s` is 0, `a` is increased by `f`, `u`, and `v`, `f` is an integer input from the user, `u` is an integer input from the user, `v` is an integer input from the user, `u` is the second integer input, `v` is the third integer input, `f` is the fourth integer input.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The values of other variables (`i`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `M`, `s`, `a`) remain unchanged.
