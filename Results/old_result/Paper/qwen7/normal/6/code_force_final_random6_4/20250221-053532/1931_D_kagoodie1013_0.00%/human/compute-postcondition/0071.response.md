Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `count` is increased by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code increments `count` by the value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`. Since `mod_x` is not defined in the current context, `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` returns 0. The value of `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` (which is the last element of `arr`) is divided by `y`. Therefore, `count` is increased by the value of `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, which could be 0 if `mod_y` is not a key in `mod_y_map`.
