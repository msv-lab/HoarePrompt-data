Output State: `t` is 9999, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the maximum value of `b` passed into the loop, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, and `suma` is the cumulative sum of all `x` values that satisfy the conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` throughout the loop's iterations.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to the total number of inputs processed, which is 9999 given the constraint `1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4`. The variable `a` retains its initial value as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `b` will be set to the highest value it reached during the loop's execution, and `i` will be one more than the final value of `b`. The variable `x` is calculated based on the last iteration's values, and `suma` accumulates the value of `x` for each iteration of the loop, adding 1 to `suma` if the specific condition is met for any `i`.
