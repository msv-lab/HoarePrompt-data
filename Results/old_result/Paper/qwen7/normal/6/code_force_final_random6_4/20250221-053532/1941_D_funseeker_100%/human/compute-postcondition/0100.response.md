Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_1()` and `func_3()`. It processes the results from `func_1()` which provide the distance and direction for each throw, and `func_3()` which provides the number of players, number of throws, and the initial player. Based on this information, it performs some operations and returns a set of players who have the ball at the end.**

Note: The actual operations and logic within the function are not described here, only the parameters it indirectly uses and the expected return type.
