Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the hour is 12 in the 24-hour format. According to the problem description, 12 in the 24-hour format should be represented as 12 in the 12-hour format during the AM period and as 00 in the PM period. However, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' when `h` is 12, regardless of whether it should be AM or PM. This leads to incorrect output for times like "12:00".

For example, for the input "12:00", the program outputs "00:00 PM", which is incorrect. It should output "12:00 PM" for the PM period and "12:00 AM" for the AM period.
