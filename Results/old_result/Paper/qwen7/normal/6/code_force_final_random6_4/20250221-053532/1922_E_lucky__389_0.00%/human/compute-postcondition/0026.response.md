Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is at least 1023.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop condition involves `i` and `x`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables.
   - We need to ensure that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` holds true for the next iteration.

4. **Calculate the new values**:
   - Given `i = 1`, `2 ** (i + 1) = 2 ** 2 = 4`.
   - For the loop to continue, `x + 1` must be at least 4. Since `x` is at least 1023, `x + 1` is at least 1024, which is much larger than 4. Therefore, the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` is already satisfied.
   - To ensure the loop continues, we need to increment `i` by 1. Thus, `i` should be set to 2.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` must be set to 2.
   - `x` remains at least 1023.
   - `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `subseq_lens` remains an empty list.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is at least 1023, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**
