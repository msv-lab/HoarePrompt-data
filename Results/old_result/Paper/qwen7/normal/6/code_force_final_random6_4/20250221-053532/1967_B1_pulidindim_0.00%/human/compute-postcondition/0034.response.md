Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n + (n / 3 - 0) / 3 + 1 + (n / 5 - 1) / 6 + 2 + (n / 7 - 2) / 8 + ... + (n / count - (count-3)) / count + (count-3)`, `countmins` is `count - 3`, and `g` is `n / (count - 1) - (count - 3)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `count` will be equal to `m + 1`. The value of `ans` will be updated in each iteration based on the formula given by the loop. Specifically, for each `count` from 2 to `m`, `ans` is incremented by `g / count + 1`, where `g` is adjusted in each iteration. The final value of `ans` is the sum of these increments starting from the initial value of `n`.
