Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is equal to `n * 2 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`**.

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `t`. Therefore, the updated state includes `ans` being set to 0, while `i`, `n`, and `t` retain their original conditions.
