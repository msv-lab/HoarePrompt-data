Postcondition: **`can_survive` remains False, `bullets_used` is `health + health`, `monsters` remains a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `health` is the health of the next monster, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
