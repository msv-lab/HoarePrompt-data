Output State: **`i` is 1; `b` is a list with at least one element, and the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the previous value of `b[i - 1]`; `s` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by 1, starting from an initial value implied to be 0 (since no initial value is given for `s`). The values of `i` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
