The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \), a positive integer \( n \), and two binary strings \( s \) and \( f \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state \( s \) into the desired state \( f \). The function returns the total number of operations needed across all test cases.
