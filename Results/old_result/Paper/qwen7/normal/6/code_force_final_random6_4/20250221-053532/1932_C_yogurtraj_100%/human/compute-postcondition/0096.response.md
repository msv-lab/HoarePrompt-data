Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `k` is the final value of `k` after the loop completes, which is determined by the sequence of operations inside the loop based on the characters in `t` and the values in `a`.
- `y` is a list where each element from index `0` to `n-2` (inclusive) is updated to the current value of `k` after the corresponding iteration of the loop.

The `print(*y)` statement will print the list `y` with each element separated by a space. Since `i` is `-1`, it means the loop has run from `n-2` down to `0`, updating `y` with the value of `k` at each step.

Given that the exact values of `t` and `a` are not specified, we can only describe the final state of `y` based on the operations performed during the loop.

Output: **[k k ... k] (where k is the final value of k after the loop completes, and there are n-1 elements in the list y)**
