### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values for \( n \), \( k \), \( pb \) (Bodya's starting position), \( ps \) (Sasha's starting position), the permutation \( p \), and the array \( a \).
   - It adjusts the indices of \( p \) and \( a \) to be zero-based by subtracting 1 from each element. This is crucial because the permutation and array indices start from 1 in the problem statement, but the program assumes they start from 0.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha, passing the necessary parameters. This function is responsible for calculating the maximum possible score for a given starting position.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes variables to keep track of the maximum score (`mx`), the current score (`cur`), and a visited array (`vis`) to avoid revisiting positions.
   - It iteratively updates the score and moves through the permutation until it either runs out of moves (`k <= 0`) or visits all positions.
   - The function returns the maximum score achievable from the given starting position.

4. **Score Comparison**:
   - After calculating the scores for both players using `func_1`, the program compares the scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If Bodya's score is greater, it prints 'Bodya'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Sasha'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the scores are equal by printing 'Draw'.
   - It correctly identifies when Bodya has a higher score and when Sasha has a higher score.
   - The logic for determining the winner is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

However, there is a critical issue with the initial assessment. The program assumes that the starting positions \( pb \) and \( ps \) are already zero-based, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The problem specifies that the starting positions are 1-based, but the program uses them directly without adjustment.

### Corrected Analysis:

- **Problem Statement vs. Program Logic**:
  - The problem states that the starting positions \( pb \) and \( ps \) are 1-based, but the program uses them as-is without adjusting them to 0-based indices.
  - For example, if \( pb = 3 \), the program will use index 2 in the permutation and array, which might lead to incorrect behavior if the permutation or array does not support such an index.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program does not correctly handle the 1-based starting positions. The program should adjust these positions to 0-based indices before calling `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
