Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `x`. The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
