Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values and Conditions**:
   - `ind` is calculated as `1 + n % 2`.
   - `p` is an empty list.
   - `i` is initially 0.
   - `n` is greater than the current value of `i + 2`.
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than the current value of `i + 2`.
   - After all iterations, `i` will be `n - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n - 2` if `n` is even.
   - `ind` will be `t - (n - i)`.
   - For each even index `i` up to `n - 2` (inclusive), the list `p` will have its corresponding index set to `ind - 2*i`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and the loop condition is `n > i + 2`, the initial value of `i` should be 0, but we need to ensure that the loop can start. This means `n` must be at least 3 (since `n > 0 + 2`).
   - The value of `ind` is `1 + n % 2`, so this doesn't need adjustment since it's derived from `n`.
   - The list `p` is initially empty and will be modified within the loop, so no initial state needs to be set for `p`.
   - The final values of `i` and `ind` depend on the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust these until after the loop.

Given the above points, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2**
