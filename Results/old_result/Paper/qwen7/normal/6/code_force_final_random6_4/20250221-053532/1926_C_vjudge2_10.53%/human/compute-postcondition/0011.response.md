Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, and each element in `numbers` is one of the input integers `n`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must still be greater than 0 (ensuring at least one iteration occurred). The variable `n` represents each individual integer input during the iterations. The list `numbers` will contain exactly `t` elements, with each element being one of the integers `n` that were input during the loop's execution.
