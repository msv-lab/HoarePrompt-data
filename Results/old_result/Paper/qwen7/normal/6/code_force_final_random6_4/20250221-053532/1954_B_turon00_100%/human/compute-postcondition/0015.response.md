Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `cnt` is 0
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 1 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and `cnt` is 0.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - The values of `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged unless the condition inside the loop body is met, but since no specific loop body is provided, we assume they stay as they are.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
   - `cnt` and `ans` remain as they were (0 and the previously computed value, respectively).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 1 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and `cnt` is 0.**
