Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `lst` is modified by removing the element at index 1 (since `1 * 2` equals 2)**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst`. Initially, `lst` was modified to remove the element at index 0, so now it further modifies `lst` by removing the element at index 2. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
