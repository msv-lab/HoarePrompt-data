Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `a` is the stripped input string, `n` is the integer value of the stripped input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `a`. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `n`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
