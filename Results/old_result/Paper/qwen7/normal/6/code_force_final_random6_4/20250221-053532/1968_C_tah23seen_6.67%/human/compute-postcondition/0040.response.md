Output State: **`ans[length_of_arr - 1]` is now `ans[length_of_arr - 2] + arr[length_of_arr - 1]`, and `i` is -1.**

Explanation: The code updates the last element of the `ans` array by adding the last element of the `arr` array to the second last element of the `ans` array. The variable `i` is not affected by this line of code and remains -1.
