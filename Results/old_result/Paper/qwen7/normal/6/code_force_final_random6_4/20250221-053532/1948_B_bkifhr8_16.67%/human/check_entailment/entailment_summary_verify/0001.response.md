### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to confirm the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element (`p`). It checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, the program attempts to split the previous element into its individual digits and insert them back into the array at the appropriate positions. However, the current implementation is flawed because:
     - It directly modifies the array by popping and inserting elements without ensuring the digits are inserted in the correct positions.
     - The logic for splitting and inserting digits is not robust and does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after the operation.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This function works correctly by comparing the original list with its sorted version.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order and returns the appropriate boolean value.

### Detailed Issues

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits:**
   - The current implementation of splitting digits and inserting them back into the array is flawed. The program does not ensure that the digits are inserted in the correct positions, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Assumption of Immediate Sorting:**
   - The program assumes that after performing the digit-splitting operation, the array will be sorted immediately. However, this is not always true because the relative order of other elements in the array may still be incorrect.

3. **Lack of Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with leading zeros or negative numbers, which are not specified in the problem but could affect the sorting process.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the digit-splitting operation is performed in a way that maintains the correct relative order of elements. Here is a revised approach:

1. **Splitting Digits:**
   - When an element is split, the digits should be inserted in the correct positions to maintain the relative order of other elements.

2. **Iterative Processing:**
   - We need to iterate through the array multiple times until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        
        changed = False
        for p in range(1, len(list1)):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] >= 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
                changed = True
        
        if not changed:
            print('No')
            break
```

This revised program ensures that the digit-splitting operation is performed correctly and iteratively until the array is sorted or no more changes can be made.

### Final Evaluation

Given the detailed analysis and the corrected solution, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for splitting and inserting digits.

Final: **False**
