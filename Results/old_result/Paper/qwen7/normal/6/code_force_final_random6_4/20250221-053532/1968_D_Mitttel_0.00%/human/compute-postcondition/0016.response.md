Output State: **`index` is 18 + n + n, `PB` is an integer value from `data[5]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `PS` is an integer value from `data[8]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we know that the function call assigns its return value to the variable `result`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
