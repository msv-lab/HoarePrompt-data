Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i`, `len(num)`, and the range parameters.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will run as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - The starting value of `i` is `len(num) - 1`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - Since `i` starts at `len(num) - 1`, we need to ensure that `len(num) - 1` is a valid starting point for the loop.
   - For the loop to start, `len(num)` must be at least 1 (since `len(num) - 1` must be non-negative).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `len(num)` is at least 1.
   - The variable `i` will start at `len(num) - 1`, but since we are not directly adjusting `i`, we focus on ensuring the condition for the loop to start.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - The initial state of `counter` is 0, and `num` is an integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`.
   - To ensure the loop starts, `len(num)` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the final state adjustment required for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`counter` is 0, `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, and `len(num)` must be at least 1**.
