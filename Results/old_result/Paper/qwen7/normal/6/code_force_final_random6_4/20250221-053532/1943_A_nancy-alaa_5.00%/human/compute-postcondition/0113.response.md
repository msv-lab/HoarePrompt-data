Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`. If the current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1 and `first` is True, then the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs if the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is not met.
