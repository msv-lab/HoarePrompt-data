Output State: **`i` is length_of_arr - 2; `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous value of `ans[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` to be the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous value of `ans[i + 1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `length_of_arr - 2`. Therefore, `ans[i + 1]` now holds the new value which is the sum of `arr[i]` and its previous value.
