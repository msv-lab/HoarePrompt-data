Output State: **`sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `sz >= k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the given code snippet, the only change is that the program will exit the loop or conditional block it was in. The conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged.
