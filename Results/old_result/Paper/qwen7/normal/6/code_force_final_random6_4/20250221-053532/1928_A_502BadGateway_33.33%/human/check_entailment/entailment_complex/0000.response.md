Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- The provided solution checks if \(b\) is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise.
- However, this logic is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly. Here's why:

1. **Cutting and Rearrangement**: 
   - If \(b\) is even, cutting the \(a \times b\) rectangle along the width (i.e., \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\)) results in two rectangles of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of dimensions \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\), which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle unless \(a = b\).

2. **Edge Case**:
   - When \(a = b\), the original rectangle is a square. Cutting it into two equal parts results in two smaller squares, which can only be rearranged to form the original square. Hence, no new rectangle can be formed.

3. **General Case**:
   - If \(b\) is odd, cutting the rectangle along either dimension won't result in two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle, except for the trivial case where \(a = b\) and the rectangle is a square.

Given this analysis, the provided function `func_1` is incorrect because:
- It only checks if \(b\) is even, which is insufficient.
- It fails to account for the edge case where \(a = b\) and the rectangle is a square.

To fix this, we need to check if \(a \neq b\) when \(b\) is even, and also handle the case where \(a = b\).

Correctness: **False**
