### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability of each ship into a list `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes `n`, `k`, and `nums` as parameters.
   - It converts `nums` into a deque for efficient popping from both ends.
   - It initializes `ans` to count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than 0 and there are at least 2 ships left (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements of the deque, denoted as `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between `a` and `b` and checks if `k` is sufficient to reduce both durabilities by this minimum value.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the minimum durability, it reduces `a` and `b` by this value, decrements `k` by twice the minimum durability, and appends the non-zero values back to the deque.
   - If `k` is insufficient, the loop breaks.
   - After each reduction, it increments `ans` by 1 for each ship that has sunk (i.e., its durability is reduced to 0).

4. **Final Check**:
   - After exiting the loop, if there is one ship left and `k` is still sufficient to sink it, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns `ans`.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Durability Reduction**: The program correctly reduces the durability of the first and last ships in each iteration.
- **Sinking Ships**: The program correctly increments `ans` whenever a ship's durability reaches 0.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **All Ships Sunk Early**: If all ships sink before `k` attacks are completed, the program correctly counts the number of sunk ships.
  - **Single Ship Remaining**: The final check ensures that if the last ship can still be sunk by the remaining `k` attacks, it is counted.

### Correctness Verification

- **Initial Durabilities**: The program correctly handles the initial durabilities of the ships.
- **Attacks**: The program correctly simulates the attacks by reducing the durability of the first and last ships in each iteration.
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles scenarios where all ships sink early and where the last ship can still be sunk by the remaining attacks.

### Conclusion

After re-analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program accurately simulates the attacks and counts the number of sunk ships.

**Correctness: True**

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
