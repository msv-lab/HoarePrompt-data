Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and a (a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range n). It returns the total number of valid operations performed, denoted as 'sunks', which ranges from 0 to a maximum based on the initial conditions and the value of 'k'.**
