Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` containing `n-1` integers (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive) and an integer `n`. It calculates a new list `ans` where each element is derived based on the previous elements and the corresponding elements in `arr`. Specifically, it starts by setting `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`, then iteratively computes each subsequent element in `ans` by adding the current element in `arr` to the previous element in `ans`, and adjusting the value if necessary to ensure it is greater than the corresponding element in `arr`. Finally, it returns the last element of `ans`, which is the sum of the second last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.**
