Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[3]`, `x` is infinity, `y` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` (where `i` is 3) to the list `b`. Since `b` was initially empty, after appending `lit[3]`, `b` now contains one element, which is `lit[3]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. According to the postconditions, since `b` is no longer empty, `x` remains infinity, and `y` remains infinity because there is no last element in `a` to assign to `y`.
