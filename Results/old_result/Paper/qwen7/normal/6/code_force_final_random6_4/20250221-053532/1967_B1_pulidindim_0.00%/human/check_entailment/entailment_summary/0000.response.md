Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `m`. This part matches the problem description.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program initializes `count` to 2 and sets `ans` to `n`.
   - It then enters a while loop where `count` is incremented until it exceeds `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - It computes `g` as `n / count` and checks if `g` is less than `countmins`. If so, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the condition is not met, it adjusts `g` by subtracting `countmins` and then adds `g / count + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints the integer value of `ans`.

Now, let's compare this logic with the problem requirements:
- The problem requires counting ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The given program does not directly implement the required logic for checking the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it seems to be implementing a different formula which might not correctly count the valid pairs.

Given the discrepancy between the problem statement and the implemented logic, we need to verify if the provided solution actually counts the correct number of valid pairs. Based on the example cases provided in the problem statement, the given program does not produce the correct results for the examples.

Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
