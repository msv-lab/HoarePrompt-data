Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and `maxi`, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its previous value, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum of the current value of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`. It also updates `c` by adding `ele` to its previous value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
