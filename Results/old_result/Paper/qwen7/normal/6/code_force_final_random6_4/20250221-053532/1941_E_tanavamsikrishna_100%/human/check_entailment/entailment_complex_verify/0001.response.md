### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The first support cost is set to 1.
   - The next `d-1` positions are incremented by 2 because the distance between the first support and these positions is 1, and we need to add an additional support at each position.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is created with the initial costs and their indices.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - For each subsequent position `i` from `d` to the end of the row:
     - The smallest cost from the heap is removed until the index is greater than `i - (d + 2)`. This ensures that the distance between the current position and the last support in the heap is at least `d`.
     - The new cost for the current position `i` is calculated as the popped cost plus the original depth plus 1, and it is pushed back into the heap.
     - The updated cost is also pushed into the heap.

4. **Return the Last Cost**:
   - The last element in the row will be the minimum cost for the entire row.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - Read the depth values for each row.

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Row**:
   - Use `func_1` to compute the minimum cost for each row.

3. **Calculate Total Costs for Consecutive Rows**:
   - Compute the sum of costs for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Find Minimum Total Cost**:
   - Find the minimum sum among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Heap Usage**:
   - The use of a min-heap is correct for maintaining the minimum cost within the required distance constraint.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The logic for updating costs and maintaining the heap is sound and correctly implements the constraints.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input parsing and output printing are handled correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the row length might be less than `d` or when `k` is 1.

### Specific Concerns

- **Heap Operations**: The heap operations seem correct, but let's verify the logic inside the loop.
- **Distance Constraint**: Ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

#### Detailed Walkthrough

1. **Initialization**:
   - `row[0] = 1`: This initializes the first support cost.
   - `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2`: This initializes the next `d-1` positions.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - `min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]`: This creates a min-heap with the initial costs and their indices.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - For each `i` from `d` to the end of the row:
     - `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass`: This removes the smallest cost from the heap until the index is greater than `i - (d + 2)`.
     - `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`: This calculates the new cost for the current position.
     - `heappush(min_heap, e)`: This pushes the updated cost back into the heap.
     - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`: This pushes the updated cost and index into the heap.

4. **Return the Last Cost**:
   - `return row[-1]`: This returns the last element of the updated `row` list.

### Correctness of the Original Assessment

The original assessment correctly identified that the program implements the logic correctly. However, there is a minor concern about the heap operations. Specifically, the condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass` should ensure that the distance between the current position and the last support in the heap is at least `d`. This condition is crucial to maintain the distance constraint.

Given that the logic and the heap operations are correctly implemented, and the original assessment correctly identified the overall correctness, we can conclude that the program is indeed correct.
