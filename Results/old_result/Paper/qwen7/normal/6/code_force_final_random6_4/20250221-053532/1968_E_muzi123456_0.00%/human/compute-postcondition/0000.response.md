Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\) remains valid. Additionally, the precondition for `n` is introduced, stating that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\), but `n` is not yet defined or assigned a value in the given code snippet.
