Postcondition: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3 and the first element is 0, `i` is 0 or 1, and the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is either 1 or not 1. If the difference is 1, `cd` is set to 1; otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
