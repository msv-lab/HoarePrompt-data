Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` is a list containing elements that satisfy the conditions defined within the loop, `x` is the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, and `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`. The variable `s` is initialized to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is `len(a) - 1`, and `s` is 1. If the value of `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then the condition holds as is. There is no else part provided, so no additional changes occur if the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is `len(a) - 1`, `s` is 2. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is `len(a) - 1`, `s` is 3. If `a[3]` is greater than `a[2]`, then `s` remains 3. There is no else part in the code, so no additional changes occur if the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
