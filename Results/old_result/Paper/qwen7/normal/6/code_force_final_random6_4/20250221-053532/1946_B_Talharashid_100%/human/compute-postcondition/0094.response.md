Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `maxi` will hold the maximum value of `c` across all test cases, `c` will be 0 (as it is reset to 0 after processing all elements in the list `l` for each test case), `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases `t`, `n` will be the last value of `n` input from the last test case, `k` will be the last value of `k` input from the last test case, and `l` will be an empty list since all elements have been processed for all test cases.

The expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` will be evaluated using the final values of `maxi`, `k`, and the sum of all `l` lists combined across all test cases.
