Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3 and the first element is 0.
   - `i` is 0 or 1.
   - The difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is either 1 or not 1.
   - If the difference is 1, `cd` is set to 1; otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(nums) - 2`.

5. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1.

6. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1.

7. **Check the Condition:**
   - The loop will continue if `i < len(nums) - 2`.
   - Since `len(nums) > 3`, `len(nums) - 2` is at least 1.
   - If `i` is 1, then `i < len(nums) - 2` is true, and the loop will continue.
   - If `i` is 2, then `i < len(nums) - 2` is still true as long as `len(nums) > 4`.

8. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - If `i` was 0, it becomes 1.
   - If `i` was 1, it becomes 2.

9. **Post-Condition:**
   - The post-condition remains the same for `nums` and `cd` since they are not directly modified within the loop head.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3 and the first element is 0, `i` is 1 or 2, and the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is either 1 or not 1. If the difference is 1, `cd` is set to 1; otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
