Output State: **`cw` is False, `nw` is False, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`**

Explanation: Initially, `cw` is a boolean flag that is set to `False` if `nums[i]` is equal to 1, and `True` otherwise. Also, `nw` is equal to `cw`, and `i` is `len(nums) - 3`. After executing `cw = not nw`, since `nw` is equal to `cw`, and `cw` is initially either `True` or `False` depending on the condition, `cw` becomes the opposite of its initial value. Given the initial conditions, `nw` remains the same as `cw`, and `i` does not change. Therefore, `cw` is now `False` (assuming it was `True` initially, the opposite would also be true based on the initial condition), `nw` is `False`, and `i` remains `len(nums) - 3`.
