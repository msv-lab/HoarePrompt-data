Postcondition: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding v, `d` is n-3, `u` is equal to `func_1(n-3)`, `v` is a value returned by `func_1(d)`, and `path` contains v and u. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition if `v == 0`.**
