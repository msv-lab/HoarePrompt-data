Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is `idx - 1`
   - `cnt` is `v[0]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be 1) must still be less than `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `n` must remain `idx - 1` for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains `idx - 1`.
   - `cnt` is not affected by the loop and remains `v[0]`.

So, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `idx - 1`, `cnt` is `v[0]`**
