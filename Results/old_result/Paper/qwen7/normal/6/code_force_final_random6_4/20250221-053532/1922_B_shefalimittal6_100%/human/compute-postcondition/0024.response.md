Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` must be a positive integer, `idx` will be increased by `n`, `x` will be the integer from `data[idx]` for each iteration, `v[x]` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `data`.

This means that `idx` will point to the position in `data` that is `n` positions ahead of where it started, and the list `v` will contain the count of each integer value found in `data` up to the `n`-th element.
