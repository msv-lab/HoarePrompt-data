Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `lit[3]` is greater than `x`, then `a` is a list with its last element being `a[3]`. Otherwise, `b` is a list with its last element being `a[3]`.
