Output: **res (where res is the total count of zeros in the list `a`)**

Explanation:
- The loop continues iterating until `i` equals the length of the list `a`.
- During each iteration, the loop checks if the current element `a[i]` is zero.
- If it is zero, the counter `res` is incremented.
- Once `i` reaches the length of `a`, the loop stops, and `res` holds the total count of zeros in the list `a`.
- The `print(res)` statement outputs the value stored in `res`, which is the total count of zeros in the list `a`.
