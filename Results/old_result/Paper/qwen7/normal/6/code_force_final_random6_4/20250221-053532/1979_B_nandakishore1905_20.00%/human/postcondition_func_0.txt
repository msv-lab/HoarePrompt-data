The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, where each test case involves two distinct non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\). It calculates the absolute difference \(k\) between \(n\) and \(m\), and based on certain conditions, prints one of the following values: \(k\), 1, 2, or \(k - q\), where \(q\) is derived from the binary representation of \(k\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
