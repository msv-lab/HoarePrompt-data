Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the modulus of `-num` divided by `x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the modulus of `-num` divided by `x` and assigns the result to `mod_x`. Since `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x` is determined by the value of `-num` and `x`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
