Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input().strip(' ')
    a = set()
    for i in s:
        a.add(i)
    if len(a) > 1:
        print('YES')
        newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
        isreverse = s[::-1]
        if newstr != s:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
        elif isreverse != s:
            print(isreverse)
        else:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is the last character of the original string `s` after all iterations, `s` is an empty string, `a` contains all unique characters from the original string `s`, and `newstr` is the reverse of the original string `s` if the length of set `a` is greater than 1; otherwise, `newstr` is the original string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is the last character in the string `s`, `s` is an empty string, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the original string `s`, and `newstr` is either an empty string or equal to `s`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is the first character in the string `s.strip()`, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s.strip()`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s.strip()` with the first half of `s.strip()`. If `newstr` is not equal to the original string `s.strip()`, then `newstr` remains unchanged. If `newstr` is equal to `s.strip()`, then `newstr` is set to the original string `s.strip()`. If the length of `a` is less than or equal to 1, `newstr` is either an empty string or equal to `s.strip()`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
