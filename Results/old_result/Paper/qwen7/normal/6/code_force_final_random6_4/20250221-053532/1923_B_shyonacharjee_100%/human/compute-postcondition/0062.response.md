Postcondition: `can_survive` remains False, `monsters` is a non-empty list without the first two tuples, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `health` is the health of the next monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the next monster. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
