Output State: **`t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are input strings from the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = input().split()` takes two space-separated inputs and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial conditions for `t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged except that now `a` and `b` are treated as strings.
