Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) for each given \( x \) (where \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \).
   - It prints \( y \).

3. **Key Consideration**:
   - The goal is to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \(\gcd(x, x-1) = 1\) because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers and thus coprime.
   - Therefore, \(\gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x\), which is the highest possible value for \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) since \(\gcd(x, y)\) can at most be 1.

4. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly sets \( y = x - 1 \) for each \( x \).
   - This ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y = x\), which is indeed the maximum possible value under the given constraints.

Based on this analysis, the code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
