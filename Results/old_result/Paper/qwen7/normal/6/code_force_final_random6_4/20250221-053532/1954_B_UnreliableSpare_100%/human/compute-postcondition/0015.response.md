Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`
   - `flag` remains False
   - If `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop condition is `i < n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` should be incremented to 3. Also, `n` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Consider Other States**: The other states (`arr[2]` not equal to `arr[1]`, `flag` remaining False) are not directly affected by the loop itself and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, and `flag` remains False**
