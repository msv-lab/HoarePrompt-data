Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is `n`, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `a`, `i`, `tmp`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
