Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `sz` will be an integer value that is at least `k` and no larger than `n-1`.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `sz` is less than `k`. For each iteration, if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` increases by 2. If `k - sz` is less than 2, `sz` does not change. Since the loop breaks when `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`, the final value of `sz` will be the smallest multiple of 2 that is at least `k` but does not exceed `n-1`.
