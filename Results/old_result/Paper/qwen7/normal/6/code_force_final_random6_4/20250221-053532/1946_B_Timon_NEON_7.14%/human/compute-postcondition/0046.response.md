Output State: **`segments_variants` is now a list containing `new_segment + [i_new - 1]`, `new_segment` is either `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or an empty list if `arr[i_new] < 0`, `max_segment` is now `new_segment`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is `i_new`.**

Explanation: The code `max_segment = new_segment` updates the value of `max_segment` to be the same as `new_segment`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
