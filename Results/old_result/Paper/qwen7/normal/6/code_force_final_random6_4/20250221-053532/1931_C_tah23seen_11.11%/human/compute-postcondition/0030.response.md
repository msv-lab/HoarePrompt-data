Output State: **`i` is 3 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, or `i` is 2 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `i` was initially 2, it becomes 3; if `i` was initially 1, it becomes 2. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The condition that `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]` still holds true.
