Output State: **counter is a value between 0 and the length of num (inclusive), and num is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 10^9\).**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `counter` will hold a value that represents how many trailing zeros ('0') there are in the string representation of `num`, starting from the end of the string. The value of `num` itself remains within the range of \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 10^9\). If `num` does not contain any trailing zeros, `counter` will be 0. If it contains trailing zeros, `counter` will be equal to the number of consecutive '0's from the end of the string representation of `num`.
