Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.
- It is not true that `a < b < c`.
- Either `a ≥ b` or `b ≤ c` holds.

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This code snippet simply prints the string `'NONE'`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not relevant to the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **NONE**
