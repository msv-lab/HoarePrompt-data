Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
