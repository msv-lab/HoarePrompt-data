Output State: **Postcondition: `k` must be greater than 0; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2; `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `k`, `mi`, `t`, and `ans` remain as they were in the initial state. Specifically, `k` must be greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, and `ans` remains unchanged.
