Output State: `max_sum` remains -1, `arr` remains a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment ending at the last index of `arr`, `max_segment` is a segment with its first element being the sum of the segment's elements and its second element being the end index of the segment, `segments_variants` is a list containing all possible segments that could be considered as `max_segment` during the loop execution, and `max_segment[0]` is the maximum sum found among all segments in `segments_variants`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `new_segment` will either be an empty list (if no positive segment was found) or a segment ending at the last index of `arr`. `max_segment` will be the segment with the highest sum found throughout the loop, and `segments_variants` will contain all potential segments that were candidates for `max_segment`. The value of `max_segment[0]` will be the highest sum among these segments.
