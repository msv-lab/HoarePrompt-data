The function processes a series of integers `t` and `n`. It first reads `t` test cases, each containing an integer `n`. For each test case, it initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, both of length equal to the maximum value in the input integers plus one, setting all elements to 0. It then populates the `values` list with the first 10 integers and calculates their cumulative sums in the `sum_values` list. Next, it updates the `values` and `sum_values` lists based on the last digit and the remaining part of each integer `n` in the input. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum corresponding to each integer `n` from the input. The function does not return any value but modifies the `values` and `sum_values` lists internally.
