Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is a list with its last element being `lit[3]`, `x` is infinity, `y` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 3, `lit[3]` is appended to `b`. Since the condition for `x` and `y` (whether `a` or `b` is empty) does not change with this operation, `x` remains infinity and `y` remains infinity. All other conditions remain unchanged.
