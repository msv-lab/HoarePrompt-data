Output State: **`ans` is 1 (or 0), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is 3 (or 1), `s` is 'map' or 'pie' (or neither 'map' nor 'pie'), `s` is now a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` slices the string `a` starting from index `i` (which is either 3 or 1) and takes a substring of length 3. This means `s` is now set to the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
