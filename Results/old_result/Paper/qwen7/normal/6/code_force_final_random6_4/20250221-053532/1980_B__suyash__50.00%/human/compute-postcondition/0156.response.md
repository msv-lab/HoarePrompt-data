Output State: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` by spaces and converting each part to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split(), `n` is the first element of list `b`, `f` is the second element of list `b`, `k` is the third element of list `b`, `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` of list `o`, `dic` is a dictionary where keys are elements of list `o` and values are their counts in list `o`.**

The code creates a dictionary `dic` where each key is an element from the list `o` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in the list `o`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
