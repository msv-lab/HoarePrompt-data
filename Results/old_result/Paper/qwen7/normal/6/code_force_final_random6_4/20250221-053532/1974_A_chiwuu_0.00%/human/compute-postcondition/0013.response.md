Output State: **`t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, and `b` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`. Since `t` can be either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `t1` will be `t * 15 - b * 4` in both cases. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
