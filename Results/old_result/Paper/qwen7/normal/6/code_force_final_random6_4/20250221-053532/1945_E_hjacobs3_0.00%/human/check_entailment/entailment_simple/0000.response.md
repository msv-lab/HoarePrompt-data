Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps to make the binary search algorithm work correctly, ensuring that \( p_l = x \) when the algorithm ends.
2. The provided code attempts to perform the necessary swaps but has some issues:
   - The initial values of `l` and `r` are set incorrectly. They should be initialized as `1` and `n + 1` respectively, not `0` and `-1`.
   - The logic inside the `func_1` function is flawed. It does not correctly identify the positions to swap to achieve the desired result.
   - The function does not handle the case where the element `x` is already in the correct position (`p_l`).
3. Let's correct these issues:
   - Initialize `l` to `1` and `r` to `n + 1`.
   - Identify the correct positions to swap based on the binary search logic.
   - Ensure the function returns the correct number of swaps and the swap positions.

Given the above analysis, the provided code is incorrect due to the initialization of `l` and `r` and the logic within the function.

Correctness: **False**
