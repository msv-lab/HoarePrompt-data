Output State: **All elements in `r` that correspond to indices `a[i] - 1` where `i` ranges from `n` to `2 * n - 1` have been set to 0. The value of `ur` is the total count of such elements that were set to 0, and no further changes to `ur` occur once it equals `ul`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
- For each iteration, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it prints `a[i] a[i]`, sets `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0, and increases `ur` by 2.
- If `ul` equals `ur` at any point, the loop breaks.
- After all iterations, all eligible elements in `r` corresponding to `a[i] - 1` within the specified range will have been set to 0.
- `ur` will hold the total count of these changes, and no further changes will occur if `ul` equals `ur`.
