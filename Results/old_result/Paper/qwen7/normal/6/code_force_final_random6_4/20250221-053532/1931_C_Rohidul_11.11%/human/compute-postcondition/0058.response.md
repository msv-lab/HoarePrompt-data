Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with the condition that consecutive elements in the list are equal until the end of the list is reached, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be true.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1. Initially, `r` was set to `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
