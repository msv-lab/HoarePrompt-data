Postcondition: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list using map and lambda, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. The current value of `a[l]` is 0.**
