Output State: **`ans` is 0 + (`zeroes` - `cnt[0]`), `cnt` is [0, 1], `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one element, `c` is the first element of `s`, and `c` is not 0.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its current value, which is 0. Therefore, `ans` becomes `zeroes - cnt[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
