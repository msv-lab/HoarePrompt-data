### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If yes, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
   - Otherwise, it counts the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The function `func_1()` checks if the array is uniform using a flag.
   - If the array is uniform, it directly prints `-1`.
   - If the array is not uniform, it iterates through the array to count the minimum number of removals needed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the uniform array correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, there is a flaw in the logic used to count the minimum number of removals. Specifically, the code only considers the minimum segment length where elements are the same but does not account for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing elements strategically.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The code correctly identifies uniform arrays and prints `-1`.
   - The logic to find the minimum removals is flawed. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The code would incorrectly identify the minimum segment length as 1 (the first '1'), but the correct answer should be 1 (removing the first '1' breaks the beauty condition).

### Example Counter-Case:
Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`:
- The code would output `1` because it finds the minimum segment length of consecutive `1`s as 1.
- However, the correct answer is `1` (removing the first '1' breaks the beauty condition).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem statement. The logic to count the minimum number of removals is flawed and does not account for the strategic removal of elements to break the beauty condition.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
