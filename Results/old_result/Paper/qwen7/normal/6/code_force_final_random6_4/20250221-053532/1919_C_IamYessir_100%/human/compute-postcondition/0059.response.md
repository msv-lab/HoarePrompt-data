Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the value of `lit[0]` with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` (which is `lit[0]` since `i` is 0) to the list `a`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
