Output State: **`s` is False, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` remains unchanged, `x` is equal to the final node `y` that was popped from `lst[x]` after the loop executed all its iterations, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to the variable `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
