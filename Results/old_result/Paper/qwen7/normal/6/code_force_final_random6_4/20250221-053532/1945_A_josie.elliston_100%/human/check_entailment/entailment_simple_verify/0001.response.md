### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants based on their preferences.
   - Each tent can hold up to 3 people.
   - Introverts need a tent alone, Extroverts need a tent with 2 others, and Universals can share a tent with anyone.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as input.
   - It checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0`. If true, it further checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`.
     - If this condition is true, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate these participants.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the constraints for extroverts and universals. However, there is a potential issue with the condition `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`. This condition should be `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` to ensure that there are enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts after forming complete groups of 3.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as input.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` (indicating impossibility).
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1`.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly uses the result from `func_1` and adds the introverts' requirements.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the constraints for extroverts and universals, but the condition `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` might be too restrictive.
   - For example, if `extroverts = 2` and `universals = 1`, `extroverts % 3 + universals = 2 + 1 = 3`, which should be sufficient, but the current condition would incorrectly return `None`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where it's impossible to accommodate the participants (e.g., when `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`), but the condition itself might be overly strict.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions almost correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required based on the given constraints. However, the condition `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` in `func_1` might be too restrictive and could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
