Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run for as many times as the user inputs an integer.

2. **Determine the initial state before the first iteration**: We need to consider the state at the end of the previous iteration to determine what needs to be adjusted for the next iteration. However, since this is the first iteration, we need to consider the initial state before the loop starts.

3. **Initial state before the loop starts**:
   - `end` is increased by 3 (but we don't know its initial value).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `l` is equal to `r - 3`, where `r` is the last index of the list `a`.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `end` will be increased by another 3.
   - `n` remains the same as it is an input integer.
   - `a` remains the same as it is derived from the input string.
   - `l` will be updated based on the new value of `r` (which changes with each iteration).

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `end` is increased by 3 in each iteration, after the first iteration, `end` will be increased by 6.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `l` will be updated to `r - 3`, where `r` is the last index of the list `a` after the first iteration.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `end` is increased by 6.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `l` is updated to `r - 3`, where `r` is the last index of the list `a` after the first iteration.

Since we don't have the exact value of `r` after the first iteration, we can represent it as `r` for now.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`end` is increased by 6, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 3`, where `r` is the last index of the list `a` after the first iteration.**
