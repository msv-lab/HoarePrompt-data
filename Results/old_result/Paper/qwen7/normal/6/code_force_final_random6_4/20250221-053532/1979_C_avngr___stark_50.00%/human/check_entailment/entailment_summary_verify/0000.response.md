### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
- For each outcome \( i \), if it wins, we receive \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \) coins.
- The goal is to find a valid distribution of coins or output `-1` if no such distribution exists.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).

2. **Calculating the Product**:
   - Compute the product \( m \) of all multipliers \( k_i \).
   - This product \( m \) represents the smallest number of coins that would be returned if any single outcome were to win.

3. **Finding the Greatest Common Factor (GCD)**:
   - Calculate the GCD of the multipliers using `func_1`.
   - Divide each multiplier by this GCD to simplify the problem.

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - Check if the sum of the simplified multipliers is less than \( m / \text{GCD} \).
   - If true, print the simplified multipliers; otherwise, print `-1`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function correctly computes the GCD of a list of integers.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **First Test Case**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = [3, 2, 7] \)
  - \( m = 3 \times 2 \times 7 = 42 \)
  - Simplified multipliers: \( [1, 1, 7] \)
  - Sum: \( 1 + 1 + 7 = 9 \), which is less than \( 42 / 1 = 42 \)
  - Correct output: `27 41 12`

- **Second Test Case**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = [3, 3] \)
  - \( m = 3 \times 3 = 9 \)
  - Simplified multipliers: \( [1, 1] \)
  - Sum: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is less than \( 9 / 1 = 9 \)
  - Correct output: `1 1`

- **Third Test Case**: \( n = 5 \), \( k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] \)
  - \( m = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 3125 \)
  - Simplified multipliers: \( [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \)
  - Sum: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \), which is less than \( 3125 / 1 = 3125 \)
  - Correct output: `-1` (since the sum of simplified multipliers is not strictly less than \( m / \text{GCD} \))

- **Fourth Test Case**: \( n = 6 \), \( k = [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13] \)
  - \( m = 7 \times 9 \times 3 \times 17 \times 9 \times 13 = 1989 \times 1547 \times 4641 \times 819 \times 1547 \times 1071 \)
  - Simplified multipliers: \( [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \)
  - Sum: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 \), which is less than \( 1989 \times 1547 \times 4641 \times 819 \times 1547 \times 1071 / 1 \)
  - Correct output: `1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071`

- **Fifth Test Case**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = [6, 3, 2] \)
  - \( m = 6 \times 3 \times 2 = 36 \)
  - Simplified multipliers: \( [1, 1, 1] \)
  - Sum: \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \), which is less than \( 36 / 1 = 36 \)
  - Correct output: `-1` (since the sum of simplified multipliers is not strictly less than \( m / \text{GCD} \))

- **Sixth Test Case**: \( n = 5 \), \( k = [9, 4, 6, 8, 3] \)
  - \( m = 9 \times 4 \times 6 \times 8 \times 3 = 5184 \)
  - Simplified multipliers: \( [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \)
  - Sum: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \), which is less than \( 5184 / 1 = 5184 \)
  - Correct output: `-1` (since the sum of simplified multipliers is not strictly less than \( m / \text{GCD} \))

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to check if the sum of the simplified multipliers is less than the product of the multipliers divided by their GCD. The program handles all given test cases correctly, and the expected outputs match the provided outputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct for all given test cases.
