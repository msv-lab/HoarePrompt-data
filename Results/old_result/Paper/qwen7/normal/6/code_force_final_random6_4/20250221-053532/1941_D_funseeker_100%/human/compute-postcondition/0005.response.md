Output State: **`r` is an integer value of the first element returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second element returned by `func_1().split()`, and `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The line `temp = set()` creates an empty set named `temp`. This does not affect the values of `r` and `c`, which remain as the first and second elements returned by `func_1().split()`, respectively.
