Postcondition: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and may have one more element added, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')`, and `y` is determined as follows: if `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, then `y` is the last element of list `a`; otherwise, if `b` is not empty, `y` is the last element of list `b`; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.**
