Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The precondition that `nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 remains valid, but since `nabors` is not used in the code, its value does not change. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now known integers from the input.
