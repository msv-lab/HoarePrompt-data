Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `rgt` is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the element `lft[0]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `sng` is an empty list, the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends `lft[i]` to `ldb`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `ldb` becomes a list containing the first element of `lft`, which is `lft[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
