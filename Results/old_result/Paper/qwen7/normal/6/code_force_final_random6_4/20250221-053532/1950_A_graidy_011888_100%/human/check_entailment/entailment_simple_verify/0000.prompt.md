You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `range(n)` and `n` can be up to 1000), `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split for the last iteration of the loop. If `a < b < c` during any iteration, 'STAIR' is printed; if `a < b` and `b > c`, 'PEAK' is printed; otherwise, 'NONE' is printed. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change within the loop unless explicitly modified in the else block, but since no such modification is specified, they retain their input values from the last iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `t` remains between 1 and 1000, `i` will be 999 (if `n` is set to its maximum value of 1000), and `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values entered in the last input of the loop. The printed output will be 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions met during the iterations, with `a`, `b`, and `c` retaining their last input values.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal. According to the problem description, if `a == b == c`, the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. For example, if the input is `4 4 4`, the program will output "PEAK" instead of "NONE".
