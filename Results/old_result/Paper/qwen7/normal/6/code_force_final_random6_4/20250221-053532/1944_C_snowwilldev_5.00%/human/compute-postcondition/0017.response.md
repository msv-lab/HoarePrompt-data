Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `N` is an integer such that `i` remains within the range `[0, N-1]` during the loop execution, and the current value of `cnt[i]` is equal to 1; `t` is 1.**

The code `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was previously not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it was 0. After executing the code, `t` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
