Output State: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` is less than `r`, and `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[l]`. Since `mi` is defined as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `l` is less than `r`, the value of `a[l]` is updated to be `a[l] - mi`. The conditions that `l` must be less than `r` and `k` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged.
