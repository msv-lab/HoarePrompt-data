Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, `d` is an integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the next input split, `f` is the second integer from the next input split, `g` is the first integer from the current input split, `h` is the second integer from the current input split, `x` is \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\), `n` is \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), `n` is \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to be \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), which is equivalent to \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\). All other variables remain unchanged.
