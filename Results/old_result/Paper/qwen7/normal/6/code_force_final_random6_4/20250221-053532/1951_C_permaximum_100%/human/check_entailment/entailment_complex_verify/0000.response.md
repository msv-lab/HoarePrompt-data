### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values and passes them to the `func_1` function.
2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue with tuples containing the price and index of each day.
3. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a heap to efficiently get the day with the lowest price.
4. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program buys tickets in a way that considers the price increase after each purchase.
5. **Edge Cases**: The original assessment mentions that the program does not handle the case where `k` exceeds `m * n`. Let's verify if this is indeed a problem.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a priority queue with the prices and indices of the days.
   - This ensures that the day with the lowest price is always considered first.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The program iterates until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - For each iteration, it pops the day with the lowest price from the priority queue.
   - It calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`) and updates the total cost accordingly.
   - The price increase is added to the total cost for the next iterations.

3. **Price Increase**:
   - The price increase is correctly applied to the next day's prices.
   - This ensures that the price of tickets bought later is higher due to the previous purchases.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not explicitly check if `k` exceeds `m * n`.
   - However, the logic of the program inherently handles this case by distributing tickets across the days as much as possible.
   - If `k` exceeds `m * n`, the program will still try to buy as many tickets as possible within the constraints of `m` tickets per day.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly distributes tickets across the days to minimize the total cost.
   - It ensures that the price increase is applied correctly and that the tickets are bought in a way that minimizes the overall cost.

Given the analysis, the program correctly handles the distribution of tickets and the price increases. The original assessment is incorrect in stating that the program fails to handle the case where `k` exceeds `m * n`. The program's logic ensures that tickets are distributed optimally across the days, even if `k` exceeds `m * n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and handles the given problem description accurately.
