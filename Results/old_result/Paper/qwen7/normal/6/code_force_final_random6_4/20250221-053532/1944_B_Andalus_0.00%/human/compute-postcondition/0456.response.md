Output State: All elements in `sng` have been processed, `sz` is equal to the length of `sng`, and `rdb` remains empty.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `sz` is less than `k`. Since the loop breaks when `sz` is no longer less than `k`, all elements in `sng` will be printed and `sz` will be equal to the length of `sng`. The initial conditions state that `rdb` is empty, and this does not change within the loop, so `rdb` remains empty.
