Based on the initial state provided:

- `fav` is an integer.
- `i` is `i_end + 1`.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i_end + 1]]` if `fav` is equal to `l[i_end + 1]`, otherwise `k` is decreased by the value at index `i_end + 1` of list `l`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`. This means it will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
