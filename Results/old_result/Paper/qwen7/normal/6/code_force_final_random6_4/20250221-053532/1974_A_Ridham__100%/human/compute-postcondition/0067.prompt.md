You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the input integer provided at the start. After all iterations, `result` will be a list containing the number of elements that satisfy the conditions specified within the loop. Each element in the list represents the value of `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions met during each iteration.
    #
    #- `remaining_cells` will be recalculated for each iteration based on the current values of `y` and `space_y`.
    #- `space_x` will remain constant as it is initialized to `x * 1` and does not change throughout the loop.
    #- `space_y` will be updated to `y * 4` for each new iteration.
    #- `total_space` will be the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`.
    #- `t` and `n` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.
    #- `x` and `y` will be updated with new input values for each iteration.
    #- `screen_require_for_y` will be either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` based on whether `y` is even or odd.
    #- `extra_space` will be `space_x - remaining_cells`.
    #- `extra_screen` will be calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`, or `extra_space // 15` otherwise.
    #
    #The final `result` list will contain the outcomes of each iteration, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, depending on the conditions evaluated in the loop.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: the outcome of each iteration (either screen_require_for_y or extra_screen + screen_require_for_y) on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each `t`, it processes pairs of integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. The function does not return a specific value but processes these inputs according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
