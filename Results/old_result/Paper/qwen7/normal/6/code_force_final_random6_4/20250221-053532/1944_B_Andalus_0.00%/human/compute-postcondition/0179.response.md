Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`; `sng` is a list that includes an additional element `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is different from `lft[i + 1]`. If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` will have `lft[i]` added to it. If the condition `i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]` is false, `sng` remains unchanged.
