Output State: **`first` is True, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and `n` is assigned the value of int(input()).**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables (`first`, `i`, `arr`, and `mpp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
