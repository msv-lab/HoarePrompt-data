You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`; `a` will be a list where each element `a[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) will be equal to the initial value of `a[j]` plus `j+1`.
    #
    #This means that if the loop runs `n` times, the final value of `a[j]` for any valid index `j` will be the initial value of `a[j]` increased by `j + 1`. The variable `n` itself will retain its initial value, and `i` will be set to `n - 1` after the last iteration.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in `i` being equal to `len(a)`, `ans` containing all the elements as specified by the loop's logic, `cnt` being reduced to `0`, and `counter` having decremented the count of each element in `a` by the number of times it was appended to `ans`.
    #
    #To break it down:
    #- `i` will be `len(a)` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of the list `a`.
    #- `ans` will contain all the elements generated according to the loop's logic, which involves decrementing the count of each element in `a` and appending the appropriate values to `ans`.
    #- `cnt` will be `0` since it is decremented by `adv` each time in the loop, and `adv` is always less than or equal to `cnt`.
    #- `counter` will reflect the final counts of each element in `a` after all elements have been processed and their counts decremented accordingly.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in `i` being equal to `len(a)`, `ans` containing a sequence of decremented values starting from the initial last element of `a` and decreasing by 1 for each iteration, `cnt` being reduced to `0`, and `counter` having decremented the count of each element in `a` by the number of times it was appended to `ans`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
    #- `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`.
    #- `ans` will be a list where the initial last element of `a` is repeatedly decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
    #- `cnt` will be `0` since it is decremented with each iteration and cannot go below zero.
    #- `counter` will show the final counts of each element in `a` after all elements have been processed and their counts decremented according to the loop's logic.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: last_element_of_a last_element_of_a - 1 last_element_of_a - 2 ... 1 0 (where last_element_of_a is the last element of the list `a`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a list of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of t, n, and the list a.
