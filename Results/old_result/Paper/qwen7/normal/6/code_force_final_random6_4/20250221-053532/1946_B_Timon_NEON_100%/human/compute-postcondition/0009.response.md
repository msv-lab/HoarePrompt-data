Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is not empty, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is now containing `[0, 0, -1]`, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code appends the list `max_segment + [i - 1]` to `segments_variants`. Given that `i` is 0, `i - 1` evaluates to -1. So, `max_segment + [i - 1]` becomes `[0, 0, -1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
