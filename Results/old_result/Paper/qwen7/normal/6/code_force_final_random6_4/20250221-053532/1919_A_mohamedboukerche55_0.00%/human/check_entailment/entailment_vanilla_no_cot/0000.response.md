Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. According to the game rules and the provided examples, the key observation is that the player whose turn it is when the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even will lose if both players play optimally. This is because the player can always force the opponent into a position where the total number of coins is odd, and eventually, the opponent will be left with no valid moves when the total number of coins becomes zero.

However, the given program simply checks if `(a + b)` is even and prints 'bob' if true, and 'alice' otherwise. This is incorrect because the correct logic should be:

- If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, then the player whose turn it is (starting with Alice) will lose, so the other player (Bob) wins.
- If `(a + b) % 2 != 0`, then the player whose turn it is (starting with Alice) will win.

Therefore, the correct implementation should check the parity of `(a + b)` and determine the winner based on whose turn it is. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This corrected version correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins and the turn order.
