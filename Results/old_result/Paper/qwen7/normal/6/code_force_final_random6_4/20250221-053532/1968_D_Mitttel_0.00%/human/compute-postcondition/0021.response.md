Output State: **`index` is \(18 + n + n\), `PB` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` must be greater than 0 (integer value from `data[0]`), `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `PS` is an integer value from `data[8]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `PB` to be the integer value from `data[index + 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `index` is still \(18 + n + n\), and the values of `PB`, `k`, `n`, `t`, `results`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are updated according to their respective definitions in the initial state.
