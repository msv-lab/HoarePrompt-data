#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing the initial and desired states of the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        a1 = s1.count('1')
        
        a2 = s2.count('1')
        
        hd = a1 - a2
        
        res = abs(a1 - a2)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if hd > 0:
                hd -= 1
                continue
            if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `t`, `hd` will be `a1 - a2 - t`, `n` will be 0, `res` will be the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + t`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, and `t` is the initial input integer specifying the number of iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will reflect the total number of iterations, which is `t`. The variable `hd` will be the difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2` minus the total number of iterations, `t`. The variable `n` will be 0 because it is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. The variable `res` will hold the absolute value of the initial difference between the counts of '1's in `s1` and `s2` plus the total number of iterations, `t`. The counts of '1's in `s1` and `s2` are stored in `a1` and `a2`, respectively, and `t` remains unchanged as it was the initial input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \), a positive integer \( n \), and two binary strings \( s \) and \( f \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state \( s \) into the desired state \( f \). The function returns the total number of operations needed across all test cases.
