Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `index` is \(18 + n + n\)
   - `PB` is an integer value from `data[5]`
   - `k` is an integer value from `data[2]`
   - `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`
   - `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`
   - `PS` is an integer value from `data[8]`
   - `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `t > 0`. Since `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, we need to check its value to determine if the loop should continue.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. If `t` is greater than 0, then it will be decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Given that `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

**State at the start of the next iteration:**
- `index` remains the same: \(18 + n + n\)
- `PB` remains the same: integer value from `data[5]`
- `k` remains the same: integer value from `data[2]`
- `n` remains the same: integer value from `data[1]`
- `t` must be greater than 0: integer value from `data[0]` (decremented by 1 if it was greater than 0)
- `results` remains the same: list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`
- `PS` remains the same: integer value from `data[8]`
- `p` remains the same: list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`
- `a` remains the same: list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`index` is \(18 + n + n\), `PB` is an integer value from `data[5]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` must be greater than 0 (integer value from `data[0]`), `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `PS` is an integer value from `data[8]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers**.
