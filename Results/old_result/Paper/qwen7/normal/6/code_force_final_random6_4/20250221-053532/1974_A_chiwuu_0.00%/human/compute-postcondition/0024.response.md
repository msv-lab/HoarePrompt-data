Output State: **`t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. The values of `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The condition that `t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1` is still valid, but since `t` has changed, `t1` would now be recalculated based on the new value of `t`. However, the exact value of `t1` is not specified, so we only state that it is less than `a` and related to `t2`.
