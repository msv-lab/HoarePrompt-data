Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` is 0, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is 0, `sm` is sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - 0 + 1).**

Explanation: The code updates `over_sum` to be equal to `sm`. Since `sm` was previously defined as `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - 0 + 1)`, `over_sum` now holds the same value as `sm`. All other variables (`r`, `l`, `i`, and `sm`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
