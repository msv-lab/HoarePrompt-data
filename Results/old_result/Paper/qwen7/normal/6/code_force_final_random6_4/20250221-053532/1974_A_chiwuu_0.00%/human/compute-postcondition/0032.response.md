Output State: **`t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer. The values of `t1`, `n`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged. The variable `a` now holds an integer value, which was previously a string.
