Output State: **`ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is the last element of `ans` (which is `ans[-1]`) decreased by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values in the list, we only know that the last element of `ans` has been decreased by 1. All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged.
