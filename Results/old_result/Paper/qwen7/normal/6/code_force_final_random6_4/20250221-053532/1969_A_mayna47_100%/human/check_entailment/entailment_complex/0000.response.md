Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using the function `func_1()`.
- For each test case, the function `func_1()`:
  - Reads the number of friends `n`.
  - Initializes a list `v` with zeros, and updates it with the input values.
  - Checks if there exists any index `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. If such an index is found, it means there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and thus, sending invitations to both of them ensures at least 2 friends come to the party. In this case, it prints `2` and returns.
  - If no such index is found, it prints `3` and returns. This implies that the only way to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is to invite all friends individually, which is not optimal but necessary when no self-referential pairs exist.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case. The function handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
