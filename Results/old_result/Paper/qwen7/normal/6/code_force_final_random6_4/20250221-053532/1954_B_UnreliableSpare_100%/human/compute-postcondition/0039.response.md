Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, starting from an initial state where `i` is `i + 1` and `n` must be greater than 1. Since `cnt` was not specified with an initial value, it is assumed to start at 0. After executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` becomes 1. The conditions on `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
