Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `q` (which is iterated over `ans`), and implicitly `ans` itself.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `q` and `ans`**:
   - `ans` is defined as `(q - r) % n`.
   - `q` is the variable being iterated over `ans`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. If `ans` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - Since `q` is iterated over `ans`, `q` will take on each value in `ans` during each iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `ans` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The initial state of `q` will be the first element in `ans`.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `ans` is not empty and `q` is initialized to the first element in `ans`.

**State:**
- `ans` must not be an empty set.
- `q` must be the first element in `ans`.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`ans` is not an empty set, `q` is the first element in `ans`, `temp` is an empty set, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()`**
