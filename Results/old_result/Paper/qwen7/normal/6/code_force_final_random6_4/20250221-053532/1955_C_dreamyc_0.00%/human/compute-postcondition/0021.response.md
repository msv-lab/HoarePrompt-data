Postcondition: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-1 integers (excluding the first and last elements). If `a > 0`, then `nums` is updated to append the value of `a` to the left end of the deque, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x` and both `a` and `b` are updated to `a - x` and `b - x` respectively, where `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1, and no changes are made to `k`, `a`, `b`, or `nums`.**
