Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
            suma += x
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                suma += 1
    print(suma - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the final value after the loop completes, `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated within the loop plus additional increments based on the specified conditions.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains 0 as it was not modified inside the loop. The variable `a` retains its initial value since it is not changed within the loop. The variable `b` will be set to the highest value of `i` used in the loop, which is `b + 1` where `b` is the original value passed into the loop. The variable `suma` accumulates the value of `x` for each iteration of the loop, adding 1 to `suma` if the specific condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is met for any `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is 1, a is `int(info[0])`, b is `int(info[1])`, i is `b + 1`, x is undefined, and suma is the sum calculated over all iterations of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the final value it reached after the loop, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `suma` is the sum of all `x` values that satisfy the conditions within the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains 2, `a` retains its initial value, `b` is the highest value it reached during the loop's execution, `i` is one more than the final value of `b`, `x` is calculated based on the last iteration's values, and `suma` is the cumulative sum of all valid `x` values that met the specified conditions throughout the loop's iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
