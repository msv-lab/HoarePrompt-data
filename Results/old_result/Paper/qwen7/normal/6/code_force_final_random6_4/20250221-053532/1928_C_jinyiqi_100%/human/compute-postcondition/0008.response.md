Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
   - `output1` is a list containing `[1]`.
   - `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 2)]` if `x % i == 0`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making it `i = 3`.

5. **Checking the New State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `n`.

6. **Final Adjusted States**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` remains the same (still an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\)).
   - `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to these lists within the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing `[1]`, and `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 2)]` if `x % 3 == 0`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.**
