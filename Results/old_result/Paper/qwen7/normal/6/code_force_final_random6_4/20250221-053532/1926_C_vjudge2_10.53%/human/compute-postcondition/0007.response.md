Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the last element is `n`.**

Explanation: The code `numbers.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `numbers`. Since `numbers` initially contained `n` elements, after appending `n`, it now contains `n+1` elements, with the last element being `n`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
