Postcondition: **`cd` is updated based on the count of consecutive pairs of elements in `nums` that differ by exactly 1`, `i` is the index just beyond the last pair of consecutive elements that differ by exactly 1, or `len(nums) - 2` if such pairs exist throughout the list, `nums` remains unchanged from the initial state, and `(cd & 1)` is False**
