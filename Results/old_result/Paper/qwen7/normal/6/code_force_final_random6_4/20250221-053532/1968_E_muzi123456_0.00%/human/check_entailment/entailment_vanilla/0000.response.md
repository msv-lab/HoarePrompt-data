Reasoning:
1. Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem.
2. The program defines a function `func()` which reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
4. Then, for each `i` from 1 to `n`, it prints the coordinates `(1, i)`.
5. After printing all coordinates for the current test case, it prints a newline character.

Now let's evaluate if this program satisfies the problem requirements:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
- For each test case, it prints `n` points in the format `(1, i)` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. This means all points lie on the same vertical line (x-coordinate is always 1).
- The Manhattan distance between any two points `(1, i)` and `(1, j)` is `|i - j|`, which covers all values from `0` to `n-1`.

Given these observations, the program does indeed maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) because it ensures that all possible Manhattan distances between any two points are covered, which are exactly the integers from `0` to `n-1`.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
