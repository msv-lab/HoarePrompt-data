Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is less than 200 or exactly 200, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `s`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
