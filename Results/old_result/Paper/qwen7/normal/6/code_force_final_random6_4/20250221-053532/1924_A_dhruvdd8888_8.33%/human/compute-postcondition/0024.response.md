Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, the variable `i` is the only variable in the loop head.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `ans`, `win`, `ps`) are not affected by the loop itself and remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given that `i` is the second character of the string `s` at the end of the previous iteration, the next character `i` will be the third character of the string `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is the third character of the string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing the element `i`, `win` is a set that contains `i` if `i` is in the set `us`, and `ps` is 1 if `i` is in `us`, otherwise `ps` remains 0.**
