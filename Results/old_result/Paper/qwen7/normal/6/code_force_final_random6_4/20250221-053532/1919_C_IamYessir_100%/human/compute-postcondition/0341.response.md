Postcondition: `i` is 2, `b` is a list with at least one element, and `s` is 2. If `b[2]` is greater than `b[1]`, then the postcondition remains as `i` is 2, `b` is a list with at least one element, and `s` is 2. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition.
