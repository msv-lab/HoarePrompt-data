Reasoning:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Initial Calculation of Screens**: The variable `t` is initially set to `b * 2`. This calculation assumes that each 2x2 icon requires 2 screens (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are 5 cells per row, thus 2 full rows are needed). However, this is incorrect because each 2x2 icon actually occupies 5 cells (2 rows and 2 columns), so it should be `t = b * 5`.

2. **Adjustment for Remaining Cells**: The code then tries to adjust `t` based on the remaining 1x1 icons (`a`). The logic here is flawed:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is an attempt to calculate the remaining capacity of the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not properly account for the actual capacity of the screens.
   - The subsequent checks and adjustments do not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons into the remaining space.

3. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
   - Calculate the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
   - Determine the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - Place the 1x1 icons into the remaining space.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b * 4 + 4) // 5
        
        # Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = (screens_for_2x2 * 15) - (b * 4)
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (a + remaining_space - 1) // 15
        
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        
        print(total_screens)
```

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
