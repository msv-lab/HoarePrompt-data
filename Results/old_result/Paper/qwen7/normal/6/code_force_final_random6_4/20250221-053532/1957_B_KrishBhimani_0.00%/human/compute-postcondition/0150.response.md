Output State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is 1, `ans` contains [0, -1], and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
