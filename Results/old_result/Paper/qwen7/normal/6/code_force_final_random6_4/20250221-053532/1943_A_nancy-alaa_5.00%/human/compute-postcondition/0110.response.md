Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and the current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
