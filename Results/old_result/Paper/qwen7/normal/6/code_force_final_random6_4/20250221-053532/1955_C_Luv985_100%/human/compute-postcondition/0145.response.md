Output State: **`k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`; `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`; `ans` is incremented by 1 (so `ans` is now `ans + 1`), and `l` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0; otherwise, the values remain unchanged.**

This means that `ans` has been incremented by 1, making it `ans + 1`. If `a[l]` was 0 before the increment, `l` would now be incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain as per the initial postcondition.
