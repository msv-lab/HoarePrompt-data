Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, or `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and the loop has terminated because `i` is no longer less than or equal to `j`.
    #
    #To explain this in natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `i` and `j` will be such that `i` is 1 and `j` is the second last index of `arr`, or `i` is 0 and `j` is the last index of `arr`. The loop terminates when `i` exceeds `j`, meaning all elements in the array have been compared in pairs from the start and end moving towards the center.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, or `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and the loop has not terminated because `i` is still less than or equal to `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is the length of `arr` - 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be one less than the length of `arr`, and `j` will be `i - 1`. Additionally, every element from `arr[i]` to the end of the array must be equal, as the loop continues to increment `i` as long as `arr[i]` equals `arr[i + 1]`.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between index j and i plus one, which is the distance between two consecutive elements in the list `arr` that are equal.
    #State: `i` is the length of `arr` - 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Additionally, `j` is equal to the length of `arr` - 1
    return j - i
    #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns either 0, the difference between the indices of two consecutive equal elements plus one, or 1. It first checks if any two consecutive elements in the list are equal by comparing elements from both ends of the list towards the center. If no such elements are found, it returns 0. If two consecutive equal elements are found, it returns the distance between them. If no such elements are found after the initial check, it returns 1.
