Postcondition: `d` is `n - 3`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, `path` now includes the value of `v` appended, and if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `path` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
