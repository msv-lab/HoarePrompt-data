Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ticket Purchasing Strategy**: The solution assumes that buying tickets in large batches (up to `m` tickets per day) is always beneficial, but it doesn't consider the optimal strategy where buying smaller batches might be better to avoid unnecessary price increases.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The logic for calculating the cost when `k` is not a multiple of `m` is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `mu` and its use in the cost formula do not correctly account for the price increase mechanism.

3. **Sorting the Prices**: Sorting the prices array (`M`) before processing might not always yield the optimal solution. The optimal strategy involves considering the price increases after each purchase, which sorting alone does not address.

4. **Edge Cases Not Considered**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is less than or equal to the number of days (`n`), or when the maximum tickets that can be bought per day (`m`) is small compared to `k`.

To correctly solve this problem, a more dynamic programming approach would be necessary, considering the price increases after each purchase and finding the minimum cost through an optimal strategy that takes into account the constraints and the price changes.
