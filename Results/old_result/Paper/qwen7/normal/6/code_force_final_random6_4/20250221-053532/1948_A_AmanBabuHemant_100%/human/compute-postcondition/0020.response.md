Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is less than 200 or exactly 200.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t` and `s` remain unchanged, and the relationship between `s` and `n` is updated to reflect the new value of `n`. The length of `s` is still constrained to be less than 200 or exactly 200, as per the initial state.
