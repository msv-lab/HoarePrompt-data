Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.

The `print('Bob')` statement simply outputs the string 'Bob'. The values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are not relevant to this particular print statement since it does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **Bob**
