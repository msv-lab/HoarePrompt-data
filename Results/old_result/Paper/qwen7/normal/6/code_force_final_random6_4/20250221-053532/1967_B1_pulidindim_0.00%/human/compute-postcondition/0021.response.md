Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (n / 3 - 0) / 3 + 1`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n / 3`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `g` is less than `countmins`.
