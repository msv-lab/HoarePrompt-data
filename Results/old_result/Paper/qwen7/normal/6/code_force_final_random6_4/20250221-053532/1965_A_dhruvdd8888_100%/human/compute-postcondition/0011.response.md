Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ls` is the original value of `ls` plus `nums[1]`.
   - `nums[1]` is decreased by `ls`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(nums)`. Hence, `i` should be 2.
   - The value of `ls` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - The value of `nums[1]` is already adjusted, so no further change is needed for this specific variable.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `ls` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `nums[1]` is already adjusted and does not need further modification.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `ls` is the original value of `ls` plus `nums[1]`, `nums[1]` is decreased by `ls`**
