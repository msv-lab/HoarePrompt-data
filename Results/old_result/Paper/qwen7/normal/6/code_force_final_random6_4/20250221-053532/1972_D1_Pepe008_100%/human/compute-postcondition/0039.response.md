Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `suma` is 0, `info` is a list of strings split from the input**.

Explanation: The line `suma = 0` initializes the variable `suma` to 0. This sets the value of `suma` directly to 0 without affecting the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `info`. Therefore, the initial values of these variables remain unchanged except for `suma`, which is now explicitly set to 0.
