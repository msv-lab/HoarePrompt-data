Postcondition: **The stack contains tuples where each tuple consists of a vertex from `tree.vertices[v].children` and a boolean value indicating whether the child has been processed (`True`) or not (`False`). Specifically, the stack will include every vertex that can be reached from `v` via its children and their children, and so on, with each vertex's processing status recorded.**
