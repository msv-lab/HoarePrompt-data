Postcondition: `fnd` is 1 if `tot` (sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` is 0, `in_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` starting from index `m` to the end, `out_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` from the beginning to `n - m`, and the elements in `D[out_aa]` are all less than or equal to 0
