Output State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes three variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
