Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9], `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment with its start point increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment with its first element increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]` and `max_segment` remains `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `segments_variants` remains an empty list if `new_segment` is empty, and the current value of `i` is equal to the length of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i]` is less than 0, otherwise it is `[arr[i], i]`, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty, otherwise it is `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, otherwise it is an empty list, and the current value of `i` is decremented by 1 if `new_segment` is not empty, otherwise it remains the length of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `new_segment` and `max_segment` are lists. If `arr[i] < 0` and `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` and `new_segment` is not empty, then `new_segment` becomes an empty list, `max_segment` becomes `max_segment + [i - 1]`, and `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] < 0` and `max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0]` or `new_segment` is empty, then `new_segment` remains unchanged, `max_segment` becomes `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `new_segment` becomes an empty list, and `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] >= 0`, then `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, and `new_segment` is now `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, `new_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
