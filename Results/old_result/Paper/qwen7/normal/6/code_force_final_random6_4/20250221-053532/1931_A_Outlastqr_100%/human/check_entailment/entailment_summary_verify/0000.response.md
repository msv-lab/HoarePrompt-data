### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary against the problem description and the expected outputs.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that encodes to a given integer `n`.
- The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).
- The output should be the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that encodes to `n`.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- It constructs and prints a specific string `word` based on the value of `n`.
- The function does not return any value but prints the constructed string for each test case.

#### Test Case Analysis:
1. **Input: 24**
   - Expected Output: `aav`
   - Explanation: 24 = 3 + 1 + 20, so the word is "cat". The lexicographically smallest word is "aav".
2. **Input: 70**
   - Expected Output: `rzz`
   - Explanation: 70 = 18 + 26 + 26, so the word is "rzz".
3. **Input: 3**
   - Expected Output: `aaa`
   - Explanation: 3 = 1 + 1 + 1, so the word is "aaa".
4. **Input: 55**
   - Expected Output: `czz`
   - Explanation: 55 = 3 + 26 + 26, so the word is "czz".
5. **Input: 48**
   - Expected Output: `auz`
   - Explanation: 48 = 1 + 21 + 26, so the word is "auz".

#### Detailed Code Analysis:
1. **Case `n > 52`:**
   - `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`
   - This handles cases where the sum is greater than 52, ensuring the third letter is 'z' and the second letter is the largest possible.

2. **Case `n > 27`:**
   - `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`
   - This handles cases where the sum is between 28 and 52, ensuring the first and third letters are 'a' and 'z', respectively, and the second letter is the largest possible.

3. **Case `n == 27`:**
   - `word = 'aay'`
   - This handles the specific case where the sum is exactly 27, ensuring the word is "aay".

4. **Case `n <= 27`:**
   - `word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`
   - This handles cases where the sum is less than or equal to 27, ensuring the first two letters are 'a' and the third letter is the smallest possible.

#### Verification:
- The provided program correctly handles all cases and produces the expected outputs for the given examples.
- The logic ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect. The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for each test case.

**Final: True**
