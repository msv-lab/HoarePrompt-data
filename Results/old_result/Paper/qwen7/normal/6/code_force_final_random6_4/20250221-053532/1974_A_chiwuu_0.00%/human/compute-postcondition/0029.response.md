To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t1` remains unchanged and `t` is updated according to the specified rules.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, `t1` is set to `a - t1`, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t` is updated based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15 or not.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The value of `t1` depends on the value of `t`, which itself depends on `b`.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` is updated based on the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, `t1` is adjusted to `a - t1`, and then `t` is updated based on the divisibility of `a - t1` by 15.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the possible values of `t1` and how `t` is updated:

- Since `t1` is derived from `t` and `b`, and `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, we need to consider both cases.
- Let's assume a specific value for `b` to illustrate the process. For simplicity, let's take `b = 5`.

If `b = 5`:
- `t` can be `5 * 2 // 5 = 2` or `5 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 3`.

Let's calculate `t1` for both cases:
- If `t = 2`, then `t1 = 2 * 15 - 5 * 4 = 30 - 20 = 10`.
- If `t = 3`, then `t1 = 3 * 15 - 5 * 4 = 45 - 20 = 25`.

Now, let's consider the update rules:
- If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t1` remains unchanged.
- If `t1` is less than `a`, `t1` is set to `a - t1`, and `t2` is `a - t1`.

Assume `a = 20` for illustration:
- If `t1 = 10`, since `10 < 20`, `t1` is set to `20 - 10 = 10`, and `t2` is also `10`.
- If `t1 = 25`, since `25 >= 20`, `t1` remains `25`.

In both cases, the final value of `t` is derived from the updated `t1` or `t2` based on the divisibility by 15. However, the exact value of `t` is not explicitly provided in the problem statement, so we focus on the value that will be printed.

Given the conditions and the calculations, the value of `t` after the updates will be derived from the final `t1` or `t2` value, but the exact value is not specified in the problem.

Output: **t (where t is the value derived from the final t1 or t2 after the updates)**
