Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is known but its exact value is not specified, `sng` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[0]`, `rgt` retains its state after the last iteration with the current value of `rgt[1]` being equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` retains its state after the last iteration, `sz` retains its state after the last iteration, `k` retains its state after the last iteration, `lst` retains its state after the last iteration, `lft` retains its state after the last iteration.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rgt[i]` (which is `rgt[0]` since `i` is 1) to the list `rdb`. Therefore, `rdb` now contains the value of `rgt[0]`. All other variables retain their state from the initial condition.
