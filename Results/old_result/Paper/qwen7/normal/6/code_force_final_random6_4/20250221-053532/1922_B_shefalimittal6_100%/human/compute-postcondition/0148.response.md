Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is `idx - 1`
   - `cnt` is `v[0] + v[2]`
   - `ans` is increased by either `cnt * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2` if `v[2] < 3`, or `v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6` if `v[2] >= 3`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` from the previous value.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration, which is `idx - 1`.

5. **State the updated values**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` will be `idx - 1`.
   - `cnt`, `ans`, and `v` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `idx - 1`, `cnt` is `v[0] + v[2]`, and `ans` is increased by either `cnt * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2` if `v[2] < 3`, or `v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6` if `v[2] >= 3`.**
