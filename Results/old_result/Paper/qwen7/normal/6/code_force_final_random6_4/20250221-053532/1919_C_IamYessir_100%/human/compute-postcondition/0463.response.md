Output State: **`i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[3]`; `b` is a list (possibly empty); `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is non-empty, otherwise `y` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3, `a` becomes a non-empty list with its last element being `lit[3]`. The conditions regarding `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from the initial state since no operations affecting them were performed.
