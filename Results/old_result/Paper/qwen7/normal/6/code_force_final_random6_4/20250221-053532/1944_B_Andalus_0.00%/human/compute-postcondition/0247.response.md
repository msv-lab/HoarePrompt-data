Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 3.
- `sng` is a non-empty iterable.
- `elem` is the second element of `sng`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

Since `sng` is a non-empty iterable, it must contain at least one element. Let's denote the elements of `sng` as `[e1, e2, ...]`. According to the initial state, `elem` is the second element of `sng`, so `elem = e2`.

The print statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Therefore, the output will be the second element of `sng`.

Output: **e2 (the second element of sng)**
