### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the given code using the provided function summary and the detailed rules of the game.

1. **Understanding the Game Rules**:
   - Each player takes turns.
   - A player can either swap wallets or keep them.
   - After each turn, a player removes one coin from their wallet (if possible).
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Analyzing the Given Conditions**:
   - If `a == b`, the game is symmetric, and the player whose turn it is will lose because they will be forced to make a move that results in both having zero coins.
   - If `a == 1`, Alice can remove the last coin and force Bob to lose.
   - If `b == 1`, Bob can remove the last coin and force Alice to lose.
   - If `a` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by removing the last coin and swapping back.
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by removing the last coin and swapping back.
   - If `a > b`, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by removing the last coin and swapping back.
   - Otherwise, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by removing the last coin and swapping back.

3. **Checking the Code Logic**:
   - The code correctly handles the conditions where `a == b`, `a == 1`, `b == 1`, and `a` is odd.
   - However, the logic for `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` does not cover all scenarios correctly. Specifically, if `a` is even and `b` is odd, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by removing the last coin and swapping back.
   - The condition `a > b` should be handled more carefully to ensure that Bob can always force Alice into a losing position, which is not fully covered by the current logic.

Let's break down the conditions again:

- **Case 1**: `a == b`
  - Both players have the same number of coins, and since the game is symmetric, the player whose turn it is will lose.
  - Correctly handled by the code.

- **Case 2**: `a == 1`
  - Alice can remove the last coin and force Bob to lose.
  - Correctly handled by the code.

- **Case 3**: `b == 1`
  - Bob can remove the last coin and force Alice to lose.
  - Correctly handled by the code.

- **Case 4**: `a` is odd
  - Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by removing the last coin and swapping back.
  - Correctly handled by the code.

- **Case 5**: `a` is even and `b` is odd
  - Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by removing the last coin and swapping back.
  - The code incorrectly prints "Alice" in this case.

- **Case 6**: `a > b`
  - Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by removing the last coin and swapping back.
  - The code incorrectly handles this case.

- **Other Cases**: 
  - The remaining cases should be handled such that Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by removing the last coin and swapping back.
  - The code incorrectly handles these cases as well.

Given the analysis, the code does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly the conditions where `a` is even and `b` is odd, and `a > b`.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` should result in "Bob" winning, but the code incorrectly prints "Alice". Similarly, the condition `a > b` should also be handled correctly, but the code does not do so.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
