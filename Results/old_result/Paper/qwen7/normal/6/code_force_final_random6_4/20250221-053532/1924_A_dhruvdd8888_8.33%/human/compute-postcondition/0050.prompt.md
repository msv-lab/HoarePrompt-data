You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be the last character of the string `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing all characters `i` from `s` that are in `us` and for which `len(win) == k` at some point during the loop, `win` is an empty set, and `ps` is the count of times `ans` was appended with a character, indicating how many times `win` reached size `k` during the loop.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES'
    #State: `i` is the last character of the string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing all characters `i` from `s` that are in `us` and for which `len(win) == k` at some point during the loop, `win` is an empty set, and `ps` is the count of times `ans` was appended with a character, indicating how many times `win` reached size `k` during the loop, and `ps` is less than `n`
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `us` is an empty set, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but works with internal variables t (an integer between 1 and 10^5), n (an integer between 1 and 26), k (an integer between 1 and 26), m (an integer between 1 and 1000), and s (a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets). The function prints 'YES' if certain conditions are met based on these variables.

```

Return Postconditions: The program prints 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
