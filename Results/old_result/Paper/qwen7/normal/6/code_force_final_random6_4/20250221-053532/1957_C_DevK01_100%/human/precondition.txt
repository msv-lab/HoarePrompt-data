n is an integer representing the size of the chessboard (n x n), and t is an integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of n and k (size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played respectively), followed by k pairs of integers (r_i, c_i) representing the moves you made. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
