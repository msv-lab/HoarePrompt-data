Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`; `a` is a list with its last element being the element at index 1 of the original list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, the element at index 1 of `lit` is appended to `a`. Since `i` was 1 before the append operation, after the operation, `i` increments to 2 (assuming `i` is incremented afterward or is set to 2 immediately after the append operation). The other variables (`n`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged as per the precondition.
