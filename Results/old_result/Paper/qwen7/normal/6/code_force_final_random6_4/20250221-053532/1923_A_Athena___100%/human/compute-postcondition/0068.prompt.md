Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is 0; `a` is either an empty list or a list where no elements are 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be either empty or it will contain only non-zero integers. The variable `res` remains unchanged at 0 because the loop does not modify `res`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 0:
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `res` is 1, `a` is either an empty list or a list where no elements are 0, and `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `res` is 2, `i` is 1, and `a` is a list where no elements are 0. If `a[i]` equals 0, then `res` is set to 2 and `i` is set to 1. Since there is no else part, these changes only occur if `a[i]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`res` is 3, `i` is 2, and `a` is a list where no elements are 0. If `a[i]` equals 0, the condition does not hold and no changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
