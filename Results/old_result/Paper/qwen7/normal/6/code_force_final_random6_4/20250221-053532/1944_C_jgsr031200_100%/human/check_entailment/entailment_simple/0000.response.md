### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to her array `c`, while Bob picks elements directly from `a` without appending them to `c`. The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game, assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not match the problem description. It includes several unused functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) and a large constant `big` which is not used.
   - The relevant part of the code is the `func_1` function, which processes the input array `arr` and prints a value `i` under certain conditions.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `freq = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes a frequency array to count occurrences of each number in `arr`.
   - The loop iterates through the frequency array to find the smallest index `i` where `freq[i]` is 0 or when `cou` reaches 2.
   - If `freq[i]` is 0, it means `i` is missing from `c`, so the MEX would be `i`.
   - If `cou` reaches 2, it means there are two unique numbers in `c` already, and the next smallest number not in `c` would be printed.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game's rules or determine the optimal MEX.
   - The function does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob or the specific constraints of the game.
   - The output of the function does not align with the expected behavior of the game.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic and does not produce the correct MEX values for the given examples. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
