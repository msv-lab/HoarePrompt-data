Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to make all elements of an array equal using at most one operation where we can set a subarray to a single value `x`. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(arr)` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1(arr)` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

3. **Analyzing `func_1(arr)`**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array respectively.
   - It checks if the elements at `i` and `j` are the same. If they are, it moves both pointers inward.
   - If the elements at `i` and `j` are different, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the pointers cross each other (`i > j`), it means all elements are already the same, so it returns 0.
   - If the elements at `i` and `i+1` are the same, it moves the pointer `i` inward.
   - Finally, it returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j`.

4. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The function `func_1(arr)` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal.
   - It only checks for adjacent elements being the same and does not consider the possibility of setting a subarray to a specific value `x` to minimize the cost.
   - The logic inside the function does not handle the scenario where the array needs to be divided into multiple segments to make all elements equal.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to account for the optimal way to use the operation to make all elements equal.

Correctness: **False**
