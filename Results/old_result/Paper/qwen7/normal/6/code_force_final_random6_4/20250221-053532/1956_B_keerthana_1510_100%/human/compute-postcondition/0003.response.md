Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop is iterating over lines from the input using `[*open(0)][2::2]`.
   - The only variable involved in the loop head is `line`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are lines to read.
   - Since `[*open(0)][2::2]` skips every other line starting from the third line, the loop will continue until it runs out of lines to process.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`.
   - The first two lines of the input have already been read.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop is reading lines from the input, the next line to be processed will be the next line in the sequence.
   - Therefore, the variable `line` will contain the next line of input.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `t` remains the same: \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` remains the same: a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`.
- `line` will be the next line of input.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`, `line` is the next line of input.**
