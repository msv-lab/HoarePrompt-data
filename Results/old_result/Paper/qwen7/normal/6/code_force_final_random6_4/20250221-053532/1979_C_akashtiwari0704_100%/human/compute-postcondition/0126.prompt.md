Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the if-else block executes, `bets` will be 0, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`, each element in `a` will be updated to `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices, and `sumo` will be the sum of all these updated elements in the list `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `sumo` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` will be a string containing the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `bets` is the length of the list `a`, `i` is the length of `a`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces, and `T` is `T + (len(l) - 1) * bets`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sumo` will be the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `i` will be `len(a) + 3*bets - 3`, `bets` will ensure the loop runs the required number of times, `a` will consist of the updated values, and `prod` remains the LCM of the elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `sumo` will be greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, the loop will execute `bets` times, `i` will be `len(a) + 3*bets - 3`, `ans` will be a string containing the concatenation of the string representations of the first `bets` elements of `a`, separated by spaces, and `bets` will be a non-negative integer that satisfies `bets < len(a) + 2*bets - 3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
