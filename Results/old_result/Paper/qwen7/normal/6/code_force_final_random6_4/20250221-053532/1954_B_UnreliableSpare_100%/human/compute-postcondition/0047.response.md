Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` starts at 0, `ans` will also start at 0 if it wasn't already set.
- `flag` remains `False`.
- `val` is the initial value of `arr[0]`.
- `cnt` is 0.

The `print(-1)` statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
