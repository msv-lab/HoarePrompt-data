Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-1 integers (excluding the first and last elements), `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque minus `x`, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque minus `x`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of `a` and b.**

Explanation: The code `b -= x` subtracts the value of `x` from `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` is updated to `b - x`, while `a`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `x` retain their original values.
