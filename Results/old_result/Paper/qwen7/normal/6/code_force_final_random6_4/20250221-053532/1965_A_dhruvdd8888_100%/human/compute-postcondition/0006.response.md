Output State: **`i` is 0; `nums` is a sorted list of integers with its first element decreased by `ls`.**

Explanation: The code `nums[i] -= ls` decreases the element at index `i` (which is 0) in the list `nums` by the value of `ls`. Since `i` is 0, the first element of `nums` is modified. The other elements and their order in the list remain unchanged because no other parts of the list are accessed or modified. The precondition that `nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element is still valid.
