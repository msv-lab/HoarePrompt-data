Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is increased by `n`, `x` is the integer from `data[idx]` for each iteration, `v[x]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `data` up to the `n`-th element, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cnt`, `n`, `idx`, `x`, or `v`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
