Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange the permutation array with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at position `l`.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly in the `func_1` function. It narrows down the search range until it finds the target value or determines it's not present.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The current implementation in `func_1` only checks if `array[l]` is not equal to `x` and swaps if necessary.
   - It does not consider the possibility that `array[r+1]` might also need to be swapped to ensure `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Given the constraints and the problem statement, the original assessment correctly identified that the current implementation only handles one swap scenario and may miss the second required swap. Therefore, the logic in `func_1` needs to be revised to handle both potential swap scenarios.

However, the provided function summary of `func_1` does not accurately reflect the actual behavior of the function. The function summary states that the function prints "1" and returns a list containing "1" and the index where `find` should be inserted to maintain the permutation order if `find` is not found. This is misleading because the function actually prints "1" and returns a list containing the indices of the elements to be swapped if `find` is not found at the initial midpoint.

The function should perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` with at most 2 swaps. The current implementation does not fully address this requirement, as it only handles one swap scenario.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is still incorrect.

Final: **False**
