Output State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is the last index of the list `a`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]` if `l` is 2, and so on until `l` equals `r`, `st` is the total number of times the loop has executed, `end` is 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `l` will be equal to `r`, indicating that the loop has processed all consecutive equal elements at the start of the list `a`. The variable `st` will hold the count of how many times the loop executed, which is the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of the list.
