### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` and returns a list of divisors of `x` including both the smaller and larger divisors.
   - It iterates through all integers from 1 to the square root of `x` to find divisors.
   - For each divisor `i`, it appends both `i` and `x // i` to the lists `output1` and `output2` respectively.
   - It then reverses `output1` and returns the concatenation of `output2` and `output1`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program checks two conditions:
     - If `(n + x - 2)` is even, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the returned divisors.
     - If `(n - x)` is even, it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the returned divisors.
   - It filters the divisors to include only those that satisfy the condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - It removes duplicates using `set` and prints the length of the resulting list.

### Analysis:

- **Divisor Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the divisors of `x` and returns them in a sorted manner.
  - The logic for filtering and processing the divisors in the main part of the program is also correct.

- **Conditions for Divisors:**
  - The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `s + 2` is even, which means `s` must be even.
  - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the divisor `s` is large enough to fit the given position `x`.

- **Handling Even and Odd Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the cases where `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even by calling `func_1` and processing the results.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints. The function `func_1` correctly finds the divisors, and the main logic correctly filters and counts the valid `k` values.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
