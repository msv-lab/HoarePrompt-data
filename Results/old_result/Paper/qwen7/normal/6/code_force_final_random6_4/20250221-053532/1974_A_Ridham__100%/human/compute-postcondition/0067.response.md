Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and pairs of integers `x` and `y`. For each pair, it calculates the number of elements required based on specific conditions involving `x` and `y`. If certain conditions are met, it appends either `y // 2` or `extra_screen + y // 2` to a list. Finally, it prints each element in the list on a new line.**
