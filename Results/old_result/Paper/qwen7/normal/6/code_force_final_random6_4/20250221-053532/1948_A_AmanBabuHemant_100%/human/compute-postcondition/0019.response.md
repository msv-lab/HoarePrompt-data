Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - From the postcondition, we know that `t` must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, we only need to adjust `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer. If `n` is odd, then `n` remains odd. If `n` is even, then `n` becomes even, and `s` is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. Additionally, the length of `s` is less than 200 or exactly 200.**
