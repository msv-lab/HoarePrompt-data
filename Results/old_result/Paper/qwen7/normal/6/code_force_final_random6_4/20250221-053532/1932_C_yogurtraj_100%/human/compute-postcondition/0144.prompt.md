Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; the array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all i; the string s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = [0] * n
    y[-1] = k
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y[i] = k
    print(*y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations. Therefore, `t` is an input integer, `ii` must be an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string representation of `t`, `k` is updated based on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `q1` and `q2` are adjusted accordingly, `y` is a list of `n` zeros, and `y[i]` is now equal to `k` for all indices `i` from `0` to `n-2`. The final value of `y[0]` will be `k` after the loop completes.

This means that after all iterations, the list `y` will contain `k` repeated `n-1` times, with the last element `y[-1]` still being `k` as it was initialized.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `-1`; `k` is the final value of `k` after the loop completes, which is determined by the sequence of operations inside the loop based on the characters in `t` and the values in `a`. `y` is a list where each element from index `0` to `n-2` (inclusive) is updated to the current value of `k` after the corresponding iteration of the loop.

To understand this output state, imagine the loop has processed all its iterations. The variable `i` starts from `n-2` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`. During each iteration, `k` is updated based on whether the current character in `t` is 'R' or 'L', and `y[i]` is set to the current value of `k`. By the end of the loop, `i` will be `-1`, indicating that all iterations have been completed. The final value of `k` reflects the result of all the multiplications and mod operations performed within the loop, and the list `y` contains the intermediate results of `k` at each step of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is -1, `n` is at least 1, `k` is the final value after all iterations where `k` is updated as `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'` or `k * a[q1] % m` if `t[i] != 'R'`, `q2` is incremented by 1 every time `t[i] == 'R'`, `q1` is decremented by 1 every time `t[i] != 'R'`, `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k` after each iteration, and `y[-1]` is set to the final value of `k`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop:
- The variable `i` will be -1.
- The variable `n` will remain at least 1.
- The variable `k` will hold the product of `a[q2]` (or `a[q1]`) modulo `m` for each character in the string `t` from the end to the beginning, based on whether the character is 'R' or not.
- The variable `q2` will be incremented by 1 for each 'R' encountered from the end of the string.
- The variable `q1` will be decremented by 1 for each character that is not 'R' from the end of the string.
- The variable `y` will be a list of `n` zeros, with the last element (`y[-1]`) being the final value of `k` after the loop completes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
