Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being the first element of the list `arr`. After each iteration, `i` will take the next value from the list until all elements have been processed.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `arr`**: The list `arr` contains non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\). This means every element in `arr` is a valid index within the range of the list.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. The initial state of `i` will be set to the first element of `arr` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**`arr` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the first element of `arr`.**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the first element of `arr`**
