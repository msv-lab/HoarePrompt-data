Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and remains greater than 0; `E[out_aa]` remains less than or equal to 0; `aa[m:]` must have at least one element; `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element.**

This means that `D[out_aa]` has been decremented by 1 but still remains greater than 0. The conditions on `E[out_aa]`, `aa[m:]`, and `aa[:n - m]` remain unchanged.
