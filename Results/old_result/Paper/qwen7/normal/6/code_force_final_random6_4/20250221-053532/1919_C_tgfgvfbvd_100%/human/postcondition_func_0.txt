The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it finds the smallest and second smallest numbers in the list and counts how many numbers in the list are greater than these two smallest numbers. The function prints the count for each test case and does not return any value.
