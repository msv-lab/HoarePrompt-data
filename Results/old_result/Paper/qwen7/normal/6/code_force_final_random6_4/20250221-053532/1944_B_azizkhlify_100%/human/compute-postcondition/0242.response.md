Output State: **`i` is the fifth element from `res`, `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`, and `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`. `ul` is equal to `ur`, and `ur` is 2 more than its original value if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables but simply exits the loop or conditional block. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
