Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split, `h` is the second integer from the input split, `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`, `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`, and the current value of `x` is greater than `n`.
