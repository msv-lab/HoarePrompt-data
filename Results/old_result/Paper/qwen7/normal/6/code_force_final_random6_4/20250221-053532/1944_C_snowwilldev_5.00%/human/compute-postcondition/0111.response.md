Based on the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `i` is less than `N`.
- If `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` is increased by 1.
- The current value of `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` equals 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Let's break down the logic:

1. Initially, `i` is less than `N`.
2. If `cnt[i]` equals 1, `t` is incremented by 1.
3. After the check, it is mentioned that either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` equals 0.
4. Regardless of the above conditions, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given these points, the key observation is that `i` is incremented by 1 regardless of the conditions involving `t` and `cnt[i]`. Therefore, the value of `i` after the increment operation will be `i + 1`.

Output: **i + 1**
