Postcondition: `segments_variants` is either an empty list or contains the segment that maximizes the sum up to index `i-1` based on the comparison of the first elements of `max_segment` and `new_segment`; `new_segment` is an empty list if the condition in the if statement is true, otherwise it is a non-empty list starting with `arr[i]` and having a single element `arr[i]`; `max_segment` is updated to either `max_segment + [i - 1]` with its first element incremented by `arr[i]` if the condition in the if statement is true, or it remains `[arr[i], arr[i]]` if the condition is false; `max_sum` remains -1; `arr` has at least one element, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0 if the if condition is true, otherwise it is the value that starts the `new_segment`.
