Based on the initial state described, `ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws. If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` now includes the position `n`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

When the code snippet `print(*sorted(ans))` is executed, it will print the sorted elements of the set `ans`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider two cases:

1. If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` will include `n` after the update.
2. If `0` is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged.

In both cases, `ans` will be a set of integers representing the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws. The `sorted` function will sort these integers in ascending order, and the `*` operator will unpack the sorted set into individual elements for printing.

Therefore, the output will be the sorted elements of the set `ans`, possibly including `n` if `0` was originally in `ans`.

Output: **sorted elements of ans, possibly including n if 0 was originally in ans**
