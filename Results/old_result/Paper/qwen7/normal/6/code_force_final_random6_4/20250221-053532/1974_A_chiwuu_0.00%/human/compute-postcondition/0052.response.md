Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer converted from the first input split from `input().split()`, `b` is the second input split from `input().split()` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the string `b` into an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `b` being converted to an integer while retaining the initial conditions for the other variables.
