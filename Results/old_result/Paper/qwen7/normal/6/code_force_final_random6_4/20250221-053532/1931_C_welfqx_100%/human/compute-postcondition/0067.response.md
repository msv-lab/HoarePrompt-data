Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `ck` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `ck` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was likely 0 before this line of code). Since `n` must be greater than 2 and `ii` is 2, these conditions remain unchanged. After executing `ck += 1`, the value of `ck` becomes 1.
