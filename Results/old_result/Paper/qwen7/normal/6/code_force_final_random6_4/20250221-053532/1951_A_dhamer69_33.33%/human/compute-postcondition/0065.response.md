Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1's in the final input string `s`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be 0 since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `n` and `s` will be the last inputs provided during the loop's execution, and `count_1` will be the number of '1's in the final input string `s`.
