tree is an instance of a class representing a tree structure where each vertex has a `children` list of its child vertices, a `good_components` attribute initialized to 0, and a `remaining_size` attribute initialized to the size of the subtree rooted at that vertex. s is an integer representing the starting vertex, and x is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges.
