Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, which are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts a list named rows, which consists of n lists. Each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements being 0. The function returns a value based on the given parameters and the list rows.**

This means the function `func_2` takes in four integer parameters (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`) and a list of lists (`rows`). The list `rows` represents the depths of river cells, with certain constraints on its structure. The function then processes this information according to the given parameters and returns a result.
