Postcondition: `remaining_cells`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `t`, `n`, `result`, `x`, `y`, `screen_require_for_y`, `extra_space`, and `extra_screen` retain their initial values except that `result` is a list with one additional element. If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, then `result` has an additional element which is `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` has an additional element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`, or `extra_space // 15` otherwise, and `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
