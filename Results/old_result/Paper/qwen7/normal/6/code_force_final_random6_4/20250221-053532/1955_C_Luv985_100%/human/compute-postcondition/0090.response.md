Output State: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list using map and lambda, `l` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `l` to 0. This does not affect the values of `T`, `n`, `k`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
