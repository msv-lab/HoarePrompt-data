The loop head contains the variable `stack`, so we can only adjust this variable.

According to the code, the loop continues as long as `stack` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the stack is a list containing tuples representing vertices from the tree. For the loop to execute one more time, the stack must contain at least one tuple.

Therefore, the state of the stack needs to be adjusted to ensure it is not empty.

State: **The stack is a non-empty list containing tuples representing vertices from the tree.**
