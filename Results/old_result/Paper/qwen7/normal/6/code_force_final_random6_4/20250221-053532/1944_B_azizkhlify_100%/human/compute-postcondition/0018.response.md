Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. Here, `i` is `n + 1`, so `a[i]` is `a[n + 1]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, which means `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
