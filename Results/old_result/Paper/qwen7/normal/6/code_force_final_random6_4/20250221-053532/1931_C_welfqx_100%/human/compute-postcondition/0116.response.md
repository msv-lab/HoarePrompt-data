Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `j` is 1 (Note: `j` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it should not be adjusted here).

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. 

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` is not part of the loop head, it remains unchanged.
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.

5. **Determine the New Values**:
   - If `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, and assuming `i` was the maximum value it could have been (which would be `n - 2`), then incrementing `i` by 1 would make `i` equal to `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `n - 2` and `n` must still be at least 2.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`**.
