Output State: **`counter` is 2, `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 10^9\), and the length of `num` is at least 1, and the character `num[i]` is '0', where `i` is `len(num) - 2`**.

The value of `counter` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The conditions for `num` remain unchanged.
