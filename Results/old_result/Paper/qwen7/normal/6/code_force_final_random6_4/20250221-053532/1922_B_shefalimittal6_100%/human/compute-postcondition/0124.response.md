Output State: All iterations of the loop have completed; `idx` is equal to `n + 1`; `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of its index in `data` from the start up to the point just before the loop ended; `t` must still be greater than 0; `ans` remains unchanged as it was initially; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the index `idx` will have reached `n + 1`, indicating that all elements in `data` up to the `n`-th element have been processed. The list `v` will contain the counts of each integer value found in `data` up to the `n`-th element. The variable `t` remains unaffected and must still be greater than 0. The variables `ans` and `results` remain as they were initialized, with `ans` unchanged and `results` holding the initial value of `ans` as a string.
