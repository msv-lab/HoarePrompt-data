Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. For each test case, the function ensures that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6. The function then performs some unspecified operation on n and m for each test case and returns the results accordingly.**
