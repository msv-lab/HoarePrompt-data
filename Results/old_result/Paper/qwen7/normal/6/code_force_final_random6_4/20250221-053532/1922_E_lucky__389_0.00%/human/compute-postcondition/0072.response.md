Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `x` is 0
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10, 10, 10]
- `mx` is 10
- `ansv` is a list containing [10, 10, 10]

The `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` statement will access the element at index `i` in the list `ansv`. Since `i` is 1, it will print the second element of the list `ansv`.

Output: **10**
