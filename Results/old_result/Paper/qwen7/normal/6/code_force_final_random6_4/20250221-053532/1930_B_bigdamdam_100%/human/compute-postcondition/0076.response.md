Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range starting from 1 up to `n` with a step of 2. This means `i` will take odd values starting from 1.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `ind` is 3.
   - `i` is \(1 + n \mod 2\).
   - `n` must be greater than \(1 + n \mod 2\).
   - `p` is filled from index 0 to `n-1` with values from `ind` down to `ind - 2 \times (n // 2)`, and `p[i]` is `ind`.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is \(1 + n \mod 2\).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be an odd number and within the range of 1 to `n` with a step of 2.
   - Since `i` is currently \(1 + n \mod 2\), the next value of `i` would be the next odd number after \(1 + n \mod 2\).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will increase by 2 (since the step is 2), so if `i` was \(1 + n \mod 2\), the next value of `i` will be \(1 + n \mod 2 + 2\).
   - `n` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be \(1 + n \mod 2 + 2\).
- `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

Therefore, the updated states are:

State: **`ind` is 3, `i` is \(1 + n \mod 2 + 2\), `n` must be greater than \(1 + n \mod 2 + 2\), `p` is filled from index 0 to `n-1` with values from `ind` down to `ind - 2 \times (n // 2)\), and `p[i]` is `ind`.**
