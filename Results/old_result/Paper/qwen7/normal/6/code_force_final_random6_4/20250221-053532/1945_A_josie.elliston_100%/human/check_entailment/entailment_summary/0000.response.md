Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided functions and how they address the problem.

### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Parameters**: `extroverts` and `universals` (both non-negative integers).
- **Return Value**: 
  - If the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` is zero, it returns `None`.
  - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.

This function calculates the minimum number of tents required to accommodate `extroverts` and `universals` such that each extrovert has a tent with two others. If it's not possible (i.e., the remaining universals are less than 2), it returns `None`.

### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- **Parameters**: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` (all non-negative integers).
- **Return Value**:
  - It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals`.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so it returns `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result from `func_1`.

This function ensures that all introverts get individual tents and then uses `func_1` to handle the remaining participants.

### Problem Requirements:
- Each introvert needs a separate tent.
- Each extrovert needs a tent with two others.
- Universals can share tents in any configuration.

### Edge Cases:
1. **All Introverts**: If there are no extroverts or universals, the number of tents is simply the number of introverts.
2. **Extroverts and Universals**: The function `func_1` correctly handles the distribution of extroverts and universals into tents.
3. **Impossible Cases**: If the number of universals is insufficient to pair with all extroverts, the function correctly returns `-1`.

### Conclusion:
Both functions together correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum number of tents needed while respecting the constraints and preferences of the participants. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the functions fail to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
