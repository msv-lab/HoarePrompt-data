Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 4, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 3]`, `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 4)]**.

Explanation: The code appends the integer division of `x` by `i` (which is 4) to `output2`. Since `x` is an integer and `i` is 4, `int(x / 4)` will be the integer result of dividing `x` by 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
