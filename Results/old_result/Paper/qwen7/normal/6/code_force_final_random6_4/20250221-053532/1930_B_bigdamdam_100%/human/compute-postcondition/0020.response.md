Output State: **`p[i]` is equal to `ind`, `i` is equal to `ind + 4`, and `n` must be greater than `ind + 4`.**

Explanation: The code updates `p[i]` to be equal to `ind`. Initially, `p[i]` was equal to `ind + 2`. After the assignment, `p[i]` becomes `ind`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `ind + 4`. The condition that `n` must be greater than `ind + 4` is still valid.
