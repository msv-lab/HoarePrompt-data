### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the given program is incorrect because the formula and conditions used do not accurately represent the problem requirements. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to confirm this conclusion and ensure our reasoning is sound.

#### Step-by-Step Re-Evaluation

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `suma` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to store the count of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of `i`**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `b` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)
     \]
   - If `x` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - It then checks if both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0` hold true. If they do, it adds 1 to `suma`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all values of `i`, it prints `suma - 2`.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Formula Analysis
The formula:
\[
x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)
\]
is incorrect for determining the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This formula does not account for the actual condition that needs to be checked.

#### Condition Check
The condition checks:
\[
(a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0 \quad \text{and} \quad i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0
\]
are irrelevant to the problem. These conditions do not help in determining whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

#### Final Adjustment
The final adjustment `suma - 2` is unnecessary and incorrect. There is no specific reason provided in the problem statement for subtracting 2 from the final result.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. The formula and conditions used are incorrect, and the final adjustment is unnecessary and incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
