Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `p` is a list of n integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the rest are integers from the input split and converted to integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if v[v[i]] == i:
        print(2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `v` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `v`, and the element at index `v[i]` in the list `v` is not equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`v` is a list of integers, and `i` is an index within the list `v` such that the element at index `v[i]` in the list `v` is either not equal to `i + 1` or equal to `i`. If `v[v[i]] == i`, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function also returns None.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v` is a list of integers, and `i` is an index within the list `v`. If `v[v[i]] == i`, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function also returns `None`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is `i + 1` and `n` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
