Output State: **`idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[idx-1])`**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 1, and the value of `x` remains unchanged as it was set to `int(data[idx])` before the increment. Therefore, `x` is now equal to `int(data[idx-1])`. The value of `v[x]` is increased by 1 as per the initial state.
