### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `calculate_score`:
- **Cycle Detection**: The function correctly detects cycles in the permutation using a dictionary `visited` to track the steps taken.
- **Score Calculation**:
  - For non-cyclic parts, it simply adds the score for each turn.
  - For cyclic parts, it calculates the score for one cycle and multiplies it by the number of full cycles, then adds the score for the remaining steps.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Score Comparison**: The function correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the appropriate result.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
- **Result Collection**: It collects the results for each test case and prints them.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - **Cycle Detection**: The function uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions visited and the steps taken. When a cycle is detected, it correctly breaks out of the loop and calculates the score for the cycle.
   - **Score Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the score for non-cyclic and cyclic parts. It ensures that the score is computed accurately by considering the remaining steps after completing full cycles.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Score Comparison**: The function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha and compares their scores to determine the winner.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the input from standard input and processes each test case correctly. It uses a sliding window approach to read the input efficiently.
   - **Result Collection**: The function collects the results for each test case and prints them in the correct format.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code

1. **Initial State**:
   - Before entering `func_2`, the program initializes `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` correctly from the input.

2. **Execution of `func_2`**:
   - For each test case, the program correctly calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - The results are collected in the `results` list and printed at the end.

3. **Execution of `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both `PB` and `PS`.
   - The scores are compared, and the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') is returned.

4. **Execution of `calculate_score`**:
   - The function correctly simulates the game for up to `k` turns.
   - Cycles are detected and handled appropriately.
   - The score is calculated accurately for both non-cyclic and cyclic parts.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and the annotated code, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game for each test case. All functions handle the input and logic as specified in the problem statement.

### Final Answer
