Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string.**

The code appends the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element, which is the result of the function call. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
