Output State: **`i` is `len(b)`, `s` is the total count of times `b[i]` was found to be greater than `b[i - 1]` over all iterations, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `n`. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `input_val` must be greater than 0 is not directly affected by this code snippet, but since no operation involving `input_val` is performed, its condition remains valid.
