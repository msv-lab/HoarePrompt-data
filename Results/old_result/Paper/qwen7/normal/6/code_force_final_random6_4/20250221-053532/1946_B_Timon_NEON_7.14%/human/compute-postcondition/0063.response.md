Output State: **`segments_variants` now includes a new variant which is the concatenation of `new_segment` and the end index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`); `new_segment` remains an empty list; `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found so far; `max_sum` remains -1 since it was not updated.**

This means that the `segments_variants` list now contains one more variant, which is the combination of the current `new_segment` (which is empty) and the end index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`). The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
