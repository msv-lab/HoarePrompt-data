Output State: **`a` and `b` are elements from `nums`, and `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`; `nums` now has its leftmost element appended to itself; `k` remains unchanged unless conditions are met, otherwise `a` and `b` remain unchanged and `x` remains as the minimum of the new `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code `nums.appendleft(a)` appends the element `a` to the left end of the list `nums`. This operation does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, or `k`. Therefore, the conditions related to `a`, `b`, and `x` remain the same, and `k` remains unchanged unless the conditions specified in the postcondition are met.
