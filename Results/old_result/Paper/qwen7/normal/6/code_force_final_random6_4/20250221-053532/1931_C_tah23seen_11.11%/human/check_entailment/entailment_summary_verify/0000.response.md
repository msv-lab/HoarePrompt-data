### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's analyze the given program and function `func_1` in detail:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to determine the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation.
   - The function checks if there are any two consecutive equal elements starting from the ends of the array and moving towards the center.
   - If such elements are found, it returns the distance between them. Otherwise, it returns 1.
   - This logic is fundamentally flawed because it does not account for the possibility of making the entire array uniform by selecting a segment and setting all elements within that segment to a common value.

2. **Examples**:
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the function would return 4, which is incorrect. The optimal solution is to set the entire array to 1, which costs 6 burles.
   - For the input `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1]`, the function would return 6, which is also incorrect. The optimal solution is to set the entire array to 1, which costs 6 burles.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the minimum cost to make all elements equal by potentially performing one operation.
   - We should iterate through the array and keep track of the minimum cost to make all elements from the current position to the end of the array equal.
   - We also need to consider the possibility of setting a segment to a common value and then continuing to the next segment.

Given these points, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.
