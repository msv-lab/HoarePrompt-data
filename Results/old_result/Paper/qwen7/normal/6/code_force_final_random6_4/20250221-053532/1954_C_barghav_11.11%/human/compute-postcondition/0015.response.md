Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `x` is a non-empty string.
   - `y` is a string representing an integer.
   - `a` is a list of characters from `x` with at least one character.
   - `b` is a list of characters.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, `b[i]` is set to `n`.
   - Otherwise, `b[i]` is set to the maximum of `a[i]` and `n`.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is a non-empty string.
   - `y` is a string representing an integer.
   - `a` is a list of characters from `x` with at least one character.
   - `b` is a list of characters.
   - `i` is the last value it took during the previous iteration (let's call this value `i_last`).

5. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `i_last + 1`.

6. **Determine the State of `b` for the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to check if `i_last + 1` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one.
     - If true, then `b[i_last + 1]` will be set to `n`.
     - If false, then `b[i_last + 1]` will be set to the maximum of `a[i_last + 1]` and `n`.

7. **Adjust the States:**
   - `x` remains a non-empty string.
   - `y` remains a string representing an integer.
   - `a` remains a list of characters from `x` with at least one character.
   - `b` will have its value updated based on the condition above.

Given the above steps, let's summarize the states that need to be adjusted:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `b[i_last + 1]` will be updated based on the condition.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is a non-empty string, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters from `x` with at least one character, `b` is a list of characters where `b[i_last + 1]` is either `n` if `i_last + 1` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, otherwise `b[i_last + 1]` is the maximum of `a[i_last + 1]` and `n`.**
