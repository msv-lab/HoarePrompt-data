Output State: **`l` must have at least one integer element, `ele` is the next integer in `l`, `c` is now `c + ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum of the current value of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`. The values of `l`, `ele`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
