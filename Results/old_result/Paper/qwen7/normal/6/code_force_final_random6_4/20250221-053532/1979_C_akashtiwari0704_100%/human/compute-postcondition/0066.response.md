Output State: **`sumo` is `0 + prod // a[i] + int(a[i])`, `bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `a[i]` is unchanged**

Explanation: The code `a[i] = prod // a[i]` updates the value of `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`. Since `a[i]` was already equal to `prod // a[i]` before the code execution, the value of `a[i]` remains unchanged. All other variables (`sumo`, `bets`, `i`) retain their previous states.
