Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers created from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements (assuming space-separated integers), converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `nums`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be at least 2, `n` remains an input integer, and `nums` is now a list of integers derived from the user's input.
