Output State: **`i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is the opposite of its previous value, `bc` is the previous value of `bc` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `bc += 1` increments the value of `bc` by 1. Since `bc` was previously either 1 or 2, it now becomes 2 or 3, respectively. The values of `i` and `ac` remain unchanged from their initial states.
