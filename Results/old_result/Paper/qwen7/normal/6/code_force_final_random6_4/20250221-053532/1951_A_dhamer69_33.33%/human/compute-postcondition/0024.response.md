Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.
- `n` is not equal to 2.
- `count_1` is even.
- The string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11'.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` without any variables or conditions affecting it. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
