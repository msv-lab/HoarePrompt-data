Output State: The `hcf` is the greatest common factor of all the elements in the list `numbers`, and `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `hcf` will have been updated in each iteration to be the greatest common factor of itself and the next element in the list `numbers`. Therefore, by the end of the loop, `hcf` will hold the greatest common factor of all the elements in the list `numbers`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
