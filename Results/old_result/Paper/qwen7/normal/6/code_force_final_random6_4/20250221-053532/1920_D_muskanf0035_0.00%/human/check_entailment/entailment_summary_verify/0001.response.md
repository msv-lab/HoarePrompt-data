### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `array = []`: Initializes an empty list.
   - `result = []`: Initializes an empty list to store results.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - The function iterates through each operation.
   - If the operation type (`op_type`) is 1, it appends the value to the `array`.
   - If the operation type is 2, it extends the `array` by repeating its current content `value` times.

3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, it calculates the index using the modulo operation: `(k - 1) % len(array)`.
   - This ensures that the index wraps around the array, which is necessary when the array size exceeds the query index.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries respectively.
   - Reads the operations and stores them in a list.
   - Reads the queries and stores them in a list.

2. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - Calls `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
   - Prints the results.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly handles both types of operations:
  - Appending a single value (type 1).
  - Extending the array by repeating its current content (type 2).
- The query handling in `func_1` uses the modulo operation to handle large indices efficiently, ensuring that the index wraps around the array size.
- However, there is a critical issue with the way the array is extended in `func_1`. When extending the array by repeating its current content, the function should append the entire array `value` times, not just the elements. The current implementation only repeats the elements of the array, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following sequence of operations:
- Operation 1: Append 1
- Operation 2: Append 2
- Operation 3: Extend by 2 (should result in `[1, 2, 1, 2]`)

The current implementation would produce:
- Operation 1: Append 1 -> `[1]`
- Operation 2: Append 2 -> `[1, 2]`
- Operation 3: Extend by 2 -> `[1, 2, 1, 2]`

However, the correct implementation should be:
- Operation 3: Extend by 2 -> `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`

This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results for queries that fall within the newly appended segments.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` incorrectly implements the extension operation, leading to incorrect results for certain queries.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
