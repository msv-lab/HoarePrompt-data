Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, arr is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
