Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `segment` does not exist because there are no elements left in `segments_variants`, `new_segment` remains an empty list, `max_segment` remains unchanged as it holds the segment with the highest sum found so far during the loop's execution, `max_sum` remains -1 since it was not updated after the last iteration, and `total_max_segment` is now [-1].**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `[-1]` to the variable `total_max_segment`. This means that `total_max_segment` is now explicitly set to the list containing the single element `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
