Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ls` is the original value of `ls` plus the first element of `nums`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `len(nums)`. Therefore, `i` should be 1 and `len(nums)` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` needs to be adjusted to 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue requires `len(nums)` to be greater than 1.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ls` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (original value of `ls` plus the first element of `nums`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 1, `ls` is the original value of `ls` plus the first element of `nums`, `len(nums)` must be greater than 1**
