`t` is decremented by 1, so the value of `t` is now `t - 1`. The values of the other variables (`start`, `end`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1's in the new input string `s`. If `n == 2`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, `count_1` is calculated as the count of '1's in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the postcondition remains unchanged. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11', the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
