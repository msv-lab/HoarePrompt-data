### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the correctness of the given program step-by-step.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n`.
   - The program then calls `func_2(n)` to process the graph for the current test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an integer `d` as input and prints a query `? d`.
   - It then reads two integers `v` and `u` from the input.
   - The function returns `v` and `u`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function initializes an empty list `path` to store the Hamiltonian path.
   - It also initializes a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
   - The function enters a loop that continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty.
     - For each `d` from `n-1` down to 0, it calls `func_1(d)` to get `v` and `u`.
     - If `v` is 0, it skips to the next iteration.
     - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
   - After the loop, the function prints the path as a sequence of vertices.

### Analysis of Functionality:

1. **Query Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the query and returns the expected values `v` and `u`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes the responses from `func_1` and constructs the path.

2. **Path Construction:**
   - The path construction logic in `func_2` ensures that all vertices are included in the path.
   - The loop iterates through possible degrees `d` and uses the responses to add vertices to the path.
   - The path is constructed by removing vertices that satisfy the condition `v in remaining_vertices`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case when `v` is 0 by skipping to the next iteration, ensuring that vertices not in the graph are ignored.
   - The program ensures that all vertices are included in the path before terminating.

4. **Hamiltonian Path Guarantee:**
   - The problem guarantees that a Hamiltonian path exists in the graph.
   - The program constructs a path by iteratively removing vertices, ensuring that all vertices are included in the path.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path using the specified queries and responses. The program ensures that all vertices are included in the path and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
