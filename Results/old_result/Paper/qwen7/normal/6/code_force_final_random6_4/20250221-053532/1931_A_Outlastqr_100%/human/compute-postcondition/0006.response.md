Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 52, `word` is a string equal to `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.**

Explanation: The code appends the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz' to the `word` string. Since `n` is an integer greater than 52, `n - 53` will be a non-negative integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
