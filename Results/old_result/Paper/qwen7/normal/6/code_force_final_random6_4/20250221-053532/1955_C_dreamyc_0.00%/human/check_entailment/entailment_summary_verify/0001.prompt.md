You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:

        else:
            ans += 1
    if k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0]):
        return ans + 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums (a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It processes the list `nums` by repeatedly removing the smallest pair of elements, reducing them by their minimum value, and decrementing `k` accordingly. This process continues until `k` becomes zero or there are fewer than two elements left in `nums`. The function counts the number of times any element in the current pair is reduced to zero and returns this count plus one if the last remaining element (if any) can still be reduced by `k`, otherwise it simply returns the count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability of each ship into a list `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes `n`, `k`, and `nums` as parameters.
   - It converts `nums` into a deque for efficient popping from both ends.
   - It initializes `ans` to count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than 0 and there are at least 2 ships left (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements of the deque, denoted as `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between `a` and `b` and checks if `k` is sufficient to reduce both durabilities by this minimum value.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the minimum durability, it reduces `a` and `b` by this value, decrements `k` by twice the minimum durability, and appends the non-zero values back to the deque.
   - If `k` is insufficient, the loop breaks.
   - After each reduction, it increments `ans` by 1 for each ship that has sunk (i.e., its durability is reduced to 0).

4. **Final Check**:
   - After exiting the loop, if there is one ship left and `k` is still sufficient to sink it, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns `ans`.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Initial Durabilities**:
   - The program correctly handles the initial durabilities of the ships.

2. **Attacks**:
   - The program correctly simulates the attacks by reducing the durability of the first and last ships in each iteration.
   - It ensures that once a ship sinks (durability becomes 0), it is no longer considered in future attacks.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the scenario where all ships sink before the specified number of attacks.
   - It also correctly handles the final check for the last remaining ship.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program accurately simulates the attacks and counts the number of sunk ships.
