Output State: `t` is 1, `i` is 2, and `N` is greater than 0.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, after the loop has executed 3 times, we know that `t` is 1, `i` is 2, and `N` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop has completed its execution, no further changes will occur to these variables. Therefore, the final output state is `t` is 1, `i` is 2, and `N` is greater than 0.
