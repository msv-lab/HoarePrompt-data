Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'**.

Explanation: The code `h = 12` assigns the value 12 to the variable `h`. All other variables (`t`, `day`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
