You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` and then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, checks if `n` is even, and either prints 'NO' or constructs a string `s` consisting of 'AAB' repeated `(n // 2)` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by `s`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Checking if `n` is Odd:**
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2`), the program prints "NO". This is correct because an odd number of special characters cannot be achieved with the given rules since each special character requires two non-special neighbors, which would make the total count even.

3. **Generating the String:**
   - If `n` is even, the program attempts to generate a string using the pattern `'AAB'`.
   - It repeats the pattern `'AAB'` `(n // 2)` times to form the string `s`.
   - It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200.
     - If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string `s`.
     - If the length exceeds 200, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program

1. **Pattern Generation:**
   - The pattern `'AAB'` does not always produce a valid string where each character is special.
   - For example, in the string `AAABAACC`, the pattern works, but other patterns like `AAB` repeated might not work for all cases.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program fails to handle cases where a valid string can be formed but the pattern `'AAB'` is not sufficient.
   - For instance, when `n = 2`, the string `MM` is a valid solution, but the program would incorrectly print "NO" because the length of the string is 2, which is less than 200.

### Example Test Cases

1. **Test Case: `n = 6`**
   - Expected output: `YES\nAAABAACC`
   - Program output: `YES\nAAABAACC` (Correct)

2. **Test Case: `n = 1`**
   - Expected output: `NO`
   - Program output: `NO` (Correct)

3. **Test Case: `n = 2`**
   - Expected output: `YES\nMM`
   - Program output: `NO` (Incorrect)

4. **Test Case: `n = 4`**
   - Expected output: `YES\nAABB`
   - Program output: `YES\nAABBAABB` (Incorrect, should be `AABB`)

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly generate a valid string for all cases, particularly when `n` is small or when a simpler pattern can achieve the goal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
