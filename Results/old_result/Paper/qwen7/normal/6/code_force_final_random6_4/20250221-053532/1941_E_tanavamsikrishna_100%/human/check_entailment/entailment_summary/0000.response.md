### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and ensure it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list `row` representing the depths of river cells and an integer `d` representing the maximum distance between supports.
   - It initializes the first `d` elements of `row` by incrementing them by 2.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the smallest values within the last `d` elements of `row`.
   - For each subsequent element in `row`, it updates the value by adding the smallest value from the heap plus 1, then pushes the new value back into the heap.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the updated `row`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input parameters \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \).
   - It reads the depths of the river cells for each row and stores them in a list of lists `rows`.
   - It computes the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in a list `costs`.
   - It calculates the total cost for every possible set of \( k \) consecutive rows by summing the corresponding elements in `costs`.
   - It finds and prints the minimum total cost among all such sums.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The input is read correctly, and the dimensions and depths are stored appropriately.

2. **Cost Calculation per Row:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates the cost for each row according to the rules provided. It ensures that the first and last elements are supported and maintains the required distance between supports.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The `func_2` function correctly calculates the total cost for each set of \( k \) consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

4. **Output:**
   - The output is the minimum total cost, which matches the problem requirement.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. All functions work together to compute the desired result accurately.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
