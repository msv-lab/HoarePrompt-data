Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from it, and assigns the result to `b`. The values of `t`, `results`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
