Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    a1 = s1.count('1')
    a2 = s2.count('1')
    hd = a1 - a2
    res = abs(a1 - a2)
    for i in range(n):
        if hd > 0:
            hd -= 1
            continue
        if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations, `n` must be equal to `i`, `res` will be the sum of all occurrences where `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'` for all valid `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `hd` will be the difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2` at the end of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `hd` is `a1 - a2 - n`, `n` is 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + 3`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is 5, and if `hd > 0`, then `hd` is adjusted to `a1 - a2 - n - 1` (which simplifies to `a1 - a2 - n - 1`), `n` is decremented by 1, and `res` remains unchanged; otherwise, `n` remains 0 and `res` remains unchanged.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `hd` will be `a1 - a2 - n`, where `n` is the original number of iterations specified. The variable `res` will be the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + 3`, indicating the net change in the count of '1's from `s1` to `s2` considering the conditions inside the loop. The variable `i` will be `n + 1`, which is the index just after the last iteration. If there were more iterations possible (`hd > 0`), the loop would adjust `hd` and decrement `n` accordingly, but since `n` is 0 at the end, no further adjustments are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `hd` will be equal to its initial value minus `n` if `n` is less than or equal to the length of `s1` and `s2`, and `res` will be the sum of the absolute differences between the counts of '1's in `s1` and `s2` up to index `n-1` where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
