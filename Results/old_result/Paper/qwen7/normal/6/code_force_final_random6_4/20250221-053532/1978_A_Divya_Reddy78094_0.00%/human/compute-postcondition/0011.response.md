Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is at least 2.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 2.
   - `n` is an input integer (this does not change within the loop).
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers in descending order (this also does not change within the loop).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `t` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue, after one iteration, `t` will be reduced by 1. Therefore, if `t` was at least 2 before the iteration, it will now be at least 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 2 again.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in descending order**.
