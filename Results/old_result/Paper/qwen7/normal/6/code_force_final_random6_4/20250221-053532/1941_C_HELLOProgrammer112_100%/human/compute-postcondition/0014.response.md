Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will run based on the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a` is the new input integer
   - `s` is the new input string from the user
   - `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`
   - `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`
   - `z` is equal to the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (since it's a positive integer and the loop runs based on this value).

4. **Update the States**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the value of `int(input())` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration to ensure the loop continues.
   - All other variables (`a`, `s`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `int(input())` must be decremented by 1.
- `a`, `s`, `x`, `y`, `z` remain the same.

Given that `t` was the initial value of `int(input())` and it must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration, the updated state is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\), `a` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string from the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is equal to the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`**.
