You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, with n not equal to 0. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `position` is the number of times `n` can be right-shifted until it becomes 0, `n` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to right-shift `n` by 1 bit until `n` becomes 0. The variable `position` keeps track of how many times the loop has executed, which is equivalent to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. Therefore, once `n` becomes 0, the loop terminates, and `position` will be the total number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `n`.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns a value that is one less than the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `t`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer within the range of 1 to 10^4. Depending on the value of `n`, the function either returns -1 or a value that is one less than the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `t`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns a value that is one less than the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `t`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
