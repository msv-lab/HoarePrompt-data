Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `nums`. The conditions that `t` must be at least 2 and `n` is an input integer remain unchanged.
