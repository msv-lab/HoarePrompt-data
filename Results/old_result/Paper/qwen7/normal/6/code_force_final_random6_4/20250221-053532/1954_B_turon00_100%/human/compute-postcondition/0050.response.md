Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
   - `ans` is either `n` or `2`.
   - `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again if `i` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - `tmp` remains unchanged because it is based on the initial value of the list `a` and does not change within the loop.
   - `ans` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `cnt` will be updated based on the new value of `a[i]` (which is now `a[i+1]`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `cnt` will be 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` will be 0.

Since `ans` and `tmp` remain unchanged, the final state is:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is less than `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is either `n` or `2`, `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.** 

However, for the specific next iteration, we need to explicitly state the updated values:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is either `n` or `2`, `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.**
