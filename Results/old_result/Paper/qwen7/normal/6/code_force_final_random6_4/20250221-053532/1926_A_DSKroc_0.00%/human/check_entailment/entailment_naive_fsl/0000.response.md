Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly. Since the string length is fixed at 5, and the program iterates through each character to count occurrences, it will always produce the correct result for any valid input string consisting of 'A' and 'B'. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the problem description.
