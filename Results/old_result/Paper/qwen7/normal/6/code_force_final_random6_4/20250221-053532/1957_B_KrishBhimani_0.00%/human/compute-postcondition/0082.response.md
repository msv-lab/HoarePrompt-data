Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `arr`**:
   - `i` is initially set to 16.
   - `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191].

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`. Therefore, `i` will take on each value in `arr` sequentially.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to 16, it does not match any value in `arr`. Hence, the loop will not execute because the initial value of `i` (16) is not in `arr`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be one of the values in `arr`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `i` is one of the values in `arr`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be one of the values in `arr` = [0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191]**
