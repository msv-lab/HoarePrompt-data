Output State: **`ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws except 0, and `temp` is equal to `ans` after the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the element `0` from the set `ans`. The other elements in `ans` remain unchanged. The variable `temp` is not affected by this operation and retains its previous value, which is equal to `ans` after the last iteration of the loop.
