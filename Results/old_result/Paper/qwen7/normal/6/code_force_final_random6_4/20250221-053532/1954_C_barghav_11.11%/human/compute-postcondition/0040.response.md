Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(a))`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `0` and `len(a)` must be at least `1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < len(a)`. 

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `0` and increases by `1` each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will become `1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Given that `i` is now `1`, `len(a)` must still be at least `2` (because `1 < 2` is true, but `1 < 1` would not be).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is `1` and `len(a)` must be at least `2`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `1`, `len(a)` must be at least `2`**
