Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
   - `i` is 4.
   - `output1` is a list containing `[1, 3]`.
   - `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 4)]` if `x` is divisible by 4. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `5`.

5. **Determine the new value of `x`**:
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` changes from `4` to `5`.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 5, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 3]`, and `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 4)]` if `x` is divisible by 4. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.**
