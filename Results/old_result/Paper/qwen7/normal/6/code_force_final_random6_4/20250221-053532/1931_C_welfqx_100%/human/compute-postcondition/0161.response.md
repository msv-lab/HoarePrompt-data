Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `f` is 0
   - The loop breaks if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n - 1`.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` should be set to 0 for the next iteration.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `f` remains unchanged.

6. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` is 0
   - `n` is still a positive integer
   - `f` is still 0

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and `f` is 0**
