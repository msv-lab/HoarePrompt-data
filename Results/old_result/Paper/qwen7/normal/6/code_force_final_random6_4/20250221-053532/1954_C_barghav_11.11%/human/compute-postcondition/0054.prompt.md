Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `a` and `b` are modified according to the described rules, and the loop has executed for as many times as there are elements in `a`.

To explain this in natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. This means the loop has run once for each element in `a`. The lists `a` and `b` have been modified such that for each index `i` up to the length of `a`:
- If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, `b[i]` is set to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `a[i]` is set to the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- If `i` is greater than half the length of `a` minus one, `b[i]` is set to the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `a[i]` is set to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

The loop body only prints the current value of `a[i]` without affecting the values of `a` and `b` directly during the print operation. Therefore, the final states of `a` and `b` reflect the transformations applied during each iteration based on the conditions provided.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `b` is a list with at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `b` is a list with at least 3 elements




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
