Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is 0, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)` and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged, and the loop continues.
