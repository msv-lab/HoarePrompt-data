Output State: `remaining_vertices` is empty, `d` is -1, `n` is less than or equal to 0, and `path` contains a sequence of vertices from the loop, ending with the last `u` value encountered before the loop terminates. The loop will continue decrementing `d` until it reaches -1, and for each iteration, it will call `func_1(d)` to get `v` and `u`. If `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, it will be added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`, then the loop breaks. If `v` is 0 or not in `remaining_vertices`, the loop continues until `d` reaches -1. Once `d` is -1, the loop terminates.
