### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, which is not consistent with the problem statement where the input should be a binary string.
   - It splits the input into a list of integers, which is incorrect for a binary string.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the binary string through cyclic shifts.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify segments of '1's and '0's and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all '1's to the beginning of the string.
   - For each segment of '0's between two '1's, the cost is the length of the segment plus the length of the segment of '1's before it.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
