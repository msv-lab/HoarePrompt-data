Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list containing either ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`, or ['new_segment', 'i - 1'] if the first element of `max_segment` is not greater than the first element of `new_segment`; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is updated to either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment`; `max_sum` remains -1; `arr` has at least one element, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `segments_variants`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, or `arr`. The only change is that `new_segment` is now an empty list. The conditions for `segments_variants` remain the same as they were before the code was executed.
