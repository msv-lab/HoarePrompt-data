Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`, if `ul` is equal to `ur`, then the condition holds true; `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the value of `r` at the index `a[i] - 1` to 0. Since `i` is `n + 1`, `a[i]` would refer to `a[n + 1]`. However, without knowing the exact value of `a[n + 1]`, we can only say that `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is set to 0. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
