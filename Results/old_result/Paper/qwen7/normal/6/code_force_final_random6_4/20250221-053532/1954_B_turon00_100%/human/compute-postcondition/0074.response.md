Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, `cnt` is 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `cnt = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
