Output State: **`max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, and `new_segment` is now `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, `new_segment` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` increases the value of `max_segment[0]` by the value of `arr[i]`. Additionally, if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` remains unchanged.
