Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is equal to `n * 2 + 1`, `n` is replaced by an input integer, and `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition for `t` is still valid. Therefore, `ans` is still 0, `i` is still equal to `n * 2 + 1`, `n` is now an input integer, and `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`.
