Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic in the function matches the requirements of the problem statement. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Processing**: The function reads multiple lines of input from standard input. Each line contains two integers \( n \) and \( k \), representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that must have at least one colored cell, respectively.

2. **Conditions and Calculations**:
   - The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2)` calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( k / 2 \).
   - The condition `k < 4 * n - 3` checks if the required number of diagonals is less than the total number of diagonals minus 3.
   - The condition `k >= 4 * n - 3` checks if the required number of diagonals is greater than or equal to the total number of diagonals minus 3.
   - The condition `k == 4 * n - 2` checks if the required number of diagonals is exactly the total number of diagonals minus 2.

3. **Formulas Used**:
   - If \( k < 4 * n - 3 \), the formula is \((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)\). This ensures that the minimum number of cells to be colored is proportional to the number of diagonals required.
   - If \( k \geq 4 * n - 3 \), the formula is \(2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)\). This ensures that the minimum number of cells to be colored is proportional to the size of the grid.
   - If \( k == 4 * n - 2 \), the formula is \((k == 4 * n - 2)\). This ensures that the minimum number of cells to be colored is exactly twice the size of the grid minus 2.

Given the problem constraints and the example test cases, the logic in the function appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of cells to be colored based on the conditions provided.

Correctness: **True**
