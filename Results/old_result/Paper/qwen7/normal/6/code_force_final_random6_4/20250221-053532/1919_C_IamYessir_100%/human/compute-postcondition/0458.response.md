Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the last element of the list `b`, if the list `a` is empty, `x` is infinity, otherwise `x` is the last element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The state of the list `a` and its effect on `x` remains the same as well.
