Output State: **`monsters` is a list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`, `can_survive` is False.**

Explanation: The code assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `can_survive`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state. The condition `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k` still holds true.
