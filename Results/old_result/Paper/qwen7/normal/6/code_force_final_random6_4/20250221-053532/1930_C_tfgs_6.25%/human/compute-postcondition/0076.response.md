Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(a)`.
- `ans` contains a sequence of decremented values starting from the initial last element of `a` and decreasing by 1 for each iteration.
- `cnt` is reduced to `0`.
- `counter` shows the final counts of each element in `a` after all elements have been processed and their counts decremented according to the loop's logic.

The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces. Since `ans` is constructed by decrementing the last element of `a` by 1 for each iteration, the exact values depend on the initial last element of `a`.

Let's denote the initial last element of `a` as `last_element_of_a`. Then, `ans` will contain `[last_element_of_a, last_element_of_a - 1, last_element_of_a - 2, ..., 1, 0]`.

Output: **last_element_of_a last_element_of_a - 1 last_element_of_a - 2 ... 1 0 (where last_element_of_a is the last element of the list `a`)**
