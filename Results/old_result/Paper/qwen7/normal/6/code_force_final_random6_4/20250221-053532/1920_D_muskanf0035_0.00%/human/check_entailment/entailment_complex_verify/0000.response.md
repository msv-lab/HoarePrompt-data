### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   array = []
   result = []
   ```
   - `array` starts as an empty list.
   - `result` is also initialized as an empty list.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   ```python
   for (op_type, value) in operations:
       if op_type == 1:
           array.append(value)
       else:
           array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
   ```
   - For each operation:
     - If `op_type` is 1, the value is appended to `array`.
     - If `op_type` is 2, the array is extended by repeating its current elements `value` times.
   
   The key issue here is the use of `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`. This line attempts to repeat the current elements of the array, but it does not correctly simulate appending `x` copies of the entire current array. Instead, it creates a new list with repeated elements of the current array, which is not the same as appending `x` copies of the entire array.

3. **Processing Queries**:
   ```python
   for k in queries:
       result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
   ```
   - For each query, the result is calculated using the formula `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       n, q = map(int, input().split())
       operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
       queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
       result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
       print(*result)
   ```
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n`, the number of queries `q`, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
   - It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the results.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:

Consider the example test case provided in the problem description:
- `n = 5`
- `q = 10`
- Operations: 
  - `(1, 1)`
  - `(1, 2)`
  - `(2, 1)`
  - `(1, 3)`
  - `(2, 3)`
- Queries: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 16, 20`

Expected array after operations:
1. Append 1: `[1]`
2. Append 2: `[1, 2]`
3. Append 1 copy of the current array: `[1, 2, 1, 2]`
4. Append 3: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
5. Append 3 copies of the current array: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`

However, the program incorrectly handles the operation `(2, 1)` and `(2, 3)`:
- After `(2, 1)`, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, but the program incorrectly repeats the elements.
- After `(2, 3)`, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`, but the program incorrectly repeats the elements.

This discrepancy can be observed in the test case output, where the array size and content do not match the expected behavior.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the operations as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
