Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `cnt` is either 0 or 1.
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 1 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.

3. **Determine the changes for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is defined before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The values of `cnt` and `ans` are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 1 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
