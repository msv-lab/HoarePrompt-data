Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `a` remains unchanged, `inx` remains unchanged, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `ans[4]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `ans[i] = 1` updates the value of `ans[4]` to 1 because `i` is 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
