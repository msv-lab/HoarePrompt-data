The function processes the outcomes of `func_1()` and `func_3()` to determine all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws among `n` players. Initially, the ball starts with player `x`. For each throw, based on the distance and direction provided, it updates the possible positions of the ball. If position `0` is included in the final set of possible positions, it is replaced with position `n`. Finally, it prints the count of these possible positions and their sorted values.
