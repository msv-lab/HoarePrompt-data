Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the condition `i < n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body updates the state based on the conditions involving `lft[i]`, `lft[i-1]`, and `lft[i+1]`. Specifically:
   - If `lft[i]` equals `lft[i-1]`, then `ldb` contains the value of `lft[i]` and `sng` is updated accordingly.
   - If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i+1]`, then `sng` is updated to include `lft[i]`.
   - Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `sng` is a list.
   - If `lft[i]` equals `lft[i-1]`, then `ldb` contains the value of `lft[i]` and `sng` is updated.
   - If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i+1]`, then `sng` is updated to include `lft[i]`.
   - Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `sng` will depend on the values of `lft[i]`, `lft[i-1]`, and `lft[i+1]` as per the conditions mentioned.

Since we don't have specific values for `lft`, we can only state the general conditions under which `sng` will be updated.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `sng` is a list that may be updated based on the conditions involving `lft[i]`, `lft[i-1]`, and `lft[i+1]`**.
