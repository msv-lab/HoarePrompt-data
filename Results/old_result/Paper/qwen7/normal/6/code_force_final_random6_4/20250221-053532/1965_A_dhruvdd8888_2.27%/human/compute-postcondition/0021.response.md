Postcondition: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3 and the first element is 0, `i` is 0 or 1, and if the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is 1, then `cd` is 1. Otherwise, the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
