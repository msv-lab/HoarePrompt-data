Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(b))`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `b` is a list with at least one element

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(b)`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `len(b)` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(b)` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1
- `b` is a list with at least 2 elements (since `len(b)` must be greater than 1)

State: **`i` is 1, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements**
