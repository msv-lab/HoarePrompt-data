To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans`.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `l` is the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`.
   - `r` is `r - 1`.
   - `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`.
   - `st` is the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`.
   - `end` equals `end + 3`.
   - `ans` is calculated based on the following conditions:
     - If `st` is not equal to 0, or `end` is not equal to 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l`.
     - Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l - 1`.

2. **Calculation of `ans`**:
   - Since `r` is `r - 1`, it implies that `r` is being decremented by 1.
   - `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, meaning the last element in the list is the same as the second-to-last element.
   - `st` is the same as `l`, so `st` is also the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`.
   - `end` is incremented by 3, so `end` is now `end + 3`.

Given these conditions, let's consider the possible scenarios for `ans`:

- If `st` is not 0, or `end` is not 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l - 1`.

Since `r` is `r - 1`, and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, it suggests that the last two elements are the same. This could imply that `a[0]` might also be equal to `a[-1]` depending on the list's structure. However, without the exact list, we cannot definitively say if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.

Assuming the simplest case where `a[0]` is not necessarily equal to `a[-1]`, and considering the conditions, `ans` would likely be `r - l` because the other conditions (`st` not equal to 0 or `end` not equal to 0) are more general and easier to satisfy.

Therefore, the value of `ans` is `r - l`.

Finally, the `print(max(0, ans))` statement will print the maximum of 0 and `ans`. Since `ans` is `r - l` and assuming `r` and `l` are non-negative integers, `r - l` will be a non-negative integer, making `max(0, r - l)` simply `r - l`.

Output: **r - l**
