Output State: **`can_survive` is False, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health of all the monsters, `monsters` is an empty list, `pos` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
