Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the specified conditions. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Number of Test Cases**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `n`, from the input.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Conditions Check**:
   - It checks if \(a < b < c\) and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
   - It checks if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\) and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case directly, which aligns with the requirement to output 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each test case.

Given that the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all possible cases as outlined in the example, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
