The code `h = h - 12` subtracts 12 from the value of `h`. Since `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':', the new value of `h` will be the original value of `h` minus 12. The other variables (`t`, `day`, `n`, `m`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the original value of `h` minus 12, `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'**
