Output State: **`ur` is increased by 4, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increases the value of `ur` by 2. Since the initial state mentions `ur` is increased by either 2 or 4, and the code adds exactly 2 to `ur`, the new value of `ur` is increased by 4 (2 + 2). The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
