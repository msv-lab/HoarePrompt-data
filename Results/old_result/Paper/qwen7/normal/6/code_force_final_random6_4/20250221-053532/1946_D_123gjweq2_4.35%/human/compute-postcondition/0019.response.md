Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`, which iterates over each element in `cur_arr`.
   - The loop does not directly modify `cur_arr`, but it does affect the condition under which the loop continues.

2. **Understand the Precondition and Postcondition:**
   - At the start of the loop, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element.
   - The loop body (which is omitted) presumably performs some operations on the elements of `cur_arr`.
   - After the loop, if the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `0`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the precondition.

3. **Determine the Impact of the Loop on the State:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `cur_arr`, the length of `cur_arr` will decrease by one with each iteration until the loop terminates.
   - The loop will terminate when `cur_arr` becomes empty or when the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` is 0.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_arr` must still have at least one element.
   - Therefore, `cur_arr` must have at least two elements before the next iteration starts.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `cur_arr` has at least two elements.

**Answer:**
State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least two elements**.
