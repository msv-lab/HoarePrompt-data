Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `ii` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - If `onum[0]` is equal to `onum[1]`, then `ck` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for ii in range(n - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `ii`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `ii` is less than `n - 1`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `ii` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `n` is greater than 1, it remains unchanged.

6. **Post-Iteration State**: After incrementing `ii` by 1, the new state will be:
   - `ii` is 1
   - `n` is still greater than 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
