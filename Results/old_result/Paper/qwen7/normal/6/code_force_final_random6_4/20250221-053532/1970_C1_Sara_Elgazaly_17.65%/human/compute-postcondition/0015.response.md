Output State: **`s` is True, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` both contain a list of integers representing all the nodes connected to `a` and `b` respectively through the edges defined by the inputs during each iteration of the loop, `x` must be greater than 2×10^5 since the loop runs `x-1` times and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.**

Explanation: The line `s = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `s`. None of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `lst`, or `x`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
