Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and k > 0`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `T` is False.
   - `n` is an integer value.
   - `k` is adjusted based on the condition (either `k - 2 * mi` or remains as is).
   - `l` is either 1 or 0.
   - `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`.
   - `ans` is either 2 or 1.
   - `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`.
   - `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `k > 0`.
   - Therefore, the variables `l`, `r`, and `k` are the ones that need to be adjusted.

4. **Adjust the Variables**:
   - For `l < r` to be true, `l` must be less than `r`.
   - For `k > 0` to be true, `k` must be greater than 0.

5. **Consider the Possible Values**:
   - `l` can be either 1 or 0.
   - `r` can be either `n - 2` or `n - 1`.
   - `k` can be adjusted based on the condition, but it must be greater than 0.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - To ensure `l < r`, `l` must be 1 and `r` must be `n - 2` (since `r` cannot be `n - 1` because then `l` would not be less than `r`).
   - To ensure `k > 0`, `k` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is either 2 or 1, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.**
