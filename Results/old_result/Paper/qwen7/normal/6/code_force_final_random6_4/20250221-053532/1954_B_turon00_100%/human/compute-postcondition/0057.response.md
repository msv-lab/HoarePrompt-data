Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is either 2 if `a[i]` equals `tmp` plus 1, or 0 if `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`. `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain in their previous states relative to the initial conditions, with `cnt` updated according to whether `a[i]` equals `tmp`.
