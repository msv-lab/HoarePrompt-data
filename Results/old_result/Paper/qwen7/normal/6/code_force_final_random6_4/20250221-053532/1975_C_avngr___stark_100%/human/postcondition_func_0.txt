Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer \( n \) (with \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)) followed by \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (each between 1 and \( 10^9 \)). For each test case, the function finds the maximum value among the second smallest elements of all possible sublists of three consecutive elements in the list \( a \), and prints this value. If \( n \) is 2, it simply prints the minimum of the two elements.
