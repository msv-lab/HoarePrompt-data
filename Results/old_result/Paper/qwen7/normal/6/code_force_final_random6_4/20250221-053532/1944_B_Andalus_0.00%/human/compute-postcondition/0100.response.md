Output State: **`sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`, and `sz` is `sz_prev + 1`, `sz` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the sequence `sng` remains unchanged, and the variable `sz` is incremented by 1, maintaining the condition `k <= sz < n` and `sz` being equal to `sz_prev + 1`.
