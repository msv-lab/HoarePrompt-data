Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is at least 1023, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`x`, `t`, and `subseq_lens`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
