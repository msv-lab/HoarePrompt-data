Output State: **`ans` contains at least two elements, `temp` includes `(q + r) % n`, and `(q - r) % n`, and `c` is either '1' or '?'.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` originally included `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, adding `(q - r) % n` again does not change its contents. The variable `ans` and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
