Postcondition: `ans` is either the initial value plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` (when `len(lst) != 2`), or twice the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` (when `len(lst) == 2`), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `lst` has a length of 0 or the second element has been removed if the length is not 2.
