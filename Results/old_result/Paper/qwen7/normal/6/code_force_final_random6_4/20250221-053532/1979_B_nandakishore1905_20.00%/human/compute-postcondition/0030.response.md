Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `m` is the second integer entered by the user.
- `k` is the absolute difference between the original `n` and `m`.
- `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- `p` is the length of `l`.
- `q` is 2.
- `i` is `i_end + 1`.
- `k` is updated to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print(2)
```

This statement will print the integer `2` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **2**
