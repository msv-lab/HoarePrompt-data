Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and k > 0`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting each string in the original list `a` to an integer using `map` and `lambda`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `ans` is 0.

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `l < r` and `k > 0`.
   - Currently, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. For `l < r` to be true, `n` must be greater than 0 (since `r = n - 1`).
   - `k` must be greater than 0 for the second part of the condition to be true.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0 to satisfy `l < r`.
   - `k` must be greater than 0 to satisfy `k > 0`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0 and `k` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
