Output State: **`sz` is 4, `sng` is a fully iterated iterable, `elem` is the next element of `rdb`, `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, and the value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to -2.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` was either 2 or 0. After executing `sz += 2`, `sz` becomes 4. The other variables (`sng`, `elem`, `rdb`) remain unchanged, and the condition `k - sz` being greater than or equal to 0 changes to `k - sz` being greater than or equal to -2 because `sz` increased by 2.
