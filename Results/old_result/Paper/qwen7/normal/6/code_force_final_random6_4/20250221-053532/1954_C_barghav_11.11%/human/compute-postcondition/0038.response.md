Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over the indices of the list `a`. The variable `i` takes values from `0` to `len(a) - 1`.
3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts from the beginning and iterates through all elements of `a`, `i` should start from `0` before the loop begins.
4. **Determine the initial state of `len(a)`**: The length of `a` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `i` should start from `0` and `len(a)` should be at least `1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment

1. **Initial State of `i`**: `i` should start from `0`.
2. **Initial State of `len(a)`**: `len(a)` must be at least `1`.

### Final State

The states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(a)`.

**State:**
- `i` is `0`
- `len(a)` must be at least `1`

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`i` is `0`, `len(a)` must be at least `1`**.
