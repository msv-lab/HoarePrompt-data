Output State: **`d` is `n-1`; `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` was called with the argument `d`, which is `n-1`. The function returned two values, which were assigned to `v` and `u` respectively. The initial value of `d` remains `n-1`.
