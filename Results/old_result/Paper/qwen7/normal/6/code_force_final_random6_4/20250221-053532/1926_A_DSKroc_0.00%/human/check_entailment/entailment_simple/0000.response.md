### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes two counters, `ac` and `bc`, to zero. These counters are used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' respectively.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B'.

3. **Counting Characters**: The program iterates through each character in the string `s` and increments the appropriate counter (`ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B').

4. **Output Determination**: After counting the characters, the program compares the counts `ac` and `bc`. It prints 'A' if `ac` is greater than `bc`, and 'B' otherwise.

5. **Loop Execution**: The loop correctly iterates over all test cases, ensuring that each string is processed exactly once.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases where the input string can be composed of any combination of 'A' and 'B', including cases where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal.

Given the above points, the program logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

### Correctness:
**True**
