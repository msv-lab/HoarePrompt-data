Output State: **`ans` contains all elements it was initialized with, `temp` is equal to `ans`, and `c` is either '1' or '?' for all iterations.**

Explanation: The line `ans = temp` assigns the current value of `temp` to `ans`. This means that `ans` now holds the same set of elements as `temp` did before the assignment. The value of `c` remains unchanged, so it is still either '1' or '?' for all iterations.
