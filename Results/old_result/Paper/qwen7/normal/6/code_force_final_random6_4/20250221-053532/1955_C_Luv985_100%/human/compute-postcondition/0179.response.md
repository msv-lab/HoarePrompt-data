Output State: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` is `k - 2 * min(a[0], a[n-1])`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, and the current value of `l` is 0**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was 0, so now it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
