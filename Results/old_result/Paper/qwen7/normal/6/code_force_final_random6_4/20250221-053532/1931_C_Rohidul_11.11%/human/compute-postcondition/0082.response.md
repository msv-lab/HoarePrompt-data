Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a new list of integers, `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is 0, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is False, `end` is `n - 1, `ans` is determined based on the conditions above, `n` is updated to an integer input.**

The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to an integer input from the user, while the other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
