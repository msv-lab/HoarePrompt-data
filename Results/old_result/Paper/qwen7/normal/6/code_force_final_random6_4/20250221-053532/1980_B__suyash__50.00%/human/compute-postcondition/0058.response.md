Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `l`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range of the length of the list `l`.

3. **Determine the Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `fav` is an integer.
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`.
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `k` is decreased by either the value at index `i_end + 1` of list `l` or by `dic[l[i_end + 1]]` if `fav` equals `l[i_end + 1]`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `i_end + 1` and the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i_end + 2`.
   - The list `l` remains unchanged.
   - The variable `k` could be further decreased based on the condition inside the loop, but since we don't know the exact condition, we keep it as `k` being decreased by either `l[i_end + 1]` or `dic[l[i_end + 1]]` if `fav` equals `l[i_end + 1]`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be `i_end + 2`.
   - `l` remains the same.
   - `k` remains the same (decreased by either `l[i_end + 1]` or `dic[l[i_end + 1]]`).

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`fav` is an integer, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `l` is a list of integers, and `k` is decreased by either the value at index `i_end + 1` of list `l` or by `dic[l[i_end + 1]]` if `fav` equals `l[i_end + 1]`.**
