Output State: `t` is 9999, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the maximum value of `i` that the loop iterated through, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for the last iteration, and `suma` is the total sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop's iterations, including any additional increments based on the specified conditions.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `t` reaches its maximum possible value of 9999), the variable `t` will be 9999. The variable `a` retains its initial value since it is not modified within the loop. The variable `b` will be the highest value of `i` used in the loop, which is `T`. The variable `i` will be `b + 1`, which is `T + 1`. The variable `x` will be the value calculated for the last iteration of the loop, and `suma` will be the cumulative sum of all `x` values that satisfy the conditions within the loop's iterations.
