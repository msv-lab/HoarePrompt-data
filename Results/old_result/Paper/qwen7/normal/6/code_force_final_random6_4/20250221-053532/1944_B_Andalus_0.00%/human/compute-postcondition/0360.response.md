Output State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `ldb` or `sz`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the program would exit the current loop or conditional structure.
