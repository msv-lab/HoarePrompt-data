Postcondition: `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + 1`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is 2, and `hd` is now `hd - 2`. If the current characters `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are '1' and '0' respectively, `hd` decreases by 2 and `res` becomes the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + 1`.
