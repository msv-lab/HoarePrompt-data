Output State: **`i` is 2, `ls` is the original value of `ls` plus `nums[1]` plus `nums[2]`, `nums[1]` is 0, `nums[2]` is decreased by `ls`.**

Explanation: The code `ls += nums[i]` increments `ls` by the value of `nums[i]`, which is `nums[2]`. Given that `i` is 2, `ls` is updated to its original value plus `nums[1]` (which is 0) plus `nums[2]`. Also, `nums[2]` is decreased by `ls`. All other variables remain unchanged.
