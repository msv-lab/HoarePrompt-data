Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` takes an input in the format of hours and minutes separated by a colon (e.g., "9:30") and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `h` and `m`. The variables `t`, `day`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
