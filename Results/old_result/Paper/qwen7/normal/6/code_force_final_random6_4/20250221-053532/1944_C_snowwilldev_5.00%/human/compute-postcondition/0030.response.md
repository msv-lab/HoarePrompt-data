Based on the initial state provided, we know that:

- `i` is set to `N-1`.
- `t` is either incremented by 1 (`t + 1`) if `cnt[i] == 1`, or remains unchanged if `cnt[i] != 1`.

However, the value of `i` is explicitly stated to be `N-1`, and this value will be printed directly by the `print(i)` statement.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `i`, which is `N-1`.

Output: **N-1**
