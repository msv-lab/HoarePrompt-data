Output State: **`temp` contains an additional element which is `(q + r) % n`, `c` is equal to '0' or '?', `ans` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The code adds an element to the set `temp`. The element added is the result of `(q + r) % n`. The other variables `c` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
