Output State: **`lst[x]' is a list with one less element, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]' before popping.** 

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. Since `lst[x]` was initially a list with one element, after popping, it will have one less element. The value of `y` is the element that was popped from the list.
