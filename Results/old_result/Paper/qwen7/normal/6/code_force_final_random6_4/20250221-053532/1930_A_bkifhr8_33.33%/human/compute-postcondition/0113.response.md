Output State: **`ans_f` must be an empty list.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans_f` will eventually become an empty list because the loop continues to reduce the size of `lst` until it contains fewer than 2 elements. Since the loop stops when `lst` has less than 2 elements, `ans_f` will no longer accumulate any new elements and will end up being an empty list.
