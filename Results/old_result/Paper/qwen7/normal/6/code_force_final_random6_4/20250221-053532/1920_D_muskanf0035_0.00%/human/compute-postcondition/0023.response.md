Output State: **`array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations, `result` is a list with one additional element which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, `operations` is a list containing at least one tuple, and `k` is the second element of `queries`, and `result` has an additional element appended which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` to the `result` list. The `array`, `result`, `operations`, and `k` variables retain their previous states except that `result` now includes the new element.
