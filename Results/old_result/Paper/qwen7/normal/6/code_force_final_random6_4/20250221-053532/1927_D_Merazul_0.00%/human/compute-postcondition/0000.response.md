Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; a new lambda function `R` is defined which maps input strings to a tuple of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that takes input from the user and splits it into a tuple of integers. However, no actual input is taken or processed in this snippet, so the values of the variables remain unchanged. The lambda function `R` is now available to be used later in the program.
