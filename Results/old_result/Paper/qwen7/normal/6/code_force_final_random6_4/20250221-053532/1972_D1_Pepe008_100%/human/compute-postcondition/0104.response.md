Output State: `t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the final value it reached after the loop, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `suma` is the sum of all `x` values that satisfy the conditions within the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains 2, `a` retains its initial value, `b` is the highest value it reached during the loop's execution, `i` is one more than the final value of `b`, `x` is calculated based on the last iteration's values, and `suma` is the cumulative sum of all valid `x` values that met the specified conditions throughout the loop's iterations.
