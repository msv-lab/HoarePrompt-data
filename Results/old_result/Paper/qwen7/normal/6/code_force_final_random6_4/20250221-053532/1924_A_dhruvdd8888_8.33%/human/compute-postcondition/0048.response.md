Output State: **`us` is an empty set, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: Given the conditions and the provided loop, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters in `us` that are not already in `win`. However, since the loop processes each character in `us` exactly once and appends it to `ans` and `win` when it meets the condition (`i not in win`), and given that the loop executes until `ps` (which counts the number of times `win` reaches size `k`) equals `n`, after all iterations, `us` will be exhausted. Since `us` initially contains characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, and assuming the loop fully processes all these characters, `us` will become empty. Additionally, `win` will contain all characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet exactly once, and `ans` will contain all these characters as well. The variable `ps` will be equal to `n`, but since the problem specifies that `ps` is less than `n` before the loop starts, and considering the loop's termination condition, `ps` will end up being 0 after all iterations, as the loop does not append to `ans` or increment `ps` beyond the required count `n`.
