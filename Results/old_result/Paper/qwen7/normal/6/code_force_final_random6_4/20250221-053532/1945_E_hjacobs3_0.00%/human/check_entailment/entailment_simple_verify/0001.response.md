Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange the permutation array with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at position `l`.
2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly in the `func_1` function. It narrows down the search range until it finds the target value or determines it's not present.
3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The current implementation only checks if `array[l]` is not equal to `x` and swaps if necessary.
   - It does not consider the possibility that `array[r+1]` might also need to be swapped to ensure `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Let's analyze the annotated code step-by-step:

- **Initial State**: The array is a permutation of length `n`, and `l` and `r` are initialized to `0` and `n-1` respectively.
- **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues until `l` is no longer less than or equal to `r`. Inside the loop, `mid` is calculated as the floor of `(l + r) / 2`. Depending on the value of `array[mid]`, `l` or `r` is updated.
- **Post-loop State**: After the loop, `l` is set to the next integer greater than `r`, making `l` equal to `0` and `r` equal to `-1`.
- **Check and Swap Logic**: The code checks if `array[l]` is not equal to `x`. If true, it prints `1` and returns the indices `[l + 1, array.index(find) + 1]`. This ensures that `array[l]` is swapped with the correct position of `x` if necessary.
- **No Second Swap Consideration**: The code does not check if `array[r + 1]` is not equal to `x` and perform a second swap. This means the solution might not always work if `array[r + 1]` needs to be swapped to ensure `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Given the problem constraints and the need to perform at most 2 swaps, the current implementation is incomplete. It only handles one possible swap scenario and may miss the second required swap.

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the binary search will find the target value `x` at position `l` with at most 2 swaps. The logic in `func_1` needs to be revised to handle both potential swap scenarios.
