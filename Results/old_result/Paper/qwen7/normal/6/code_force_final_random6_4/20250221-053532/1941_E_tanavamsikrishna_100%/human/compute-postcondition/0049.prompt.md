You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: Output State: `row` is a list of integers with its first element being 1, and each subsequent element being the original second element plus 2 times its index (starting from 0), `i` is equal to `d`, `d` must be greater than 2, and the length of `row` is `d`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `row` list will have `d` elements. The first element remains 1, and each subsequent element starting from the second one will be calculated as the original value of the second element plus 2 times its index position. For example, if `d` was 5, the `row` list would look like this: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` assuming the original second element was 1.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: After all iterations, the loop terminates when `i` is greater than or equal to `len(row)`. The `min_heap` contains pairs of updated values from `row` and their respective indices. Each element in `row` has been updated according to the rule: `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`, where `e[0]` is the value popped from `min_heap`. The `row` list is now fully updated based on the operations performed within the loop.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the updated `row` list, which is the result of applying the update rule `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` for each element in `row`, where `e[0]` is the value popped from the `min_heap`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `row`, a list of integers representing the depths of river cells, and `d`, a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports. The function applies an update rule to each element in `row`, where each element is incremented by the value popped from a `min_heap` and then 1. Finally, the function returns the last element of the updated `row` list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the updated `row` list, which is the result of applying the update rule `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` for each element in `row`, where `e[0]` is the value popped from the `min_heap`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
