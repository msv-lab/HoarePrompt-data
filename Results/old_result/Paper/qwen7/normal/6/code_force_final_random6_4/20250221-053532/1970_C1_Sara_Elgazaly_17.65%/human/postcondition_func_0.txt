The function reads two integers from input, constructs an undirected graph using adjacency lists, and then traverses the graph starting from the first integer. It alternates between two states (True and False) until it reaches a leaf node (a node with no outgoing edges). Finally, it prints 'Ron' if the last state is True, otherwise it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not accept any parameters and relies on external input constraints.
