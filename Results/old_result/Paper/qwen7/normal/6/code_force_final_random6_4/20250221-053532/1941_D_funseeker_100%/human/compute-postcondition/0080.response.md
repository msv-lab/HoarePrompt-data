Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty set with at least two elements, `q` is the second element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()` and its value is either '1', '?', or '0'.**

Explanation: The code adds the expression `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` initially contained the element `(q + r) % n`, after executing the line `temp.add((q - r) % n)`, `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
