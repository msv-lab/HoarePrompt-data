You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) followed by a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If so, it rearranges `s` by moving the second half to the front and prints the result. If the rearranged string is not a palindrome, it prints the rearranged string; otherwise, it prints the reverse of the original string. If the string `s` contains one or zero unique characters, it prints 'NO'. The function ultimately outputs information about each test case based on the conditions described.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the string consists of only one unique character correctly. For example, in the input "hhhhhhhhhh", the program incorrectly outputs "NO", which is not in accordance with the problem description. According to the problem description, if no such string \( r \) exists, we should output "NO". However, since the string consists of only one unique character, it is impossible to rearrange it to form a different string, so the correct output should be "NO". The program fails to recognize this scenario, leading to incorrect results.
