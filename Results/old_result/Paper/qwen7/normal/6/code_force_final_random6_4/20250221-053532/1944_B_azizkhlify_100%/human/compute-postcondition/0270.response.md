Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number input, `k` is an integer equal to the second number input, `a` is a list of integers equal to the numbers input after the two integers separated by spaces, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `r` with `n` zeros. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, or `l`. The list `r` is created with `n` elements, each set to 0.
