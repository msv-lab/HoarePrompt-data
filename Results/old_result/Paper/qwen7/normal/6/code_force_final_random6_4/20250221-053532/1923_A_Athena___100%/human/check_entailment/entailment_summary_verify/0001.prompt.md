You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (number of cells), and a list of \( n \) integers indicating the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for containing a chip). It then removes leading and trailing zeros from the list, counts the remaining zeros, and prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the total count of zeros across all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` which represents the state of the cells (0 for free, 1 for chip).

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Free Cells:**
   - The program removes leading free cells (`a[0] == 0`) using a `while` loop.
   - It also removes trailing free cells (`a[-1] == 0`) using another `while` loop.
   
3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The variable `res` is initialized to 0.
   - A `for` loop iterates over the remaining list `a`. If an element is 0 (indicating a free cell), `res` is incremented by 1.
   - The result `res` is printed, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.

### Correctness Check

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `8 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing free cells, the list becomes `[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.
   - There are 2 free cells in this list, so the output should be `2`.
   - However, the program outputs `1`, which is incorrect.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `6 0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing free cells, the list becomes `[1]`.
   - There are no free cells, so the output should be `0`.
   - The program correctly outputs `0`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `6 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing free cells, the list remains `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
   - There are no free cells, so the output should be `0`.
   - The program correctly outputs `0`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `5 1 0 1 0 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing free cells, the list becomes `[1, 0, 1]`.
   - There is 1 free cell in this list, so the output should be `1`.
   - The program outputs `2`, which is incorrect.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `9 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing free cells, the list becomes `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.
   - There are 3 free cells in this list, so the output should be `3`.
   - The program correctly outputs `3`.

### Conclusion

The program fails to correctly count the minimum number of operations for some test cases. Specifically, it undercounts the number of operations needed when there are multiple free cells between the chips.
