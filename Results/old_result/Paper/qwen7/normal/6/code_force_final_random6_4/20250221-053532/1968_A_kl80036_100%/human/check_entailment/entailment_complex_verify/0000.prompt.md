You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed for all input cases, meaning `i` is now equal to the total number of inputs provided. For each iteration, `x` was an input integer, and `y` was calculated as `x - 1`. After all iterations, `i` will be the sum of all inputs minus the number of inputs (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each input). `x` will hold the value of the last input provided, and `y` will be the last input value minus one.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `i` will be the total number of inputs, `x` will be the last input integer provided, and `y` will be `x - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of integer inputs. It reads an integer `t` which represents the number of subsequent integer inputs. For each of these `t` inputs, it calculates and prints the value of the input integer decreased by one. After processing all inputs, the function does not return any value but ensures that for each input `x`, the value `x - 1` is printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \le y < x\). Instead, it simply prints \(x - 1\) for each test case, which does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

For example, consider the input \(x = 10\):
- The program outputs \(y = 9\).
- However, \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
- A better choice would be \(y = 5\), since \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).

Thus, the program does not always find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), making it incorrect.
