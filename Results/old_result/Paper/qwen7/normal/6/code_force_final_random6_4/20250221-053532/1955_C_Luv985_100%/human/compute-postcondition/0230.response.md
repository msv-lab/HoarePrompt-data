Output State: **Postcondition: `k` must be greater than 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2; `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, it does not modify any variable values but rather breaks out of the loop or case. Therefore, the values of `k`, `mi`, `t`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
