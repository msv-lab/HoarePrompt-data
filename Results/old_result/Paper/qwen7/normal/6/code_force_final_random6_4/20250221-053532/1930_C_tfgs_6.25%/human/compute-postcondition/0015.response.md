Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(len(a)):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `i` is initialized as `n - cnt`.
   - `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order.
   - `counter` is a dictionary counting the occurrences of each element in the updated list `a`.
   - `cnt` is `n - len(a)`.
   - `ans` is an empty list.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   The loop will run as long as `i < len(a)`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i` is less than the length of the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(a)` for the loop to execute.
   - Since `i` is initialized as `n - cnt`, we need to ensure that `n - cnt` is less than `len(a)`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(a)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n - cnt`, `len(a)` must be greater than `n - cnt`**
