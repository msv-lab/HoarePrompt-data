Output State: **`i` is 10, `x` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10 three times, and `mx` is 10; `ansv` is a list containing 10 ten times.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ansv` as a list containing the integer 10 repeated 10 times. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `x`, `t`, `subseq_lens`, or `mx`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values. The final state includes the new list `ansv` which contains 10 repeated 10 times.
