Output State: **`remaining_vertices` must not be empty, `d` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is the result of `func_1(0)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(0)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` was called with the argument `d` which is `0`, and it returned two values, which were assigned to `v` and `u`. The values of `remaining_vertices` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
