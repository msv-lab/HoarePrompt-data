Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `n` and `1`, `cnt` is `2`, `t` is decreased by `1`, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `1`, and `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially either `1` or `0`, after this operation, `cnt` will be `2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
