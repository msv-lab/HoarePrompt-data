Output State: **`ans` is the initial value plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `lst` has a length of 0, the first element of `lst` does not exist.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `1 * 2`, which is index 2 (since list indexing starts at 0), from the list `lst`. Given that `lst` initially has only one element, removing the element at index 2 results in an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.
