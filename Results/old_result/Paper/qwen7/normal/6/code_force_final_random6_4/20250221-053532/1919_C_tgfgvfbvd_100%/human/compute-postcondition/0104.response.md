Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and then converts each element to an integer. The resulting list of integers is stored in `l`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was just an input integer in the initial state.
