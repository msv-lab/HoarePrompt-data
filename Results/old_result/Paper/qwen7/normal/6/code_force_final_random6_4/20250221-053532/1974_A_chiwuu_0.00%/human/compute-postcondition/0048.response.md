Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - `t` is `b * 2`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t` is increased by:
     - `t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`.
     - `t2 // 15 + 1` otherwise.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the possible scenarios:

- Since `t` is initially `b * 2`, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, we need to consider the relationship between `t1` and `a`.

### Scenario Analysis:
1. **Case 1: `t1 >= a`**
   - In this case, `t` remains unchanged.
   - Therefore, `t = b * 2`.

2. **Case 2: `t1 < a`**
   - Here, `t2 = a - t1`.
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` increases by `t2 // 15`.
   - If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then `t` increases by `t2 // 15 + 1`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `t1` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `t`. However, based on the given conditions, we know that `t` will either remain `b * 2` or increase by some integer value depending on the value of `t2`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `t` after the operations will be either `b * 2` or `b * 2 + k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer determined by the conditions described.

Output: **b * 2 + k (where k is 0 or a non-negative integer determined by the conditions)**
