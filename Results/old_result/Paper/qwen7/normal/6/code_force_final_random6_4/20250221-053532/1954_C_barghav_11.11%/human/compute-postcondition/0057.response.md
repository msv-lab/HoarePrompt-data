Functionality: **The function takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads two strings of digits from 1 to 9, swaps the smaller digit with the larger one for the first half of the string while maintaining their order, and for the second half, it does the opposite. After processing, it prints the modified strings `a` and `b`.**
