Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `q` is an input integer.
- `queries` is a list of integers formed by splitting and converting an input string using the `map` function.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the `result` list, separated by spaces.

However, since the exact value of `result` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the inputs and the function call.

Output: **the return value of func_1(n, operations, queries) (where operations and queries are derived from the input string and n is the input integer)**
