Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is 0, `sng` is an iterable that has been fully iterated over, and `elem` is the last element of `sng`.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `sz` is either 2 or 0, `sng` is a fully iterated iterable, `elem` is the last element of `sng`, `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, and the value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `sz` is either 2 or 0, `sng` is a fully iterated iterable, `elem` is the next element of `rdb`, `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, and the value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is 4. Otherwise, the condition remains as stated in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `sz` is either 2 or 4 (depending on the value of `k`), `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, `elem` is the next element of `rdb`, and if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
