Output State: **The loop will have executed `n * 2` times, `i` will be equal to `n * 2`, `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` for each iteration where the length of `lst` is not 2, and `ans_f` will contain the final value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. Since the loop has already executed `n * 2` times and `i` is equal to `n * 2`, the loop condition has been satisfied. The value of `ans` remains unchanged from its last computed value within the loop, and it is appended to `ans_f`. The conditions for the loop and the values of `i` and `ans` remain as they were before the append operation.
