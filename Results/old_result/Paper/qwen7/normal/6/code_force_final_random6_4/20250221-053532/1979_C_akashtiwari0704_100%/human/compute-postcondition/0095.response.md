Functionality: **The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` and calculates the product of all elements in `l`. It then divides this product by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of this product and each element in `l` for all valid indices. The function returns the final value of `g`, which represents this calculation. After the function concludes, `i` is set to the length of the list `l`.**
