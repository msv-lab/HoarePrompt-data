Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `line`. The loop iterates over every second line starting from the third line of the input file.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are lines available to read according to the specified pattern (`[*open(0)][2::2]`). This means the loop reads every second line starting from the third line.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`.
   - `line` is the next line of input.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop reads every second line starting from the third line, the `line` variable will be updated to the next line that matches the pattern.
   - Therefore, `line` will be the next line of input that fits the specified pattern.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `t` remains the same: \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` remains the same: a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`.
- `line` is updated to the next line of input that fits the pattern.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`, `line` is the next line of input that fits the pattern.**

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`, `line` is the next line of input that fits the pattern.**
