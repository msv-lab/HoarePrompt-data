Output State: **`res` is `[1] * n` if `k` equals `n`, otherwise `res` is `range(n)` if `k` equals `1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^3 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split.**

The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `res` and `t` remain unchanged according to the conditions specified in the initial state. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input.
