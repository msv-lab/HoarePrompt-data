Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `r = mid - 1` updates the value of `r` to be `mid - 1`. The other variables (`array`, `l`, `mid`) remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `r`.
