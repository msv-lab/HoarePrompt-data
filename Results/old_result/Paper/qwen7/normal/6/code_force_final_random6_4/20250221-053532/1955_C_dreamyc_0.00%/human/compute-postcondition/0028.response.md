Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-1 integers (excluding the first and last elements). If `b > 0` and `a > 0`, then `nums` is updated to append the value of `a` to the left end of the deque, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * b`, and both `a` and `b` are updated to `a - b` and `b - b` respectively. If `b > 0` and `a <= 0`, or if `b <= 0`, then `ans` is set to 1, and no changes are made to `k`, `a`, `b`, or `nums`.
