Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list containing `n+1` elements, and the last element of `numbers` is now `n`.**

Explanation: The code `numbers.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the end of the list `numbers`. Since `numbers` originally contained `n+1` elements and the last element was `n`, after appending `n` again, the last element of `numbers` becomes `n`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
