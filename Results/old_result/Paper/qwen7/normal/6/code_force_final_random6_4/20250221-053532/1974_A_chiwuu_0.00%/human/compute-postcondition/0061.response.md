Output State: **`t1` is `a - (b * 2) * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer converted from the first input split from `input().split()`, `b` is the second input split from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is `t + t2 // 15`**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated by adding `t2 // 15` to its current value. Since `t2` is defined as `a - t1`, the updated value of `t` is the original value of `t` plus `(a - t1) // 15`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
