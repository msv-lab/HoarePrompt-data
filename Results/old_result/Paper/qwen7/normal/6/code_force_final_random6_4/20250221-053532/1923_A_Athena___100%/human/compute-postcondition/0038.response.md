Output State: **`res` is a non-negative integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The variables `res` and `_` remain unchanged, and `n` remains as an input integer.
