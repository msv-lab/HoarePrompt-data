Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arr:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 20.
   - `arr` is a list containing `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the list `arr`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be an element of the list `arr`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to 20, and 20 is not in the list `arr`, the loop will not execute as written.
   - To make the loop execute, `i` must be one of the elements in `arr`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` becomes one of the elements in `arr`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` must be one of the elements in `arr`, `c` is 0**
