Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCasos`) and processes each test case individually. This is correct.

2. **Variable Initialization and Types**:
   - `pergunta` is initialized as `float('inf')`, which is appropriate for finding the minimum value.
   - `a` and `b` are correctly read as lists of integers.
   - `n` and `m` are correctly read as integers.
   
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates backward through the list `a` (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - It updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]` when `i < m`.
   - It accumulates the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` into `x`.
   - After the loop, `pergunta` holds the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the final value of `pergunta`, which is the minimum cost required for Kirill to achieve his goal.

5. **State Analysis**:
   - The state before the function call is correctly described.
   - The state after the function call matches the expected behavior: `i` is `-1`, `pergunta` contains the minimum cost, and other variables retain their original values.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people in the queue.

Correctness: **True**
