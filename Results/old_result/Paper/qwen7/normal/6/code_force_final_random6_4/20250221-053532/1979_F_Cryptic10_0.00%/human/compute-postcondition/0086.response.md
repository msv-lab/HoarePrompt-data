Output State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`, `d` is `-1`, `n` is still greater than `0`, and `path` now includes the value of `v`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(d)` and `d` is `-1`, `v` retains the value it was given. The other variables (`remaining_vertices`, `d`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
