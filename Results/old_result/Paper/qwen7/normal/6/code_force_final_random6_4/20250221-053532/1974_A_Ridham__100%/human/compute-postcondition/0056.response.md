Output State: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * (`y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1) - `space_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4 * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `x` is updated to the first integer from the input, `y` is updated to the second integer from the input, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 * 4 + x * 1`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `extra_space` which is defined as `space_x - remaining_cells`. Since `space_x` is `x * 1` and `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 or y // 2 + 1) - space_y`, `extra_space` is calculated using these values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
