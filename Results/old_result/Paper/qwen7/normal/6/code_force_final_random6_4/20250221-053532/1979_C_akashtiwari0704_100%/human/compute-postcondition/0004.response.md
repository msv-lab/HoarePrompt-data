State: **`t` is 0, `g` is 1, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
- The condition for the loop to execute is that `len(l)` must be at least 1, meaning the list `l` must have at least one element.
- The initial value of `i` is set to 0 because the loop starts with the first element of the list.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the list `l` must have at least one element, and the initial state of `i` should be 0.
