Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string from the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is equal to the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `z` to be the number of occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
