### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly initializes variables and reads the necessary inputs.
   - It uses a sliding window approach to track the presence of all `k` characters in the string `s`.
   - The variable `win` keeps track of the current window of characters seen in `s` that are part of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - The variable `ans` collects characters that form a valid sequence when `win` reaches the size of `k`.

2. **Logic for Checking Subsequences**:
   - The function iterates through the string `s` and checks if each character is part of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - When `win` reaches the size of `k`, it appends the character to `ans` and resets `win`.
   - After processing the entire string, if `ps` (the count of times `win` reached the size of `k`) is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `ps` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that includes a character from `us` (the set of first `k` lowercase English alphabets) that is not present in `win`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the string `s` might not contain enough characters to form all possible sequences of length `n` from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - The construction of the output string in the `NO` case ensures that it includes a character from `us` that is not present in `win`.

4. **Input and Output Validation**:
   - The function correctly validates the inputs and outputs according to the problem statement.
   - It ensures that the output format is correct, printing 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the required string in the `NO` case.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
