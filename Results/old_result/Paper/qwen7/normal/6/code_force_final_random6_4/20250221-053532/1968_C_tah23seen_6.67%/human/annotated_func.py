#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n. The variable n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be -1, and `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` will be the final value of `ans` which is the maximum possible value that can be achieved by doubling the values according to the given conditions.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of `ans[length_of_arr - 1]`, which is `ans[length_of_arr - 2] + arr[length_of_arr - 1]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` containing `n-1` integers (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive) and an integer `n`. It calculates a new list `ans` where each element is derived based on the previous elements and the corresponding elements in `arr`. Specifically, it starts by setting `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`, then iteratively computes each subsequent element in `ans` by adding the current element in `arr` to the previous element in `ans`, and adjusting the value if necessary to ensure it is greater than the corresponding element in `arr`. Finally, it returns the last element of `ans`, which is the sum of the second last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.
