Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is a string; `k` is a string**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts, assigning the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k`, but we know they are strings resulting from splitting the input. The value of `T` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
