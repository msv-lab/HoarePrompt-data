Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, and `max` is the second largest value among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`. Since the if condition `n == 2` does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `max`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
