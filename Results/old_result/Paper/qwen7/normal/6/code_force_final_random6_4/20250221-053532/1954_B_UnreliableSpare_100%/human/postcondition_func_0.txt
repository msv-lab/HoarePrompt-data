The function processes an input array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5) to determine if it is beautiful. If the array is not constant (i.e., not all elements are the same), it finds and prints the minimum consecutive segment length where the elements are the same. If the array is constant, it prints -1.
