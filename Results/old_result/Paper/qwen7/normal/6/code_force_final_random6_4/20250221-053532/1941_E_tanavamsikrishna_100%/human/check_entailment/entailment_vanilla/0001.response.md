Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
This function aims to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row of the river such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the first support cost to 1.
   - For the next `d-1` positions, add 2 to the cost because the distance between the first support and these positions is 1, and we need to add an additional support at each position.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - Create a min-heap with the initial costs and their indices.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - For each subsequent position `i` from `d` to the end of the row:
     - Remove the smallest cost from the heap until the index is greater than `i - (d + 2)`. This ensures that the distance between the current position and the last support in the heap is at least `d`.
     - Calculate the new cost for the current position `i` and push it into the heap.
     - Push the updated cost back into the heap.

4. **Return the Last Cost**:
   - The last element in the row will be the minimum cost for the entire row.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function calculates the total minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - Read the depth values for each row.

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Row**:
   - Use `func_1` to compute the minimum cost for each row.

3. **Calculate Total Costs for Consecutive Rows**:
   - Compute the sum of costs for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Find Minimum Total Cost**:
   - Find the minimum sum among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Verification

1. **Heap Usage**:
   - The use of a min-heap is correct for maintaining the minimum cost within the required distance constraint.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The logic for updating costs and maintaining the heap is sound and correctly implements the constraints.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input parsing and output printing are handled correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the row length might be less than `d` or when `k` is 1.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly according to the problem statement. The logic for calculating the minimum cost of placing supports in each row and then finding the minimum cost for consecutive rows is sound.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
