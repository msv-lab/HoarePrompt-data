Postcondition: `i` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is increased by `dif` if `i` is 3, `k` is 0 if `i` is 2, `res` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 3, and `res` is decreased by 1 regardless of the value of `i`. Additionally, if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` becomes `-dif * 3`, `res` decreases by 3, and `ans` increases by `dif`. Otherwise, `ans` increases by `k // (i + 1)` if `i` is 3, `res` decreases by 2 and then increases by `k % (i + 1)`, and `k` is reset to 0.
