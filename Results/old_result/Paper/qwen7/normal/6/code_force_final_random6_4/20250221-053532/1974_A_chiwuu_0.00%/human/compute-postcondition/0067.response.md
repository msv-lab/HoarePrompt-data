Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`
   - `n > 0`
   - `i = 2`
   - `a` is an integer converted from the first input split from `input().split()`
   - `b` is the second input split from `input().split()` converted to an integer
   - `t = b * 2`

2. **Conditions and Operations:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t1` is updated to `a - (b * 2) * 15 - b * 4`, and `t` is adjusted based on the new value of `t1`:
     - If `(a - t1) % 15 == 0`, then `t` is incremented by `(a - t1) // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `t` is incremented by `(a - t1) // 15 + 1`.

3. **Determine the Value of `t`:**
   - We need to determine the value of `t` after the conditions and operations are applied.
   - Since `t` is initially set to `b * 2`, we need to check the conditions to see if it changes.

Let's assume specific values for `a` and `b` to illustrate the process. For simplicity, let's assume:
- `a = 100`
- `b = 5`

Given these values:
- `t = b * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10`
- `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 10 * 15 - 5 * 4 = 150 - 20 = 130`

Since `t1 = 130` and `a = 100`, `t1 >= a` is false. Therefore, `t1` is updated to `a - (b * 2) * 15 - b * 4`:
- `t1 = 100 - (5 * 2) * 15 - 5 * 4 = 100 - 10 * 15 - 20 = 100 - 150 - 20 = -70`

Now, we need to adjust `t`:
- `(a - t1) = 100 - (-70) = 170`
- Since `170 % 15 != 0`, `t` is incremented by `(170 // 15) + 1 = 11 + 1 = 12`

So, the final value of `t` is `12`.

Output: **12**
