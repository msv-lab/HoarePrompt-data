Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is less than `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is `cnt + 1`, `cnt` is 1, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value (`n`) and the current value of `cnt` (which is 0 initially). Since `cnt` is incremented before this line, its new value is 1. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `min(n, 1)`, which is `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
