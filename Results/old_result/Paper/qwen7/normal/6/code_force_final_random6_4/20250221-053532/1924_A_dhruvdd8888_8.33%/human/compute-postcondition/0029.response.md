Postcondition: **`win` is a set that contains `i` if `i` was in `us`, `ps` remains 0 if `i` was not in `us`, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing the elements `i` and `i`. If the length of `win` equals `k`, then `ps` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ps` remains 0.**
