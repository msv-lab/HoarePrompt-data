Output State: The loop has executed for all input cases, meaning `i` is equal to the total number of inputs provided. For each iteration, `x` is set to the current input integer, `y` is calculated as `x - 1`, and `y` is printed. The final state will have `i` being the total number of inputs, each corresponding `x` being the last input integer provided, and `y` being the last `x - 1`.

In more detail, if there were `n` total inputs, then `i` would be `n`, `x` would be the last input integer, `y` would be `x - 1`, and `y` would have been printed `n` times.
