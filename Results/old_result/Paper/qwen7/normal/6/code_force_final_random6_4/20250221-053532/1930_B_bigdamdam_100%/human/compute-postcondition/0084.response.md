Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `ind` is set to `2*n - 1`.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `p` is a list that is filled from index 0 to n-1 with values starting from `2*n - 1` and decreasing by 2 for each subsequent index, down to `2*n - 1 - 2*n`.
   - Specifically, `p[i]` (where `i` is `n`) is `2*n - 1`.

2. **Understanding the List `p`:**
   - Since `p` is filled from index 0 to n-1, and it starts from `2*n - 1` and decreases by 2 for each subsequent index, the list `p` will look like this:
     - `p[0] = 2*n - 1`
     - `p[1] = 2*n - 3`
     - `p[2] = 2*n - 5`
     - ...
     - `p[n-1] = 2*n - 1 - 2*(n-1) = 2*n - 1 - 2*n + 2 = 1` (if `n > 0`)

3. **Value of `p[i]` where `i` is `n`:**
   - According to the initial state, `p[i]` (where `i` is `n`) is `2*n - 1`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(*p)` will print the contents of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Given the above, the list `p` will contain values starting from `2*n - 1` and decreasing by 2 until it reaches 1 (or the last valid value if `n` is small enough).

Therefore, the output will be the list `p` printed with space-separated values.

Output: **2*n - 1 2*n - 3 2*n - 5 ... 1**
