Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers formed by the split and mapped input string, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.

Explanation: The code defines the function call `result = func_1(n, operations, queries)`. Here, `n`, `operations`, and `queries` are already defined in the initial state. The function `func_1` is called with these parameters, and its return value is assigned to `result`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, `result` will hold the return value of the function, which could be any value depending on the function's logic. The conditions and values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `queries` remain unchanged from their initial states.
