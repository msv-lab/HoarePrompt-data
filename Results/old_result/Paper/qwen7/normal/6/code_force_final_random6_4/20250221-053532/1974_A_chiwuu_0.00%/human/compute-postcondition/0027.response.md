Postcondition: `t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains unchanged, `t2` is 0, and `t` is updated as follows: if the current value of `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15`; otherwise, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t1` is set to `a - t1`, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is updated as described above, and the conditions remain the same.
