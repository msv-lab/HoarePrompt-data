Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m, with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6 and the total sum of n and m across all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^6. For each test case, it returns either "valid" if both n and m satisfy the given conditions, or "invalid" if any condition is not met.**
