Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must have at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element, and the value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0; if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `E[out_aa]` remains less than or equal to 0, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.
