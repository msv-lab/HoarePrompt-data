Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 5, `g` is \(n / 5 - 1\), `ans` is \(n + (n / 3 - 0) / 3 + 1 + g / count + 2\), `countmins` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += g / count + 1` increments `ans` by the value of `g / count + 1`. From the initial state, we know `g = n / 5 - 1` and `count = 5`. Therefore, `g / count + 1` simplifies to \((n / 5 - 1) / 5 + 1 = n / 25 - 1/5 + 1 = n / 25 + 4/5\). Adding this to the original `ans` gives us `n + (n / 3 - 0) / 3 + 1 + g / count + 2`, which is the updated value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
