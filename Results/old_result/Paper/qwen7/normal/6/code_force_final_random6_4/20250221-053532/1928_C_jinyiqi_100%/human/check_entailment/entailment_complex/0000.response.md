### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the settling pattern described.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), we need to check if there exists a \( k \) such that \( x \) fits into the repeating pattern of the settling.
   - The settling pattern can be broken down into segments of length \( k \) and \( k-2 \).

3. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
   - It uses a function `func_1` to generate all divisors of a number, which helps in determining the possible values of \( k \).
   - The logic in the main part of the program checks if the generated divisors can form valid \( k \) values.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly generates all divisors of a number \( x \) and returns them in a specific order.
   - This is crucial for determining the possible values of \( k \).

5. **Main Logic Analysis:**
   - The main logic correctly checks both cases where \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even, ensuring that the divisors generated by `func_1` are valid \( k \) values.
   - The use of sets to remove duplicates ensures that each valid \( k \) is counted only once.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases correctly, such as when \( n + x - 2 \) or \( n - x \) is not even, by skipping those cases.
   - The constraints \( 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 \) are respected.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values for the given \( n \) and \( x \). The function `func_1` and the main logic work together to ensure that all possible \( k \) values are considered and counted accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
