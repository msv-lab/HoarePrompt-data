Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers formed by the split and mapped input string.**

Explanation: The code `queries = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list called `queries`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `q` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned once in the initial state without being modified.
