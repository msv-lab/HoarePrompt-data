Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b * 2
    if t % 5 == 0:
        t = t // 5
    else:
        t = t // 5 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t1` remains unchanged and `t` is updated according to the specified rules. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t1` is set to `a - t1`, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t` is updated based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15 or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t` is increased by `t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, or by `t2 // 15 + 1` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer converted from the first input split from `input().split()`, `b` is the second input split from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t1` is updated to `a - (b * 2) * 15 - b * 4`, and `t` is adjusted based on the new value of `t1` such that if `(a - t1) % 15 == 0`, then `t` is incremented by `(a - t1) // 15`; otherwise, `t` is incremented by `(a - t1) // 15 + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
