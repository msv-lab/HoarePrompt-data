Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state of `t` was a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, the same condition applies to `T` after the code execution. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are still positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
