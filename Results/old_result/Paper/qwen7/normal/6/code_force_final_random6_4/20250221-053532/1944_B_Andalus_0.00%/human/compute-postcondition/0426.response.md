Postcondition: `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`. If `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k - 2`, it is now exactly `k - 2` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is less than 2, `sz` is updated to `k` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
