Output State: **`i` is `i_initial - 1`, `pergunta` is the minimum between its current value and `x_initial + a[i_initial - 1]`, and `x` is increased by `min(a[i_initial - 1], b[i_initial - 1])` if `i_initial - 1` is within the bounds of the array.**

Explanation: The code updates `pergunta` to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`. Since `i` is `i_initial - 1`, `a[i]` is `a[i_initial - 1]`. The value of `x` is increased by `min(a[i_initial - 1], b[i_initial - 1])` if `i_initial - 1` is within the bounds of the array. The other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
