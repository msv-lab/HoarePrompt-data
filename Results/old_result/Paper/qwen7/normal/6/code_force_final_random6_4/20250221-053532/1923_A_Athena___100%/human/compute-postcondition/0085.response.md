Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `a and a[-1] == 0`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `res` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers with the last element removed.
   - `i` is equal to the new length of `a`.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition checks two things:
     - `a` should not be empty (`a`).
     - The last element of `a` should be 0 (`a[-1] == 0`).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must not be empty and the last element of `a` must be 0.
   - Since `a` is a list, removing elements from it means its length decreases. Therefore, `a` will become empty when `i` (which is the length of `a`) reaches 0.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `i` must be greater than 0 and `a[-1]` must be 0.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - `i` must be greater than 0.
   - `a[-1]` must be 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`res` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `i` must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**
