Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and the current value of `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[r]`. Here, `mi` is defined as the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. After executing this line, the value of `a[r]` is updated to its original value minus `mi`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `mi` remain unchanged.
