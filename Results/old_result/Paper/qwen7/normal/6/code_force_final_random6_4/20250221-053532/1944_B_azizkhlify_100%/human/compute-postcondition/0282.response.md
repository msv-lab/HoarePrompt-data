Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list, `a` is a list such that `a[n-1]` is a valid index within the list `l`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r`. Since `a[n-1]` is a valid index within the list `l`, `a[i]` must be equal to `a[n-1]` (because `i` is `n`). Therefore, the value at index `a[n-1] - 1` in the list `r` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
