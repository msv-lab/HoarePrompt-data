Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ find ≤ n. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two strings: the first string is "1" because `l` is 0 and thus `l + 1` is 1, and the second string is the index in the array where `find` is located, incremented by 1.**
