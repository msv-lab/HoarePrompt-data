Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is -1
- `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` is the sum of all elements in `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[length_of_arr - 1]`

### Loop Head Analysis
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n - 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Key Points to Consider
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is -1. This means the loop has already completed its iterations because it starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 3`.

2. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 2`.

### Adjusting the State
Since `i` is -1, the loop has already completed its iterations. Therefore, there is no need to adjust `i` for the next iteration because the loop is already done.

However, we need to ensure that the condition for the loop to execute one more time is met. Since `i` is -1, the loop will not execute again unless `i` is reset to 0 and `n - 2` is adjusted accordingly.

### Conclusion
Given that the loop has already completed its iterations, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. However, if we were to consider the next hypothetical iteration, `i` would need to be 0, and the condition `i < n - 2` should hold true.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 0, `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` is the sum of all elements in `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[length_of_arr - 1]`**
