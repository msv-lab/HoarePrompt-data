Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, the value of `rgt[1]` is equal to the value of `rgt[0]`, and `rdb` now contains the values `[rgt[0], rgt[0]]`**.

Explanation: The code `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 2, it attempts to append `rgt[2]`. However, since `i` is 2 and `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, and there's no mention of `rgt[2]` being different from `rgt[0]` or `rgt[1]`, we assume `rgt[2]` is also equal to `rgt[0]`. Therefore, `rdb` now contains `[rgt[0], rgt[0]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
