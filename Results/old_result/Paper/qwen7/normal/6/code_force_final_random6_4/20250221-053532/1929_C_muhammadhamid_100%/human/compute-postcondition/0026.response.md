Output State: **`k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 0, `s` is 1**.

The code initializes the variable `s` to 1. This does not affect the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, or `i`. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
