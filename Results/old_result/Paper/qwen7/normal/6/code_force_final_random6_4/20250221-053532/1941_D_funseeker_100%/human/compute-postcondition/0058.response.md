Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains an additional element which is `(q - r) % n`, and `temp` now also contains an additional element which is `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. This does not affect the contents of `ans` or the value of `q`. The value of `temp` is updated to include the new element `(q - r) % n` in addition to the previously mentioned element `(q + r) % n`.
