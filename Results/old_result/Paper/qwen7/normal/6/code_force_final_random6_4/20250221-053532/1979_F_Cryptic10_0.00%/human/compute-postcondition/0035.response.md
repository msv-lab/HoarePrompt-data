Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is `while remaining_vertices:`. This means the loop continues as long as `remaining_vertices` is non-empty.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding all vertices that were added to `path`.
   - `d` is -1.
   - `u` is equal to `func_1(-1)`, which is undefined because the loop condition `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` ensures `d` will never reach -1 within the loop.
   - `v` is the last vertex added to `path` before breaking out of the loop.
   - `path` contains all vertices added during the loop iterations.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `remaining_vertices`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must be non-empty. Since the loop just ended, `remaining_vertices` must have been non-empty at the start of the current iteration.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `remaining_vertices` to ensure it is non-empty for the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set containing integers from 1 to n excluding all vertices that were added to `path`**
