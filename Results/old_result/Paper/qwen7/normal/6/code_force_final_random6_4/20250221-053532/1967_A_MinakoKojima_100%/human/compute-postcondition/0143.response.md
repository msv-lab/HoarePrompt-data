Output State: **`i` is 4, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, `k` is either `-dif * 5` or 0, `res` is either -2 or 0, `ans` is either `ans + (a[5] - a[4])` or 0, and `n` must be greater than 4. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
