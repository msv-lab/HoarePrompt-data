Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is `count - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `count` is decremented by 1, resulting in `countmins` being assigned the value `count - 1`, which is 1 in this case. All other variables remain unchanged.
