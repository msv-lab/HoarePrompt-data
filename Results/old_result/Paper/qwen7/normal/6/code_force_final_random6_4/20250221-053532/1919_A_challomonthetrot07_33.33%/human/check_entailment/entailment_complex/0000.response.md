Reasoning:
The given solution attempts to determine the winner based on certain conditions involving `a` and `b`. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Case when `a == b`:**
   - The solution correctly outputs "Bob". This is because if both players have the same number of coins, Bob will win since Alice starts and she cannot force a win in this scenario.

2. **Case when `a == 1`:**
   - The solution correctly outputs "Alice". If Alice has only one coin, she can immediately lose by removing it, forcing Bob to win.

3. **Case when `b == 1`:**
   - The solution incorrectly outputs "Bob". This condition should actually mean that Alice will win because Bob having only one coin means Alice can remove it on her next turn, forcing Bob to lose.

4. **Case when `a % 2 == 1`:**
   - The solution incorrectly outputs "Bob". This condition should actually mean that Alice will win because if `a` is odd, Alice can always ensure that `a` becomes even after her turn, which forces Bob into a losing position.

5. **Case when `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`:**
   - The solution correctly outputs "Alice". If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice can always ensure that `a` remains even, forcing Bob into a losing position.

6. **Case when `a > b`:**
   - The solution incorrectly outputs "Bob". This condition should actually mean that Bob will win because if `a` is greater than `b`, Bob can always ensure that `b` remains greater than `a` after his turn, forcing Alice into a losing position.

7. **Default case:**
   - The solution correctly outputs "Alice". If none of the above conditions are met, Alice will win because she can always force Bob into a losing position.

Given these observations, the conditions provided in the code do not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the given solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
