Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph with \( n \) vertices where exactly \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete graph. We can query the graph to get information about the degrees of vertices and their connections.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(d)**: This function queries the graph for a vertex \( v \) with a degree of at least \( d \) and an unconnected vertex \( u \). If no such vertex exists, it returns \( 0 \).
   - **func_2(n)**: This function constructs a Hamiltonian path by iteratively querying the graph using `func_1`. It starts from the highest degree and works its way down, ensuring that each queried vertex is added to the path and removed from the set of remaining vertices.

3. **Path Construction Logic**:
   - In `func_2`, the loop iterates from \( n - 1 \) down to 0, querying for vertices with increasing degrees.
   - If a vertex \( v \) with a degree of at least \( d \) is found and it is still in the remaining set, it is added to the path and removed from the set.
   - The process continues until all vertices are included in the path.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly uses the information provided by `func_1` to construct a Hamiltonian path.
   - The path construction ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once, forming a valid Hamiltonian path.
   - The constraints and the nature of the problem guarantee that a Hamiltonian path always exists.

Given the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the solution to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph.

Correctness: **True**
