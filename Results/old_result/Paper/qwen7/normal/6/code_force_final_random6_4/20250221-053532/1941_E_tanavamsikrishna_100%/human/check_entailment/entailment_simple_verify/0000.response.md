### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic for calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by setting the first element of `row` to 1 and then incrementing the next `d-1` elements by 2.
   ```python
   row[0] = 1
   for i in range(1, d):
       row[i] = row[i] + 2
   ```
   This part ensures that the first `d` elements are initialized correctly.

2. **Heap Initialization**: A min-heap is created using the first `d` elements of `row`.
   ```python
   min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
   heapify(min_heap)
   ```

3. **Heap Operations**: The main loop updates the remaining elements of `row` based on the minimum value from the heap.
   ```python
   for i in range(d, len(row)):
       while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
           pass
       row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
       heappush(min_heap, e)
       heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
   ```
   - The loop iterates from `d` to the end of `row`.
   - The `while` loop ensures that only elements whose indices are greater than `i - (d + 2)` are considered.
   - The `heappop` operation retrieves the smallest element from the heap.
   - The cost of installing a support at `row[i]` is calculated as `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
   - The updated value is pushed back into the heap twice to maintain the heap property.

4. **Return Statement**: The function returns the last element of the updated `row`.
   ```python
   return row[-1]
   ```

#### Function `func_2` Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and then parses the river depths for each row.
   ```python
   n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
   rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
   ```

2. **Cost Calculation**: The function calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores the results in the `costs` list.
   ```python
   costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
   ```

3. **Total Cost Calculation**: The function calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and stores these sums in the `total_costs` list.
   ```python
   total_costs = []
   for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
       total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
   ```

4. **Output**: The function prints the minimum total cost from the `total_costs` list.
   ```python
   print(min(total_costs))
   ```

#### Correctness Evaluation

The provided program attempts to find the minimum cost by ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the optimal placement of supports to minimize the total cost.

- **Heap Initialization**: The heap is initialized with the first `d` elements, which is correct.
- **Heap Operations**: The main issue lies in the way the heap is used to update the remaining elements. The current implementation does not guarantee that the supports are placed optimally to minimize the total cost. The `while` loop condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` may not correctly enforce the distance constraint, leading to suboptimal solutions.

Given the example provided in the original assessment, the program incorrectly calculates the cost for the given input, resulting in an incorrect output.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. The `func_1` function does not handle the optimal placement of supports to minimize the total cost, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

**Final: False**
