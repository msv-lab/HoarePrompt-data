Functionality: The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list. This list is formed by combining `output2` and the reversed version of `output1`. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `x`, adding pairs of divisors to `output1` and `output2`. After the loop, it reverses `output1` and concatenates it with `output2` before returning the result.
