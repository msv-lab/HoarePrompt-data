Output State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is `x`**.

Explanation: The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Since `x` is already defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` now includes this value. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
