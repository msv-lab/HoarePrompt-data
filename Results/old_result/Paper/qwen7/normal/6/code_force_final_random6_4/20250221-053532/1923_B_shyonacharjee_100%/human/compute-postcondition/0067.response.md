Based on the initial state provided:

- `can_survive` is `False`.
- `bullets_used` is the sum of the health of all the monsters.
- `monsters` is an empty list because all monsters have been processed.
- `pos` is the position of the last monster.
- `health` is the health of the last monster.
- `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster.

Given the conditions and the fact that the loop breaks on the first iteration due to `can_survive` being `False`, the following will happen:

1. The loop processes the first (and only) monster.
2. `bullets_used` will be set to the health of the last monster.
3. `monsters` will be an empty list since all monsters are processed.
4. `can_survive` remains `False`.

When the `print` statement executes:

```python
print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
```

Since `can_survive` is `False`, the statement will print `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
