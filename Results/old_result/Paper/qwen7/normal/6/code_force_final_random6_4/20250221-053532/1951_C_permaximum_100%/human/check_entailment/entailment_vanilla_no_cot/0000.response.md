Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints. Here's a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Priority Queue Usage**: It uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always consider the cheapest ticket price available at any point in time.
3. **Dynamic Price Adjustment**: The program correctly adjusts the price of tickets after purchasing them, ensuring that the price increases for subsequent days as per the problem statement.
4. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: It calculates the number of tickets to buy each day dynamically and ensures that the total number of tickets purchased equals `k`.
5. **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is calculated accurately by considering the adjusted prices and the number of tickets bought each day.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs as described.
