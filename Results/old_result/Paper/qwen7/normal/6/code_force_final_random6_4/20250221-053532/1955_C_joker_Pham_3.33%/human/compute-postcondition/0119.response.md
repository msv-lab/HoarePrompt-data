Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 2 or `r` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is equal to 7, `a[l]` is decreased by \(2 \times a[r]\), `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[r]\).**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. If `r` was originally `n - 2`, then it is now `n - 3`. Otherwise, it simply decreases by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
