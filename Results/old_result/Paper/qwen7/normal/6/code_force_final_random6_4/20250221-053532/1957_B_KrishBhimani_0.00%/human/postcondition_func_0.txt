The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it constructs a list `ans` based on the binary representation of \( k \). Specifically, it appends powers of 2 to `ans` corresponding to the bits set in \( k \), and pads the list with zeros to match the length \( n \). Finally, it prints the constructed list `ans` for each test case.
