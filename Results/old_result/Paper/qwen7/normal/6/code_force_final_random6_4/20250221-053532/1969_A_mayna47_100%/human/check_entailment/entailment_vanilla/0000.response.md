### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program takes multiple test cases as input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the array `v` where `v[i]` represents the best friend of the `i-th` friend.
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle the logic for a single test case.

3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It initializes a list `v` with zeros and updates it with the values from the input.
   - It then iterates through the list to check if there exists a pair `(i, v[i])` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. This means that both friends in this pair will come to the party if invited.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where no such pair exists (`v[v[i]] != i` for all `i`), ensuring that at least 3 invitations are required.
   - The program also correctly identifies pairs of friends who can attend together, ensuring that the minimum number of invitations is calculated accurately.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`), the program correctly identifies that friends 4 and 5 can attend together, printing `2`.
   - For the second test case (`[2, 3, 4, 1]`), the program correctly identifies that at least 3 invitations are needed, printing `3`.
   - For the third test case (`[2, 1]`), the program correctly identifies that both friends can attend together, printing `2`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of invitations needed for at least 2 friends to attend the party.

**Correctness: True**
