Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` remains unchanged, `[u, v]` contains the integers u-1 and v-1, and a new edge (u-1, v-1) has been added to the tree.**

Explanation: The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and the list `[u, v]` remain unchanged. The list `[u, v]` now contains the integers `u - 1` and `v - 1`, which represent the nodes connected by the new edge.
