Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop runs until `n-1`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**.
