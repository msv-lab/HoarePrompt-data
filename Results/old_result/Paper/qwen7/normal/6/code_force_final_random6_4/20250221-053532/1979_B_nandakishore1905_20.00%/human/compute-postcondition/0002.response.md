Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

The code calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
