Output State: **`index` is 18 + n + n, `PB` is an integer value from `data[5]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `PS` is an integer value from `data[8]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is updated by adding `n` to its current value, which was `18 + n`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
