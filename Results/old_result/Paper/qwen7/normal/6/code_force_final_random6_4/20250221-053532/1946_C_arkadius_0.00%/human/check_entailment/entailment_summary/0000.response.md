Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that all the functions work together to solve the problem correctly. Let's break down the logic of each function and how they interact:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - `func_5` reads the input and constructs the tree using the `Tree` class.
   - The tree is rooted using `root_tree_non_recursive`.

2. **Counting Good Components and Remaining Size:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are essentially doing the same thing but in different ways. Both functions traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtrees.
   - `func_1` uses a stack-based approach, while `func_2` uses recursion. Both should give the same results.

3. **Checking Conditions for Good Components:**
   - `func_3` checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.

4. **Binary Search for the Maximum `x`:**
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that removing `k` edges results in connected components with sizes at least `x`.

5. **Main Function:**
   - `func_5` orchestrates the entire process by constructing the tree, rooting it, and then calling `func_4` to get the final result.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, each function seems to be performing the necessary steps to solve the problem. Here's a brief check of the correctness:

- The tree is correctly constructed and rooted.
- The traversal functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly count good components and remaining sizes.
- The conditions in `func_3` are correctly checked.
- The binary search in `func_4` is implemented correctly to find the maximum `x`.

Since all the functions work together to solve the problem as described, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
