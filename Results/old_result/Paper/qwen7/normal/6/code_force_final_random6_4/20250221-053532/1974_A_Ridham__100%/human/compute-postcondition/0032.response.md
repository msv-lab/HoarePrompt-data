Output State: **`remaining_cells` must be greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` retains its initial value, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `y * 4` to `space_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
