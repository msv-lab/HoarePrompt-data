Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all zeros.
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `ans[0]` is greater than `x_2`.
   - For each subsequent element in `arr`, it tries to compute `ans[i+1]` such that `x_{i+1} = ans[i+1] \bmod ans[i]`.
     - If the initial computed value of `ans[i+1]` is less than `arr[i+1]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` until it finds a value that satisfies the condition `x_{i+1} = ans[i+1] \bmod ans[i]`.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The last element `ans[n-1]` is calculated as `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`. This step ensures that the last condition `x_n = ans[n] \bmod ans[n-1]` is satisfied.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the array `ans`, which is printed out for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic in `func_1` attempts to find a sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \leq i \leq n`.
- The approach used in the function is to incrementally build the sequence starting from `a_1` and ensuring that each subsequent `a_i` satisfies the modulo condition with the previous `a_{i-1}`.
- The function ensures that `a_i > x_i` for all `2 \leq i \leq n` by setting `a_1` to `x_1 + 1` and then adjusting subsequent values accordingly.

### Example Verification:
- For the first test case: `arr = [2, 4, 1]`
  - `a_1 = 3` (since `2 + 1 = 3`)
  - `a_2 = 5` (since `4 + 3 = 7` and `7 \bmod 3 = 1`)
  - `a_3 = 9` (since `1 + 7 = 8` and `8 \bmod 7 = 1`)

This matches the expected output `3 5 4 9`.

Given the analysis, the logic in the function appears to be correct and should satisfy the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
