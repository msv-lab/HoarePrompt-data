Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ans` contains the sequence starting from `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1` down to `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by `adv`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `a` and `j` remain unchanged, `ans` is appended with `a[i]`, `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `counter[a[i]]` by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
