Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is `2` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is `0`, `t` is decreased by `1`, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `1`, and `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`.
