Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `x` is now the integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is now `v[x] + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `idx` is increased by 1 twice, and `v[x]` is updated to its current value plus 1.
