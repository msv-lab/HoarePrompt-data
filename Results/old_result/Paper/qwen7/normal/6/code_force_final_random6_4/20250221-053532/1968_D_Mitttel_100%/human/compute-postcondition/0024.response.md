Output State: `k` is `0`, `mx` is the maximum value between its previous value and `cur + k * a[s]` after all iterations, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `s` is the final position in the permutation after all iterations, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, `vis` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `1` at the indices visited during the iterations and `0` elsewhere.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `k` will be `0` because the loop condition `k > 0` will no longer be satisfied. The variable `mx` will hold the maximum value between its initial value (0) and the cumulative value of `cur + k * a[s]` after all iterations. The list `vis` will mark all visited positions in the permutation `p` with `1`, and the rest will remain `0`. The variables `n`, `a`, `p`, `s`, and `cur` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
