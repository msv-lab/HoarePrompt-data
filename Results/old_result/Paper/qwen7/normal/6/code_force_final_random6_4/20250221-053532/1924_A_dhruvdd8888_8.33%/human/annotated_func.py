#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))

        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be the last character of the string `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing all characters `i` from `s` that are in `us` and for which `len(win) == k` at some point during the loop, `win` is an empty set, and `ps` is the count of times `ans` was appended with a character, indicating how many times `win` reached size `k` during the loop.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES'
    #State: `i` is the last character of the string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing all characters `i` from `s` that are in `us` and for which `len(win) == k` at some point during the loop, `win` is an empty set, and `ps` is the count of times `ans` was appended with a character, indicating how many times `win` reached size `k` during the loop, and `ps` is less than `n`
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `us` is an empty set, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input string `s` to check if it contains at least `n` distinct characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If such a sequence exists, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a specific output string based on the missing characters.
