Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index `i` (which is now 1), and the conditions involving `x`, `y`, `b`, and `lit` remain the same.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If `len(b) == 0`, then `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. Both scenarios maintain the other conditions as specified in the precondition.
