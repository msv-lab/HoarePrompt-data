Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position where `x` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns `inx + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `inx`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Initializes `left` and `last` lists.
   - `left` stores cumulative sums of the array `a`.
   - `last` stores the index of the last occurrence of each element in `a` (to handle duplicate elements).
   - Iterates through the array `a` to populate `ans` with the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.
     - If the current slime is smaller than the previous one, it immediately gets eaten, so `ans[i] = 1`.
     - Otherwise, calculates the position `inx` where the current slime's size minus one would fit in the cumulative sum `left`.
     - Adjusts `inx` using the `last` list to account for duplicate elements.
     - If `inx` is valid, calculates the time taken for the slime to be eaten and updates `ans[i]`.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires calculating the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by a larger neighboring slime. If no such sequence exists, the answer should be `-1`.

### Correctness Check
1. **Initialization**:
   - `left` and `last` are initialized correctly to handle cumulative sums and duplicates.
   
2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - `left` is updated correctly to store cumulative sums, which helps in determining the position where a slime can be eaten.

3. **Duplicate Handling**:
   - `last` is used to handle duplicate elements, ensuring that the position of the last occurrence is considered when calculating the position `inx`.

4. **Eating Condition**:
   - The condition `if a[i] < a[i - 1]:` correctly identifies slimes that are immediately eaten.
   - The calculation of `inx` and `inx2` ensures that the position where the slime can be eaten is correctly determined.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The `ans` list is populated correctly with the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the code, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct and align with the problem requirements.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
