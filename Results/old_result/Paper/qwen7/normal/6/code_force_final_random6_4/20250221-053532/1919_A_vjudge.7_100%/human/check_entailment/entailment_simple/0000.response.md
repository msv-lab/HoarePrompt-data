Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`test`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b` which represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets respectively.
3. The key logic in the program is the condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:`. This checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints "Bob", otherwise it prints "Alice".
4. This logic aligns with the game rules provided in the problem statement. The game essentially boils down to determining if the total number of coins between both players is even or odd, which dictates the winner based on optimal play.
5. The program does not modify the values of `a` and `b` during the process, which is consistent with the problem constraints.
6. The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Correctness: **True**
