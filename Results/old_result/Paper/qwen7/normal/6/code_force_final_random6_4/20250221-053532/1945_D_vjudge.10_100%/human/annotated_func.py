#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is a string, a and b are lists of non-negative integers, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000, and the lengths of a and b are both equal to n.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, `pergunta` will hold the minimum value of `x + a[i]` for all `i` where `i < m`, `a` and `b` will remain as lists of non-negative integers with lengths equal to `n`, `n` and `m` will still be positive integers such that `1 <= m <= n <= 200000`, `x` will be the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be set to `-1`, `pergunta` will contain the smallest value obtained from `x + a[i]` for all valid `i` (where `i < m`), and `x` will be the cumulative sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. The lists `a` and `b` and the integers `n` and `m` will retain their original values from the initial state.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value of x + a[n-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two lists of non-negative integers, `a` and `b`, of length `n`, along with two positive integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200000\)). It calculates the cumulative sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. If `i < m`, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum value between its current value and `x + a[i]`. Finally, it prints the updated `pergunta`, which holds the smallest value obtained from `x + a[i]` for all valid `i` (where `i < m`). The function does not return any value; it modifies `pergunta` and prints its final value.
