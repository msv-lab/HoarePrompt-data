Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `res` is either `[1] * n` if `k` equals `n`, `range(n)` if `k` equals `1`, otherwise `[-1]`, `t` is `0`.

Explanation: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer. After all iterations, `t` will be reduced to `0` since we subtract `1` from `t` in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, after all the executions of the loop have finished, `t` will be `0`. The value of `res` will depend on the values of `n` and `k` provided during each iteration of the loop, but it will be one of the three possible states defined within the loop body: `[1] * n` if `k` equals `n`, `range(n)` if `k` equals `1`, otherwise `[-1]`.
