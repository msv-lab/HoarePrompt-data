Postcondition: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `num` is a list or array, `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from index 0 up to `n-2`. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is increased by 1. If `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**
