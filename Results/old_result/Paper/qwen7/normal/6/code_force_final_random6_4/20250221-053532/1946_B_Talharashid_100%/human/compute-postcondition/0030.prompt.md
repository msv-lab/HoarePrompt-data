Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `l` must have at least one integer element. If there exists an integer `ele` in `l` such that `ele` is less than 0 and the value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. Otherwise, `ele` is a non-negative integer, `c` is now `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `l` must have at least one integer element, `ele` is the next integer in `l`, `c` is either 0 or `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `l` must have at least two integer elements, `ele` is the next integer in `l`, `c` is either 0 or the previous value of `c` plus `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
