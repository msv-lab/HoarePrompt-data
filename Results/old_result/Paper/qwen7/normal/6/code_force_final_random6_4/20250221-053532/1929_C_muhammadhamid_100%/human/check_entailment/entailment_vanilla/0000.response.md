Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `s` is initialized to 1. This variable is intended to represent the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can achieve any number of coins `n`.

3. **Loop Calculation**:
   - A loop runs from `0` to `x-1` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
     - `s // (k - 1)` calculates how many times the current value of `s` can be divided by `(k - 1)`.
     - Adding 1 to this result means adding one more unit to the sum.
     - This operation essentially simulates the growth of Sasha's coins based on the betting strategy.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Reasoning

The key idea here is to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n` starting from `a` coins, given the constraints on the number of consecutive losses (`x`) and the multiplier `k`.

#### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Strategy Validity**:
   - The strategy used in the loop seems to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins assuming he wins every bet after a loss. However, this might not cover all possible sequences of wins and losses.

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is a simplified way to estimate the minimum number of coins needed to guarantee winning any number of coins. It assumes Sasha always wins after a loss, which might not be accurate for all scenarios.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the initial number of coins `a` is too small compared to the calculated `s`.

### Conclusion

Upon closer inspection, the program does not correctly simulate all possible sequences of wins and losses. Specifically, it assumes Sasha always wins after a loss, which might not be the case. The program might fail for certain inputs where Sasha cannot guarantee winning any number of coins due to the constraints on consecutive losses.

Therefore, the given program is **not correct**.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
