You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, where each element is within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, and the length of the list is denoted by len(arr).
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment

    #State: Output State: `segments_variants` is a list of all valid segment variants found during the loop execution, where each variant is a list containing the sum of the segment and the end index of the segment. `new_segment` is an empty list because it gets reset whenever a new segment with a higher sum is found. `max_segment` contains the sum and the end index of the segment with the maximum sum found throughout the loop execution. `max_sum` remains -1 because the loop does not update it. The value of `i` will be equal to the length of `arr` after the loop completes.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `segments_variants` will contain all the segments (defined by their sum and end index) that were found during the loop, `new_segment` will be empty, `max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum, and `max_sum` will still be -1 since it's not updated in the provided code.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: Output State: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `segment` does not exist because there are no elements left in `segments_variants`, `new_segment` remains an empty list, `max_segment` remains unchanged as it holds the segment with the highest sum found so far during the loop's execution, `max_sum` remains -1 since it was not updated after the last iteration, and `total_max_segment` remains unchanged and still holds the segment with the highest sum found throughout the loop's iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `segments_variants` is empty because all its elements have been processed. The variables `segment`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `total_max_segment` retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.
    if (len(total_max_segment) == 1) :
        total_max_segment = [-1]
    #State: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `segment` does not exist because there are no elements left in `segments_variants`, `new_segment` remains an empty list, `max_segment` remains unchanged as it holds the segment with the highest sum found so far during the loop's execution, `max_sum` remains -1 since it was not updated after the last iteration, and `total_max_segment` is now [-1].
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns the list `[-1]` which is the value of `total_max_segment`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. Each element in the list is within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, and the length of the list is denoted by `len(arr)`. The function returns the list `[-1]` which is the value of `total_max_segment`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `[-1]` which is the value of `total_max_segment`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
