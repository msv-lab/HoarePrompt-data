Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the area of a square by finding the squared distance between pairs of points and printing the larger of the two distances. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify the side length of the square.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distance between the first and fourth corners, and the second and third corners. This does not necessarily give the side length of the square. The side length could be the distance between any two adjacent corners, and the given method does not guarantee that it will always find the correct pair of adjacent corners.

2. **No Validation of Square Corners**: The program does not validate whether the calculated distances correspond to the sides of the square. It simply takes the larger of the two distances without ensuring that it represents the side length of the square.

3. **Lack of Proper Identification of Adjacent Corners**: The program does not explicitly check which pairs of points form the sides of the square. Without proper validation, it cannot ensure that the calculated distances represent the side lengths.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify the side length of the square.
- Ensure that the distances calculated represent the side length of the square.
- Calculate the area as the square of the side length.

Given these issues, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
