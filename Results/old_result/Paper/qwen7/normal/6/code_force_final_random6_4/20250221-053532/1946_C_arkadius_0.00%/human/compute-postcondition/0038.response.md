Output State: **The stack is a non-empty list containing tuples representing vertices from the tree, except for the last tuple which is popped, `v` is the first element of that tuple, and `postorder` is the second element of that tuple.**

This means that the last tuple from the stack has been removed (popped), and its elements (`v` and `postorder`) have been assigned to the respective variables. The stack now contains all the previous tuples from the original list, excluding the one just popped.
