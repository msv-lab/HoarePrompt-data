Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
    x = min(a, b)
    if k >= 2 * x:
        a -= x
        b -= x
        k -= 2 * x
    else:
        break
    if a > 0:
        nums.appendleft(a)
    else:
        ans += 1
    if b > 0:
        nums.append(b)
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-1 integers (excluding the first and last elements). If `b > 0` and `a > 0`, then `nums` is updated to append the value of `a` to the left end of the deque, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * b`, and both `a` and `b` are updated to `a - b` and `b - b` respectively. If `b > 0` and `a <= 0`, or if `b <= 0`, then `ans` is set to 1, and no changes are made to `k`, `a`, `b`, or `nums`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` is non-zero, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements, `a` is the first element that was popped from `nums`, `b` is the last element that was popped from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b > 0` and `a > 0` with `k \geq 2 \times x`, then `k` is reduced by \(2 \times x\), `a` is adjusted by subtracting the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is decreased by the minimum of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` and `b` are elements from `nums`, and `x` is the minimum of the new `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than 0, then either `a` and `b` are reduced by `3 * x` and `k` is reduced by `2 * x` if `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, or `a` and `b` remain unchanged and `x` remains as the minimum of the new `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged with `x` remaining as the minimum of the new `a` and `b`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
