Output State: **`idx` is increased by 1 again; `v[x]` is increased by 1; `x` is an integer from `data[idx]` and `idx` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1 again, while the values of `v[x]` and `x` remain unchanged. The variable `x` is still an integer derived from `data[idx]`.
