Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is a non-empty iterable with at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element from `res`, and `ul` is not equal to `ur`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the fifth element from `res`, `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`, and `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`. `ur` is 2 more than its original value if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2 and `ul` equals `ur`. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the sixth element from `res`, `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`, and `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`; if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` is increased by 2 and `ul` equals `ur`. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the seventh element from `res`, `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`, and `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`; if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ur` is `ur` plus 2. If `ul` does not equal `ur`, the conditions remain unchanged. We break out of the loop or condition we were inside.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
