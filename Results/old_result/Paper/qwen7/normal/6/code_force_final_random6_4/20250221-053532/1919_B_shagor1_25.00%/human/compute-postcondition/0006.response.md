Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n` that must be at least 1, and `neg` is 1. If the character `s[i]` is '-', `neg` remains 1. There is no change in the values of `t`, `n`, and `s` if there is no corresponding character '-' at position `i`.
