Output State: **`i` is added to the set `win`; `win` now contains `i` if `i` was in `us`, `ps` remains 0 if `i` was not in `us`, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing the elements `i` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially contained the element `i`, after appending `i` again, `ans` now contains the element `i` twice. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
