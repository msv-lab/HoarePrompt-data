Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1` correctly initializes counters for both arrays `a` and `b` after sorting them. This ensures that we are working with the most frequent elements first.

2. **Initial Check**: The initial check compares the sum of the counts of common elements between `a[:m]` and `b` (`sm`) with `k`. If this sum is already greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer (`ans`) immediately. This is correct because if the initial segment of length `m` in `a` already meets the requirement, it should be counted.

3. **Sliding Window**: The sliding window approach is used correctly to check each subsequent subsegment of length `m` in `a`. For each new element added to the window from the right (`a[r]`), it increments the corresponding counter and decrements the counter for the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[r-m]`). It also updates `sm` accordingly.

4. **Condition Check**: The condition `if sm >= k:` is checked after updating `sm` for each new subsegment. If the condition is met, `ans` is incremented. This ensures that only subsegments meeting the requirement are counted.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge case where the initial segment itself meets the requirement before entering the loop.

Given that the logic follows the problem statement correctly and handles all necessary checks and updates, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
