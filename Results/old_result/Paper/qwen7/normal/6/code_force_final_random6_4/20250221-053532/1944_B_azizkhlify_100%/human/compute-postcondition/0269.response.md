Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number input, `k` is an integer equal to the second number input, `a` is a list of integers equal to the numbers input after the two integers separated by spaces, `l` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l` with `n` elements, each initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
