Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function arguments `1` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being `1`. This is explicitly stated in the `range(1, n)`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` is `1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must remain less than `n` throughout the iterations.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` starts at `1` and remains less than `n` during the loop execution. 

Here is the modified state:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `rgt` is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `sng` is an empty list.**
