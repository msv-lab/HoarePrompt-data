Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic in the `else` block does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Let's consider a specific case to illustrate this:

For the input:
```
255 8
```
The program outputs:
```
YES
2
254 1
```
However, let's analyze this:
- At the first stall, Alice has 255 coins and the price is 254 coins per jewel. She buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin.
- At the second stall, Alice has 1 coin and the price is 1 coin per jewel. She buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins.

So, Alice buys a total of 2 jewels, not 8 as required. This shows that the program does not correctly set up the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
