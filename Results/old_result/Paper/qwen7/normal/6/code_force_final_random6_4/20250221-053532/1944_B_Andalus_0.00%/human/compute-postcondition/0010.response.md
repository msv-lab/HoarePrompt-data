Output State: **`rgt` is a list containing the sorted elements of `lst` starting from index `n`, `rgt` is a list of integers, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `rgt.sort()` sorts the list `rgt` in ascending order. Since `rgt` originally contained the sorted elements of `lst` starting from index `n`, sorting it again does not change its content. All other variables remain unchanged.
