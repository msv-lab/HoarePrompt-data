Output State: **`total` is 4, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 5, `values[0]` is 0, `values[3]` is 3, `values[4]` is 4, `sum_values[2]` is 1, `sum_values[3]` is 4**

Explanation: The code updates `values[i]` to `i`, where `i` is 4. So, `values[4]` is now 4. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
