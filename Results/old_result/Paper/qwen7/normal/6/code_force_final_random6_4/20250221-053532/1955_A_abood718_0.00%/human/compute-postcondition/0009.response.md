Output State: **`i` is 0, `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), and \(B * 2 < C\); `X` is \(A // 2\)**.

Explanation: The code `X = A // 2` assigns the value of `A // 2` to `X`. Since `A` is the first non-negative integer within the specified range, `X` will be half of `A` (integer division). All other variables remain unchanged. The condition \(B * 2 < C\) also remains valid.
