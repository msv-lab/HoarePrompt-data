Output State: **`t` must be at least 1**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (assuming `func_1()` does not modify `t`), the value of `t` remains unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be at least 1 is still valid after the function call.
