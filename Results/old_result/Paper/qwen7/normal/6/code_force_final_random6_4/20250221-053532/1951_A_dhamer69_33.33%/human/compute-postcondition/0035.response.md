The loop condition for the given `while` loop is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `start` is an integer
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`
- `t` is equal to `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is an input string
- `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`

Since the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop condition is `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Given that `t` is equal to `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been greater than 1 for the loop to have entered this iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 but less than or equal to 1 (since it was decremented by 1).

Thus, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`total` is not mentioned in the problem, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.**
