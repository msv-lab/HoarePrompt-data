You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing the current array segment being processed, and bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit).
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the length of the list 'cur_arr'
    #State: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing the current array segment being processed, and bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit). The value of bit is not -1.
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of 0, `xor` is 0, and `new_arr` will contain the cumulative result of the XOR operation on all elements of `cur_arr` considering each bit position from `bit` down to 0.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1
    else :
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    #State: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of 0, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is either -1 or the result of calling `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` depending on whether the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1 or 0.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
        #The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`
    else :
        return thing1
        #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter cur_arr, which is a list of non-negative integers, and a parameter bit, which is an integer representing the current bit position. Depending on the bit position, the function either returns the length of the list cur_arr, the maximum value between the result of calling itself with the previous bit position and a new list, or -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the length of the list 'cur_arr'

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`

Case_3: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
