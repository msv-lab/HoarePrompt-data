Reasoning:
1. The main function `func_2()` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, which in turn calls `calculate_score(start_pos)` to compute the scores for both Bodya and Sasha.
3. The `calculate_score(start_pos)` function correctly calculates the score for a given starting position by handling both non-cyclic and cyclic paths within the permutation.
4. The logic in `func_1()` correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given that the provided functions correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handle all aspects of the game, including cycles in the permutation, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
