Output State: **`den` is equal to `func_1(den, x)`, `N` must be at least 1, `vals` must be a list with at least one element**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `den` to the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `den` and `x`. The preconditions that `N` must be at least 1 and `vals` must be a list with at least one element remain unchanged. The specific value of `den` is updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)`, but since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we only know that `den` is now equal to `func_1(den, x)`.
