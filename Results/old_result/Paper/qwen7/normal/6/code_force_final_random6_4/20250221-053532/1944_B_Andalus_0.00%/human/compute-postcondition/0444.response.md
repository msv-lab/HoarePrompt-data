Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over `elem` in `sng`. The only variables directly involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `sng` contains at least one element. The variable `sz` is updated to `sz + 1` during each iteration, but it does not affect the loop condition directly.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sng` must contain at least one element.
   - `sz` is `sz` + 1.
   - If the size of `sng` (denoted as `sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `sng` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, and assuming the loop did not break due to `sz >= k`, `sng` still contains at least one element.
   - `sz` is incremented by 1 from the previous value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `sng` still contains at least one element and `sz` is incremented by 1.

**State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is `sz` + 1**
