Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies whether the array is constant (all elements are the same).
2. It then checks for the minimum length of consecutive segments where the elements are the same.
3. The logic for finding the minimum segment length is correct. It iterates through the array and keeps track of the count of consecutive elements that are the same, updating the minimum count found.
4. If the array is constant, the program correctly outputs -1.
5. However, there is a potential issue with the logic when the array is not constant. The program should find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure the array stops being beautiful. The current implementation finds the minimum segment length where elements are the same but does not account for removing these elements to break the beauty condition.

Given the problem statement, the program should identify the smallest segment where the removal of elements would prevent the array from being beautiful. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure the array stops being beautiful.
