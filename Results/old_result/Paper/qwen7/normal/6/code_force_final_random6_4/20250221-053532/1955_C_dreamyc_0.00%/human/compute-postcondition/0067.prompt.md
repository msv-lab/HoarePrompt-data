You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is non-zero and there are at least two elements in `nums`. After all iterations, `ans` will be the total count of times the condition `a <= 0` or `b <= 0` was met, which increments `ans` by 1. `k` will be reduced by the sum of all the `2 * x` values where `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b` in each iteration. `nums` will eventually become a deque with either 0 or 1 element left, depending on whether the last two elements were reduced to zero or not. If the last two elements were reduced to zero, `ans` will be incremented by 2 for each such pair, and `nums` will be empty. If one of the last two elements was reduced to zero but the other was not, `ans` will be incremented by 1, and `nums` will contain the non-zero element. If neither of the last two elements was reduced to zero, `ans` will not be incremented, and `nums` will contain the two non-zero elements.
    #
    #In summary, the final state will have `ans` being the total count of times elements were reduced to zero, `k` being the remaining value after all reductions, and `nums` being either empty or containing up to two non-zero elements.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns ans + 1, where ans is the total count of times the condition a <= 0 or b <= 0 was met during the iterations, and 1 is added to it.
    #State: `ans` is the total count of times elements were reduced to zero, `k` is the remaining value after all reductions, and `nums` is either empty or containing up to two non-zero elements. Additionally, `k` is zero or `len(nums)` is greater than 1 or `k` is less than `nums[0]` if `len(nums)` is 1.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is the total count of times elements were reduced to zero.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums (a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns either ans + 1, where ans is the total count of times the condition a <= 0 or b <= 0 was met during the iterations, and 1 is added to it, or ans, which is the total count of times elements were reduced to zero.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns ans + 1, where ans is the total count of times the condition a <= 0 or b <= 0 was met during the iterations, and 1 is added to it.

Case_2: The program returns ans, which is the total count of times elements were reduced to zero.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
