Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 1. The current value of `l` is equal to `r`, and whether `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2` or not, `l` is set to 1 and `r` is set to `n - 2`, and `sunks` is set to 3, or `l` remains equal to `r`, and whether `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k` or not, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
