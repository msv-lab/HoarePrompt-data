Reasoning:

1. The program correctly defines the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
3. The function `func_1` is defined to process these values.
4. The function initializes `x` to 0 and `pergunta` to infinity.
5. It iterates over the range from `n-1` to `0` in reverse order.
6. For each index `i`, it checks if `i < m`. If true, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
7. It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.
8. After the loop, it prints the value of `pergunta`.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. The logic matches the described steps and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
