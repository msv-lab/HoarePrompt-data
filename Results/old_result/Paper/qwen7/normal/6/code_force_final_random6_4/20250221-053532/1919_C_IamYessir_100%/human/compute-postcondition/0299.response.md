Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with one more element than before, where the last element is `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')`, and `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.

This postcondition summarizes that if the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is true, then `i` is 2 or 3, `n` remains unchanged, `a` gains an additional element which is `lit[i]`, and `x` becomes the new last element of `a`. If the condition is false, `i` remains 2 or 3, `n` remains unchanged, and `a` remains as it was before the if statement, with `x` being the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` and `y` remaining the same as defined.
