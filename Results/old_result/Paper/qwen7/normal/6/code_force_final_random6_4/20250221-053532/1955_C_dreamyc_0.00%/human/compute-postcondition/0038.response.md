`ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is either 1 or 2 (depending on the initial value), `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements, `a` is the first element that was popped from `nums`, `b` is the last element that was popped from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.
