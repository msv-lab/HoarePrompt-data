Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer representing the number of operations, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `operations` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x indicating the type of operation (1 or 2) and the value x, and `queries` is a list of integers k_i representing the positions of the elements Jayden wants to know.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged from their initial state.
