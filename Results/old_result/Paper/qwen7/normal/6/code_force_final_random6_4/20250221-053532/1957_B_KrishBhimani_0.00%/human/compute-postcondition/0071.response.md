Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is half of its original value (k0), `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0 and 1, `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` shifts the bits of `k` one place to the right, effectively dividing `k` by 2. Since `k` was originally a non-zero integer, its new value is half of its original value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
