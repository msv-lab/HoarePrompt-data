Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange the permutation array with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at position `l`.
2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly in the `func_1` function. It narrows down the search range until it finds the target value or determines it's not present.
3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - If the target value `x` is not found at the initial midpoint (`array[mid]`), we need to ensure it is swapped into its correct position.
   - If `array[l]` is not equal to `x`, we need to swap `array[l]` with the correct position of `x`.
   - If `array[r+1]` is not equal to `x`, we need to swap `array[r+1]` with the correct position of `x`.

Given the constraints and the problem statement, the logic in the `func_1` function does not fully address the requirement to perform at most 2 swaps. Specifically:
- The current implementation only checks if `array[l]` is not equal to `x` and swaps if necessary.
- It does not consider the possibility that `array[r+1]` might also need to be swapped to ensure `p_l` is equal to `x`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that both potential swaps are considered and performed if necessary. The current implementation only handles one swap scenario and may miss the second required swap.

Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the binary search will find the target value `x` at position `l` with at most 2 swaps. The logic in `func_1` needs to be revised to handle both potential swap scenarios.
