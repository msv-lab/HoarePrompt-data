Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 1, and the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement because `l` equals `r`.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since the initial conditions and the state of the variables before the `break` statement are already given, they remain unchanged.
