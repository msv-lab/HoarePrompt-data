Output State: `end` is increased to the maximum number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - end`, `r` is the last index of the list `a`, and `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]` for all indices from `l` to `r - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `end` will be equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list `a`. The variable `l` will be set to `r - end`, meaning it points to the first element that is not equal to the others at the beginning of the list. The list `a` will have all its consecutive equal elements at the start processed, with `a[l]` being equal to `a[l + 1]` and so on until `a[r - 1]`, where `r` is the last index of the list.
