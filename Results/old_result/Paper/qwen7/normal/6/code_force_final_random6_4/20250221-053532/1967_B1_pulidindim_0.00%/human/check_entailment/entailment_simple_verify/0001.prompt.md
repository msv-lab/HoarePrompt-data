You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an integer such that the loop condition `count <= m` evaluates to false, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the series \(\sum_{k=2}^{m+1} \left(\frac{n}{k} - (k-2)\right) + 1\), `countmins` is 0, `g` is now `n / (m + 1) - 0



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `count = 2` to `count <= m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The result is printed as an integer.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Example Test Cases

1. **Test Case (1, 1):**
   - `n = 1`, `m = 1`
   - `count` starts at 2 and never enters the loop because `count > m`.
   - `ans` remains `n = 1`.
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case (2, 3):**
   - `n = 2`, `m = 3`
   - `count` starts at 2.
     - `count = 2`: `countmins = 1`, `g = 2 / 2 = 1`, `g - countmins = 0`, break.
     - `ans = 2 + 0 = 2`
     - `count` increments to 3.
     - `count = 3`: `countmins = 2`, `g = 2 / 3 < 2`, break.
     - `ans` remains `2`.
   - Output: `3` (Incorrect, should be `2`)

3. **Test Case (3, 5):**
   - `n = 3`, `m = 5`
   - `count` starts at 2.
     - `count = 2`: `countmins = 1`, `g = 3 / 2 = 1.5`, `g - countmins = 0.5`, `ans = 3 + 0.5 + 1 = 4.5`.
     - `count` increments to 3.
     - `count = 3`: `countmins = 2`, `g = 3 / 3 = 1`, `g - countmins = 0`, break.
     - `ans = 4.5 + 0 = 4.5`.
   - Output: `4` (Incorrect, should be `4`)

4. **Test Case (10, 8):**
   - `n = 10`, `m = 8`
   - `count` starts at 2.
     - `count = 2`: `countmins = 1`, `g = 10 / 2 = 5`, `g - countmins = 4`, `ans = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15`.
     - `count` increments to 3.
     - `count = 3`: `countmins = 2`, `g = 10 / 3 ≈ 3.33`, `g - countmins = 1.33`, `ans = 15 + 1.33 + 1 = 17.33`.
     - `count` increments to 4.
     - `count = 4`: `countmins = 3`, `g = 10 / 4 = 2.5`, `g - countmins = -0.5`, break.
     - `ans` remains `17.33`.
   - Output: `14` (Incorrect, should be `14`)

5. **Test Case (100, 1233):**
   - `n = 100`, `m = 1233`
   - The loop will run until `count` exceeds `m`, which is 1233.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs.
   - Output: `153` (Incorrect, should be `153`)

6. **Test Case (1000000, 1145141):**
   - `n = 1000000`, `m = 1145141`
   - The loop will run until `count` exceeds `m`, which is 1145141.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs.
   - Output: `1643498` (Incorrect, should be `1643498`)

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to accurately count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
