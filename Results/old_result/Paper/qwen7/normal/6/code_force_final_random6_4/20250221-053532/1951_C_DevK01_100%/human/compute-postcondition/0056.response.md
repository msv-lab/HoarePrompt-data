Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\), `L` is a list of integers from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` is the number of elements in the list `N`, `m` is updated to the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu**.

Explanation: The code updates the `cost` variable by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `cost` is now the sum of its previous value and the new expression involving `m`, `sum(N)`, `mu`, and `n`.
