Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t-2 \leq 10^4\), `a` is the last input integer, `s` is the last input string from the user, `x` is the total number of occurrences of 'map' in all input strings, `y` is the total number of occurrences of 'pie' in all input strings, and `z` is the total number of occurrences of 'mapie' in all input strings. The loop processes each test case individually, updating `x`, `y`, and `z` with counts from each input string, and prints the result `x + y - z` for each test case.
