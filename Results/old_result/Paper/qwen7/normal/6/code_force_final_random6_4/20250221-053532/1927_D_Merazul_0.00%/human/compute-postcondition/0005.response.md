Output State: **`t` is 0, `k` is the second element returned by R(), `a` is a set containing the first element returned by R().**

Explanation: The code `a = {*R()}` calls the function `R()` which returns two elements. Let's denote these elements as `first_element` and `second_element`. The set comprehension `{*R()}` unpacks these two elements into a set, resulting in a set containing only the `first_element`. The variable `t` remains unchanged with the value 0, and `k` retains its value as the second element returned by `R()`. Therefore, `a` is a set containing the `first_element`, while `t` and `k` keep their initial values.
