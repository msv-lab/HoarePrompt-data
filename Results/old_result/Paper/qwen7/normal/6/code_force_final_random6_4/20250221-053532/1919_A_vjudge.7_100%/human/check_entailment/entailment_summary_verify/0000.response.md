### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, with \(a\) and \(b\) coins respectively.
- Players take turns, with Alice starting first.
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep them as is.
- After choosing, each player removes one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it checks if the sum of \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
- If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

#### Strategic Consideration:
- The key insight here is that the game can be analyzed based on the parity of the total number of coins (\(a + b\)).
- If \(a + b\) is even, Bob can always force a win by ensuring that after each of his turns, the total number of coins remains even.
- If \(a + b\) is odd, Alice can always force a win by ensuring that after each of her turns, the total number of coins remains odd.

#### Example Walkthrough:
1. **Case \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\):**
   - Initial: \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\)
   - Sum: \(1 + 2 = 3\) (odd)
   - Alice can swap, making \(a = 2\), \(b = 1\).
   - Bob removes a coin from his wallet, making \(b = 0\).
   - Alice is now forced to swap back, making \(a = 0\), \(b = 1\).
   - Bob removes a coin from his wallet, making \(b = 0\).
   - Alice is unable to make a move, so Bob wins.

2. **Case \(a = 2\), \(b = 1\):**
   - Initial: \(a = 2\), \(b = 1\)
   - Sum: \(2 + 1 = 3\) (odd)
   - Alice can swap, making \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\).
   - Bob removes a coin from his wallet, making \(b = 1\).
   - Alice is now forced to swap back, making \(a = 2\), \(b = 0\).
   - Bob removes a coin from his wallet, making \(b = 0\).
   - Alice is unable to make a move, so Bob wins.

From these examples, we see that the program's logic aligns with the strategic analysis. The program correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins, which is the optimal strategy for determining the winner.

**Final: True**
