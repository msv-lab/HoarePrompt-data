Output State: **`ans` is updated with the value `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1` appended, `a` retains its previous value, `j` is `adv`, and `ans` now contains the new element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.**

This means that the list `ans` has had a new element added to it, which is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, where `j` is equal to `adv`. The variable `a` remains unchanged from its previous state, and `j` is set to the value of `adv`.
