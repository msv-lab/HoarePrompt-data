Functionality: **The function processes up to 100 sets of coordinates, where each set consists of four integers representing the corners of a square. For each set, it calculates the squared distance between the first and fourth corners, and the squared distance between the second and third corners. It then prints the larger of these two distances. The function does not return any value but outputs the maximum distance found among all sets processed.**
