Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `x` is now the integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `idx` is increased by 1.**

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `idx` is increased by 1, while `n`, `x`, and `v[x]` retain their original values and conditions.
