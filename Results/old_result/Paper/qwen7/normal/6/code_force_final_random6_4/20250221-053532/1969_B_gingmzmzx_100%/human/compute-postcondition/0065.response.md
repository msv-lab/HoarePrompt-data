Output State: **`cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The code `ans = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. Since `cnt` and `zeroes` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. The initial value of `ans` was defined based on the conditions involving `cnt` and `zeroes`, but since those variables are not modified, `ans` remains 0.
