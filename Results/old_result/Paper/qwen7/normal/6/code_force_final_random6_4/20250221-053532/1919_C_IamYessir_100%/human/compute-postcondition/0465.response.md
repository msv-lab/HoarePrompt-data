Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[3]`; `b` is a list (possibly empty); `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is non-empty, otherwise `y` remains infinity. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[3]` and `lit[3]` is greater than `y`, then `x` and `y` retain their original values. Otherwise, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
