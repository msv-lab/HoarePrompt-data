Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `ans` is a list of n elements, each initialized to 0; `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[0]` has been updated to `arr[0] + 1`, while all other variables remain in their initial state as described in the initial state.
