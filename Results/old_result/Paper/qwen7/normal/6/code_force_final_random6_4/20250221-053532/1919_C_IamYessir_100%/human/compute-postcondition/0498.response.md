Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `len(a)`. These are the variables that determine whether the loop can continue.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition tells us that at the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `initial_i + 2`.
   - `n` remains as it was initially.
   - `s` is either `s + 1` if `a[i] > a[i - 1]`, or `s` remains unchanged if `a[i] <= a[i - 1]`.

3. **Determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration**: Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by `1` each time, the next value of `i` should be `initial_i + 3`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(a)`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(a)` for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to `initial_i + 3`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `s` could either be `s + 1` or remain unchanged based on the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]`. However, since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we don't need to specify the exact value of `s` here.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `initial_i + 3`, `n` remains as it was initially**.
