Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted according to the rules.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop condition `i < k` must be true for the loop to start executing. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to a value less than `k`.
   - `i` is incremented within the loop, so it will start from 0 and increment until it reaches `k`.

3. **Initial Values of `i` and `k`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < k`, `i` must be 0 initially.
   - `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `n`, `m`, `c`, `M`, `s`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. They will retain their initial values as given.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
