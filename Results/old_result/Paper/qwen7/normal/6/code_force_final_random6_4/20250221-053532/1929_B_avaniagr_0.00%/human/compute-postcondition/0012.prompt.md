You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute for each line of input until there are no more lines to read. For each iteration, `n` and `k` will be updated to the values from the current line of input split by spaces. After all iterations, `s` will be the last line of input (if available), and `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last line of input.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` and `k` will contain the values from the last line of input provided, and `s` will be the last line of input (if any). The loop processes each line of input exactly once, updating `n` and `k` accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three integers: t, n, and k where t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers within the ranges 2 to 10^8 and 1 to 4n - 2 respectively. The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
