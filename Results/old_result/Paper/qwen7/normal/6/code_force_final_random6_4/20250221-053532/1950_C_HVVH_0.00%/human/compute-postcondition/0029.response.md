Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':' and decreased by 12.**

Explanation: The code `h = h - 12` subtracts 12 from the value of `h`. Since `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':', the new value of `h` is the original value of `h` minus 12. All other variables remain unchanged.
