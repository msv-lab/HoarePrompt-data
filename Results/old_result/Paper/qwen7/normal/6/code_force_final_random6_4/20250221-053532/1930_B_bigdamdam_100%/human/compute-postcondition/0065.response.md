Output State: **`p[i+2]` is assigned the value of `ind` - 2, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, and `p[i]` is assigned the value of `ind`.**

In this output state, the value of `p[i]` has been updated to `ind`, while the other variables (`p[i+2]`, `i`, and `n`) retain their previously assigned values.
