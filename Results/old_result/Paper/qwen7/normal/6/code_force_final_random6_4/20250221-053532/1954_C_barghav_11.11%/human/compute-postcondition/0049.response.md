Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(len(b))`. The variables involved here are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `b` is a list with at least one element

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(b)`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The list `b` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1
- `b` is a list with at least one element

So, the final state is:
**`i` is 1, `b` is a list with at least one element**
