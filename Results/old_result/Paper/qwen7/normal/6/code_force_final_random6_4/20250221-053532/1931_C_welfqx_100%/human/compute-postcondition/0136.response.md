Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `num` is a list or array, `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from index 0 up to `n-2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `ii`, `n`, `num`, or `cn`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
