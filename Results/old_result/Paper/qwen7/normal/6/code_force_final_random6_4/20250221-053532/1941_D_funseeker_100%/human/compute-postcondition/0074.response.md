Output State: **`ans` is not an empty set, `q` is the first element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing two elements which are `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()`, and its value is either '1' or '?'.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Initially, `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`. After executing the line `temp.add((q - r) % n)`, `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
