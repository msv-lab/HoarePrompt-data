Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `i` is incremented by 1**.

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers entered by the user and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. It does not affect the value of `i` which is incremented by 1 in the initial state, and the condition that `q` must be greater than `i + 2` remains unchanged.
