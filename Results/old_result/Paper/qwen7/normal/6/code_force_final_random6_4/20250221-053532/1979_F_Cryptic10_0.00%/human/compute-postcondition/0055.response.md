Output State: **`d` is `n - 2`, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, `path` now includes the value of `v` appended, and we continue the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the value of `v` from the `remaining_vertices` list. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
