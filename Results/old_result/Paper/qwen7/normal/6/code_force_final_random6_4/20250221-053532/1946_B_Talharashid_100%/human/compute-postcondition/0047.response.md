Postcondition: `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0, `c` is updated to either `c + ele` if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
