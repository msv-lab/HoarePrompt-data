Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. The function `func_1` does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that the elements are picked according to the rules of the game. Instead, it simply counts the frequency of elements in the array and prints the first element that appears either once or twice, which does not reflect the optimal strategy for the game.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and ensure that Alice always picks an element that maximizes the MEX of the resulting array `c`, while Bob minimizes it. This involves more complex logic to handle the turns and the optimal choices at each step.
