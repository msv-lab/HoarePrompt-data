Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).
- `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string.
- `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string.
- The current value of `b[n - 2]` is equal to the string '<'.

The print statement is `print('No')`.

The value being printed is a string literal 'No', and it does not depend on the values of `n`, `a`, or `b` other than the fact that `b[n - 2]` is '<'. Since the print statement directly outputs the string 'No', the output will be:

Output: **No**
