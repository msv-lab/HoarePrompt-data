Postcondition: `l` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `end` is increased by 3 and now equals `end + 3`. The first element of the list `a` is equal to the last element of the list `a`.
