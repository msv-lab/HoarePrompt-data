Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is 0 + the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is greater than 0. If `lst` does not have a length of 2, the second element of `lst` has been removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, either the second element is removed or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is not 2, or twice the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is 2 or the second element has been removed if the length is not 2. `i` is 2 if `len(lst)` is not 2, and `i` is 1 if `len(lst)` is 2 or the second element has been removed. `n` is greater than 0 in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is not 2, or 0 plus twice the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is 2; `i` is 3 if `len(lst)` is not 2, and `i` is 2 if `len(lst)` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
