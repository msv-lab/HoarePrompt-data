Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring shifted.
2. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is intended to count the number of consecutive '1's in the binary string and add the length of each group of '1's plus one to the answer. However, this function does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the string.
   - The function reads a binary string as a list of integers, which is incorrect because the problem specifies reading a single binary string, not multiple integers.
   - The logic inside the loop does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string. Instead, it incorrectly sums the lengths of groups of '1's plus one.
3. **Function `func_2()` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` is supposed to handle multiple test cases. It calls `func_1()` for each test case but does not correctly process the input or output as required by the problem.
   - The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. However, `func_1()` is not designed to handle the actual problem requirements.
4. **Conclusion**:
   - Both functions do not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. `func_1()` does not calculate the minimum cost to sort the string, and `func_2()` does not properly handle the input and output as required.

Correctness: **False**
