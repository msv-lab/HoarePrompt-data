Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, steps is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split, `h` is the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `g` and `h`. The other variables (`t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`) remain unchanged.
