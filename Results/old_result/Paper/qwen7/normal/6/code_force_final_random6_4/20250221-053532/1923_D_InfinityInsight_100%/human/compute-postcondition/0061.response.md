Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` remains unchanged, `ans[2]` is 1, `inx` is `last[1]`, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the scope of the `continue` statement, all the variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
