Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, and `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between the current value of `ans` and the value of `cnt`. Since `cnt` is 0 after the loop, `ans` will be updated to be the minimum of its current value and 0. However, without knowing the exact value of `ans` before this line, we can only say that `ans` is now the minimum of its original value and 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as described above.
