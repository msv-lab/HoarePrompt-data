Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the last element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 1, and `rdb` is an empty iterable, `ldb` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ldb`. This does not affect the values of `sng`, `elem`, `sz`, `rdb`, or `rgt`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
