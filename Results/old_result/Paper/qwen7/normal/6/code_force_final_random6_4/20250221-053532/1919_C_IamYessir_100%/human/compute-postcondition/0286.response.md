Postcondition: **`i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and may have one more element added, `x` is the last element of list `a`, and `y` is the last element of list `a` if `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, or infinity if `b` is empty.**
