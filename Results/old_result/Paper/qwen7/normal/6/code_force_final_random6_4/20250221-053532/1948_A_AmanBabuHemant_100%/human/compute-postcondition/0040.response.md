Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` and then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, checks if `n` is even, and either prints 'NO' or constructs a string `s` consisting of 'AAB' repeated `(n // 2)` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by `s`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
