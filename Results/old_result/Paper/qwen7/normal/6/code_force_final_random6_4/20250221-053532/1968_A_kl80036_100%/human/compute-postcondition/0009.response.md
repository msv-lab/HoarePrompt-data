Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is `x - 1`, `i` is `previous_i + 2`**.

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the new input integer to `x`. The values of `y` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `y` is still `x - 1` and `i` is still `previous_i + 2`. The precondition that `new_input_value` must be greater than or equal to `previous_i + 2` is still valid.
