Output State: **`index` is 5, `PB` is an integer value from `data[5]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `PB = int(data[index + 2])` updates the value of `PB` by converting the element at index `index + 2` in the `data` list to an integer. Since `index` is initially 3, `index + 2` equals 5. Therefore, `PB` is assigned the integer value from `data[5]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
