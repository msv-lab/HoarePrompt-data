Output State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` is 20, `c` is 0**.

The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. Since `k`, `arr`, and `i` were not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial variables and the new variable `c` initialized to 0.
