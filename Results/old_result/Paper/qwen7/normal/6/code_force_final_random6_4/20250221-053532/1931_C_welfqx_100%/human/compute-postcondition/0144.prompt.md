Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n - 1`, and `cn` will be the count of consecutive identical elements starting from index 0 up to `n-2`. The loop will exit if any pair of consecutive elements in `num` are not identical.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(n - 1):
    if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
        ck += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `num` is a list or array that allows checking consecutive elements without exiting prematurely, `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from index 0 up to `n-2`. If `onum[0]` is equal to `onum[1]`, then `cn` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the loop or if-else block is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ii` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `num` is a list or array, `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from index 0 up to `n-2`, and if `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is increased by 1. If `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ii` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `num` is a list or array, `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from index 0 up to `n-2`. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is increased by 1. If `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
