Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `first` is `True`.
   - `i` is `1`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `n`, we need to update these two variables.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such information is given, we assume `n` stays the same.

5. **Postcondition**: The postcondition does not affect the loop continuation directly. It only provides additional context about the behavior inside the loop, but it doesn't change the loop control variables.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`first` is True, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
