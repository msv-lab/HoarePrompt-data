Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` remains unchanged and `b` is a list with its last element being `a[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, and `b` remain as they were initially.
