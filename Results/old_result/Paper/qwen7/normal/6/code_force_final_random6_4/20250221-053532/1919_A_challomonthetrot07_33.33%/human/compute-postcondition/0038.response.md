Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 1 if `a` is even and 0 if `a` is odd, `a` and `b` are input integers, and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `a` is set to `b`. Otherwise, if `a` is even, `a` is divided by 2. If `a` is odd, `i` is set to 1. If `b` equals 1, `b` remains 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, `a` is set to 0.**
