Output State: **`i` is 1; `ls` is the original value of `ls` plus `nums[1]`; `nums[1]` is decreased by `ls`.**

Explanation: The code `ls += nums[i]` increments `ls` by the value of `nums[i]`, which is `nums[1]` since `i` is 1. The original value of `ls` is added to `nums[1]`, and then `nums[1]` is decreased by this sum. All other variables remain unchanged.
