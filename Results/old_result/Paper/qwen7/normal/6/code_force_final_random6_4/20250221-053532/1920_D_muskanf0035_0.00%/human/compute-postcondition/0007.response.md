The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of input integers formed by splitting the input string and converting it to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**
