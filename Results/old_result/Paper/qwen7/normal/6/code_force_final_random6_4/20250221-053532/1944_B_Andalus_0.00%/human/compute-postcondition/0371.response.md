Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is either equal to its original value or its original value plus 2, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is less than 2. After the execution of the if-else block, if `sz >= k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `sz < k`, no additional changes occur to `sz`.
