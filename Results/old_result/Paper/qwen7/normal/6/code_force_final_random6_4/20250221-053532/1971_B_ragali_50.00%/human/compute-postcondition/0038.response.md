Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `i` is equal to `t`
   - `s` is a non-empty stripped input string
   - `a` contains the element `i`

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.
   - Since `i` is set to the value of `t` and `t` is greater than 0, `i` will be a character from the string `s`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `s` will be the remaining part of the string after removing the current character.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
- `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
- `s` will be the remaining part of the string after removing the current character.
- `a` still contains the element `i` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `s` is the remaining part of the string after removing the current character, `a` contains the element `i`**
