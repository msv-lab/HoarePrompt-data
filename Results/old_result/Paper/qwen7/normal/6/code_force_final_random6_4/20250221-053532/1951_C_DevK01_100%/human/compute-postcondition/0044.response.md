Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\), `L` is a list of integers from the input, `M` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `n` is the length of the sublist `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`**.

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This updates the value of `M` to a list of integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `L`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, and `N`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and conditions, but their specific values may now depend on the new list `M`.
