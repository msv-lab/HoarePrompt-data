Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. The list `rdb` will contain all elements of `rgt` starting from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element in `rgt`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements up to the second last element of `rgt`. The list `rdb` will include every element from `rgt` starting from the second element (index 1) to the second last element (index `n-1`) if these elements are identical to their immediate predecessor in the list `rgt`.
