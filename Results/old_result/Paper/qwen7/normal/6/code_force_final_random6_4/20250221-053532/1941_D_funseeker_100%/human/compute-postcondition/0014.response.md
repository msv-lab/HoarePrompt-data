Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, `temp` now includes `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `c` is either '1' or '?', and the current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'**.

Explanation: The code adds `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` already included `(q + r) % n`, it now includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The values of `ans`, `c`, `q`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
