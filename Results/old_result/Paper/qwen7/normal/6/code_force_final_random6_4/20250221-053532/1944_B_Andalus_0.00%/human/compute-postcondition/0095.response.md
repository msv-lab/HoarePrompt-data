Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The key variables here are `elem` (which is being iterated over) and `sng` (the sequence).

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: 
   - `sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`.
   - `sz` is increased by 1 within the loop.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is exited if the condition `sz >= k` is met.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `sz` is increased by 1 within the loop, we need to ensure that the new value of `sz` is considered.
   - The condition `sz >= k` determines when the loop exits, but we are only concerned with the state before the loop starts executing again.

Given that `sz` is increased by 1, and assuming that the loop continues as long as `sz < n`, the new value of `sz` will be `sz + 1`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `sng`, the variable `elem` will change with each iteration, but the sequence `sng` remains the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not indicated here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `sng` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
- `sz` is increased by 1 from its previous value.

Assuming the previous value of `sz` was `sz_prev`, the new value of `sz` will be `sz_prev + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`, `sz` is `sz_prev + 1`**.
