Output State: **`res` is `[1] * n` if `k` equals `n`, otherwise `res` is `range(n)` if `k` equals `1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns a value to the variable `res` based on the conditions involving `k` and `n`. If `k` is equal to `n`, `res` is assigned the list `[1] * n`, which creates a list of `n` ones. If `k` is equal to `1`, `res` is assigned `range(n)`, which creates a range object from `0` to `n-1`. Otherwise, `res` is assigned `[-1]`. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
