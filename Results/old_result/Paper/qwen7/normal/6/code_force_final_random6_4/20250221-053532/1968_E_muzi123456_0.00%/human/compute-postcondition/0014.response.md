Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, `i` is 1001, `n` is 1000.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`, and since the loop continues as long as `i <= n`, if the loop executes all 1000 iterations (as `n` is at least 1000), the final value of `i` will be `n + 1 - 1 = 1000`. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` remains unchanged (an integer between 0 and 49), `i` becomes 1001 (since it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, reaching up to but not including `n+1`), and `n` remains 1000 as it was initially set.
