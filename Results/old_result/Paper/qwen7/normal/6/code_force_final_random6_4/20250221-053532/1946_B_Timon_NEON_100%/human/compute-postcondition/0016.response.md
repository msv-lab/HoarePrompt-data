Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or `new_segment`, `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[new_segment + [i - 1]]`, and `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `new_segment = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `new_segment`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
