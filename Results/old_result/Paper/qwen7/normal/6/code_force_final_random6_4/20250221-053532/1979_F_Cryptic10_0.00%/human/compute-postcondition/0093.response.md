Output State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` anymore, `d` is -1, `v` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, `u` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, `n` is still greater than 0, and `path` now includes the value of `v` and the loop continues.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since the loop was already broken in the initial state, the `continue` statement here does not affect the loop's termination condition. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, and the loop continues.
