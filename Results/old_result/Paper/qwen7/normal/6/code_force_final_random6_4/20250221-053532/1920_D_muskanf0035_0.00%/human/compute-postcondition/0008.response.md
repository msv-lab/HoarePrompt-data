Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of input integers formed by splitting the input string and converting it to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `n` is updated to the first input integer, `q` is updated to the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, q = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)` and assigns them to `n` and `q` respectively. The initial conditions for `t`, `queries`, and `result` remain unchanged.
