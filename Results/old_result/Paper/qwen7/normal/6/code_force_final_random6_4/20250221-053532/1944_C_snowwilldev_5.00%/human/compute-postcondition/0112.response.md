Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is less than `N`, and if `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` is increased by 1; the current value of `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` equals 0, and `i` is incremented by 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since the loop or conditional block is not specified, we assume it is part of a loop or conditional structure where the conditions mentioned in the initial state are being checked. After executing the `break` statement, the loop or conditional block is exited, but the values of `t` and `i` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed. The postconditions related to `t` and `i` are still valid, and we indicate that we have broken out of the loop or conditional block.
