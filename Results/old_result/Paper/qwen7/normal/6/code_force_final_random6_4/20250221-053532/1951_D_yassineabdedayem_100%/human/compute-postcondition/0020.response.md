Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer equal to the first number entered.
   - `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered.
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, no changes are made.
   - Otherwise, if `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, `n` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to ensure `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes are made to `n` and `k`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - `n` and `k` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `t` is decreased by 1**.
