Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `sng`. After each iteration, `elem` will take the next element from `sng`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sz` is incremented by 1.
   - `sng` must have at least one more element.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `elem` is the variable being iterated over, it will be set to the next element in `sng`.
   - `sng` must still have at least one more element for the loop to continue.
   - `sz` will be incremented by 1 again for the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `sz` will be incremented by 1 again.
   - `sng` must still have at least one more element.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop (if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`) remains the same.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`sz` is incremented by 1, `sng` must have at least one more element, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

However, to clearly reflect the adjustment for the next iteration, we can specify the exact values for `sz` and the condition for `sng`:

State: **`sz` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `sng` must have at least one more element, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

For clarity, let's denote the value of `sz` at the end of the previous iteration as `sz_prev`. Then the new state would be:

State: **`sz` is `sz_prev + 1`, `sng` must have at least one more element, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
