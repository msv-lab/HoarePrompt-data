Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not fully address the requirements of the problem. Specifically:

1. **Handling Introverts and Extroverts Together**: The function `func_2` only considers the combination of extroverts and universals through `func_1`. However, it does not account for the fact that introverts need individual tents and cannot share with anyone. This means we need to ensure that the number of tents allocated to extroverts and universals does not leave any introverts without a place.

2. **Calculation of Tents**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals but does not consider the remaining introverts. If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it should still allocate a tent to the remaining extroverts, even if there are universals available to fill the tent.

3. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle cases where the number of extroverts and universals together is less than 3 when extroverts are not divisible by 3, which would make it impossible to form a group of 3 for those extroverts.

Here's a corrected version of the functions:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the number of full groups of 3 that can be formed
    full_groups = extroverts // 3
    # Remaining extroverts after forming full groups
    remaining_extroverts = extroverts % 3
    # Number of tents needed for full groups
    tents_for_full_groups = full_groups
    # Additional tent needed for remaining extroverts if they exist
    if remaining_extroverts > 0:
        tents_for_remaining_extroverts = 1
    else:
        tents_for_remaining_extroverts = 0
    # Tents needed for universals
    tents_for_universals = max(0, ceil((remaining_extroverts + universals) / 3))
    return tents_for_full_groups + tents_for_remaining_extroverts + tents_for_universals

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals
    tents_needed = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    # If the number of tents needed is greater than the number of introverts, it's impossible
    if tents_needed > introverts:
        return -1
    # Otherwise, add the number of tents needed for introverts
    return introverts + tents_needed
```

With these corrections, the solution should properly handle all edge cases and fulfill the problem requirements.
