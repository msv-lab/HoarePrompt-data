Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is not infinity, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `b` is not an empty list, the current value of `x` is less than `y`, `x` is less than `lit[0]`, and `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `y`. Additionally, `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.
