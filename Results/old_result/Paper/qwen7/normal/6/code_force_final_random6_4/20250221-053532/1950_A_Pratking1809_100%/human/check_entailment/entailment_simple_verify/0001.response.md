### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Stair Condition**: The condition `a < b < c` is correctly checked to determine if the digits form a stair.
   - **Peak Condition**: The condition `a < b > c` is correctly checked to determine if the digits form a peak.
   - **None Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program correctly prints "NONE".

However, there is a logical error in the condition checking for the peak. The condition `a < b > c` should be `a < b and b > c` to ensure both conditions are met simultaneously. The current condition `a < b > c` does not guarantee that `b` is greater than `c`.

For example, consider the input `3 6 4`. Here, `a < b` is true (3 < 6), but `b > c` is also true (6 > 4). However, the condition `a < b > c` evaluates to `True` because `6 > 4` is true, even though `b` is not the peak between `a` and `c`. This means the program incorrectly identifies this as a peak.

To fix this, the condition should be changed to `a < b and b > c`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment did not catch the logical error in the peak condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the flawed condition check for the peak.

**Final: False**
