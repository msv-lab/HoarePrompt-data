Output State: **`fnd` is the count of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k`, `D`, `E`, and `C` are as they are after the previous iteration, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D` after the previous iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers input from the user, and `nabors` is the number of iterations left to execute.**

The code reads three integers (`n`, `m`, and `k`) from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The other variables (`fnd`, `D`, `E`, `C`, `tot`, and `nabors`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
