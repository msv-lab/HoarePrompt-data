Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `t` is now 0.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, changing its range from \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) to \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\). The other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, the value of `t` is explicitly stated to be 0 after the operation.
