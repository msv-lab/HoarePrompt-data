Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 2 or 4 (depending on the value of `k`).
- `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element.
- `elem` is the next element of `rdb`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, because `end=' '` specifies that the default newline character should be replaced with a space.

Since `elem` is the next element of `rdb` and `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, `elem` must be the first element of `rdb`.

Therefore, the output will be the first element of `rdb` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is the first element of `rdb`)
