Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`, `i` is 0, `j` is len(lst), `sm` is (j - i + 1) ** 2**

Explanation: The code calculates `sm` using the formula `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `j` is `len(lst)`, the terms `sum(lst[:i])` and `sum(lst[j + 1:])` both evaluate to 0 because `i` is 0 and `j` is `len(lst)`, which means the slices are empty. Thus, `sm` is simply `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is `(len(lst) - 0 + 1) ** 2 = (len(lst) + 1) ** 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
