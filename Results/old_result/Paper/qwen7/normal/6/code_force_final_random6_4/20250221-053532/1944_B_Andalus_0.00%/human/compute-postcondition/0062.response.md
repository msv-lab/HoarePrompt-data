Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k + 2`, and the value of `k - sz` is less than or equal to -2**.

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 2. Since initially `sz` was greater than or equal to `k`, after adding 2, `sz` becomes greater than or equal to `k + 2`. Also, since `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, after `sz` increases by 2, `k - sz` becomes less than or equal to -2.
