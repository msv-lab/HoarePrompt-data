Postcondition: `fav` is an integer, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, and `k` is decreased by either the value at index `i_end + 1` of list `l` (if `fav` does not equal `l[i_end + 1]`) or twice that value (if `fav` equals `l[i_end + 1]`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
