Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ind` is 9
   - `i` is 7
   - `p[1]` is 1
   - `p[3]` is 3
   - `p[5]` is 5
   - `p[7]` is 7

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - This means `i` will take values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 7.
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value `i` will take is 8.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 7, the next value `i` will take is 8.
   - Therefore, `int(input())` must be greater than 8 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to adjust `i` to 8.
   - We do not need to adjust `ind` because it is not part of the loop head.
   - The values of `p` do not change within the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `ind` is 9, `i` is 8, `p[1]` is 1, `p[3]` is 3, `p[5]` is 5, `p[7]` is 7.**
