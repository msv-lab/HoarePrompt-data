Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is equal to \( k \), or if \( n + 2 \) is greater than \( 2k \). If either condition is met, it prints 'YES' followed by specific values. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
