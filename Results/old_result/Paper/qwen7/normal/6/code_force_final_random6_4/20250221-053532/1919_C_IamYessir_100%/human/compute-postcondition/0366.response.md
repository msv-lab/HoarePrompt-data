Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, if `a` is an empty list, `x` is not infinity, otherwise, `y` is assigned the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `y = b[-1]` attempts to assign the last element of list `b` to `y`. However, since `b` is not mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine its contents. Therefore, the only thing we know for sure is that `y` is now assigned the last element of whatever list `b` is, assuming `b` is a list. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
