Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The variable `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and for each index `j` from 0 to the maximum value in the list `a`, `r[j]` contains the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the list `a`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `r` will contain the count of how many times each index (from 0 to the maximum value in list `a`) appears in the list `a`. The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`, incrementing `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1 for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` is increased by 2. If the current value of `ul` equals `k * 2`, the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ul` is incremented by 2. If `ul` does not equal `k * 2`, the values of `i`, `n`, and `ul` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ul` is increased by 2. If `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 2, the values of `i`, `n`, and `ul` remain unchanged. We break out of the loop or block we were inside.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
