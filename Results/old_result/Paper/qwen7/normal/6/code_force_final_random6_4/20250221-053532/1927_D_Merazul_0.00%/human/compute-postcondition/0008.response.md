Output State: **`t` is 0, `k` is the second element returned by R(), `a` is a set containing the first element returned by R(), `b` is a set containing the elements returned by R(), `f` is 1, `m` is `k` // 2, `n` is `k` // 2**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `k // 2` to both `m` and `n`. Since `k` is the second element returned by `R()`, `m` and `n` are both set to `k // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
