Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-1 integers (excluding the first and last elements), `b` is less than or equal to 0, and no changes are made to `k`, `a`, `b`, or `nums`.
