Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is `i - 1`, `n` remains the same, and `mpp[i]` does not equal 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state reflects that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement without changing the values of `first`, `i`, `n`, and `mpp[i]`. The value of `i` is updated to `i - 1` as per the precondition, and the condition that `mpp[i]` does not equal 1 remains unchanged.
