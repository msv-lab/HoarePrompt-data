Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` can be any positive integer, `rdb` contains all the elements of `rgt` starting from index 1 up to `n-1` if they are repeated consecutively from the previous element, `sz` is 0, and the other variables (`ldb`, `sng`, `lft`, `rgt`) remain in their initial states or as described in the initial state condition.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is assigned the value 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `sng`, `lft`, or `rgt`. The loop's execution and the conditions related to `i` and `rdb` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still equal to `n`, `rdb` still contains the specified elements from `rgt`, and the other variables retain their initial states.
