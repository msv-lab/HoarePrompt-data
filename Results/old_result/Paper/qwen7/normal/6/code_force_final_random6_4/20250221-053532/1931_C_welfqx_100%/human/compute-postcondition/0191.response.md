Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - If the element at index `i` of array `num` is equal to the element at index `i + 1`, then `n` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the loop or conditional block is exited.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop continues; otherwise, it exits.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to consider the possible changes to `i` and `n` based on the loop condition.
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n - 1`, `i` must be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - `n` can either remain the same or increase by 1 depending on the condition inside the loop body.

5. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If the condition inside the loop body is met (i.e., `num[i] == num[i + 1]`), then `n` is increased by 1.
   - If the condition is not met, the loop exits.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` will either remain the same or increase by 1, but since we are considering the state just before the next iteration starts, we assume the worst-case scenario where `n` remains the same unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` must be less than `n - 1`, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

To provide a concrete example, let's assume the previous state was `i = 2` and `n = 5`. The new state would be:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
