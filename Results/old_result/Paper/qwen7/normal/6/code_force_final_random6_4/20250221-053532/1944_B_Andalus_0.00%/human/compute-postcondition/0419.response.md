Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - The initial condition given is that `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`.
   - There is a postcondition that if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` minus 2, then `sz` is adjusted such that it is exactly `k` minus 2.

2. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `rdb` using the variable `elem`.

3. **Loop Execution Impact**:
   - The loop itself does not directly modify `sz` based on the information provided. However, the postcondition needs to be considered for the next iteration.

4. **Postcondition Application**:
   - If `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k` minus 2, it should remain unchanged as per the postcondition.
   - If `sz` was less than `k` minus 2, the postcondition does not provide a specific adjustment, but rather maintains the condition that `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`.

5. **Next Iteration Consideration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sz` must still satisfy the condition of being an integer greater than or equal to `k`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `sz` is still an integer greater than or equal to `k`, and if it was initially greater than or equal to `k` minus 2, it should now be exactly `k` minus 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`, and if `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k` minus 2, it is now exactly `k` minus 2**.
