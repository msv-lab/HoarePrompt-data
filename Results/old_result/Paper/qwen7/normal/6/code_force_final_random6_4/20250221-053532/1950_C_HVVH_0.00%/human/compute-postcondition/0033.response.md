Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':', `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':`. If `h` equals 12, no change is made to the variables. Otherwise, `day` is set to 'AM'.
