Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two integers, `n` and `k`, with constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3. For each test case, the function determines and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
