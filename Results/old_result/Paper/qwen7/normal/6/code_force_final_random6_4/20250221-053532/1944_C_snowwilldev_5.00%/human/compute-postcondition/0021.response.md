Postcondition: `i` is `N-1`, `N` is an integer such that `i` remains within the range `[0, N-1]` during the loop execution, and if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is 1. If `cnt[i]` is not equal to 1, then no change is made to `t`. Additionally, either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0.
