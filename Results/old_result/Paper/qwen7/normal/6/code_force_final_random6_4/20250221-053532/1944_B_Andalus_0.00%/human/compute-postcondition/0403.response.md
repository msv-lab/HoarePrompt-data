Output State: **`sz` is `sz_prev + 2`, `sng` must have at least one more element, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` was initially `sz_prev + 1`. After executing `sz += 1`, the value of `sz` is now `sz_prev + 2`. The conditions regarding `sng` and the loop or if statement remain unchanged.
