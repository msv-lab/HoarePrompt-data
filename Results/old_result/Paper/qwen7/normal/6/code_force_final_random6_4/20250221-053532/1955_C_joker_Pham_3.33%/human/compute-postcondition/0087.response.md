Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1 or `r`, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 2` (or `r` remains as it was), and `sunks` is equal to 5 if `k >= a[r]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`.
