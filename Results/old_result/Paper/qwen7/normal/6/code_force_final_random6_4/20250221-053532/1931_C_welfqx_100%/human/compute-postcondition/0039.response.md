Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, and the first two elements of `num` are equal; `cn` is 1**.

The code `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. Since `cn` was initially not specified, it is assumed to be 0 in the context of this operation. After executing the code, `cn` becomes 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
