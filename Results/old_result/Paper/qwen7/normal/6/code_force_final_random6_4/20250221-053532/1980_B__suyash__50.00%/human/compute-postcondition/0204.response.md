Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This means that `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k` is `k - 2 * dic[l[i]]`: This means that `k` is updated by subtracting twice the value of `dic[l[i]]` from its current value. Here, `l[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `l`.

However, the print statement is simply printing the string `'MAYBE'`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `dic[l[i]]` do not affect this print statement because it does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **MAYBE**
