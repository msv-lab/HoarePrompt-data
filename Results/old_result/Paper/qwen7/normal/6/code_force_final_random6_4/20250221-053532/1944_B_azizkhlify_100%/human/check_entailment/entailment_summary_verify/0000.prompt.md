You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes an array `a` of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It derives values `n` and `k` from the array length and range respectively. The function prints pairs of identical numbers from the first half of the array `a` that appear exactly twice, followed by individual numbers from the second half of the array `a` that appear exactly once up to the required count `k`. After processing all test cases, it prints the elements stored in the list `res`, which contain the pairs and single occurrences printed during the execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the required arrays `l` and `r` for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. Here’s a counterexample to demonstrate this:

Consider the input:
```
2 1
1 2 2 1
```

According to the problem description, we need to find two arrays `l` and `r` each of length 2 such that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

The program outputs:
```
1 2
1 2
```

However, the bitwise XOR of `l = [1, 2]` is `1 ^ 2 = 3`, and the bitwise XOR of `r = [1, 2]` is also `1 ^ 2 = 3`. This particular case works correctly, but let's consider another case to show the flaw.

Consider the input:
```
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

The program outputs:
```
1 2
1 2
```

Here, the bitwise XOR of `l = [1, 2]` is `1 ^ 2 = 3`, and the bitwise XOR of `r = [1, 2]` is also `1 ^ 2 = 3`. Again, this case works correctly, but let's consider another specific case to highlight the issue.

Consider the input:
```
6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```

The program outputs:
```
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4
```

Here, the bitwise XOR of `l = [5, 1, 3, 3]` is `5 ^ 1 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 0`, and the bitwise XOR of `r = [6, 4, 2, 4]` is `6 ^ 4 ^ 2 ^ 4 = 0`. This case seems to work correctly, but the program does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of `l` will always equal the bitwise XOR of `r` for all possible inputs.

To ensure the correctness, the program needs to carefully select elements from both halves of the array to maintain the equality of bitwise XOR values. The current implementation does not guarantee this, hence it is incorrect.
