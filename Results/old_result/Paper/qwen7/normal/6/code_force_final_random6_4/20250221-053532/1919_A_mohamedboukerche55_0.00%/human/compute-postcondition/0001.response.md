Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), `s` is the string input by the user.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the string input by the user to the variable `s`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
