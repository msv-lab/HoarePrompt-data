Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ldb` is equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[2] != lft[1]` and `lft[2] != lft[3]` if `i` is 2, and `sng` contains the element `lft[2]` if `i` is 2, and `ldb` is equal to `lft[3]` and `lft[3] != lft[2]` and `lft[3] != lft[4]` if `i` is 3, and `sng` contains the element `lft[3]` if `i` is 3, `sng` now contains an additional element `lft[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Depending on whether `i` is 2 or 3, `lft[i]` will be either `lft[2]` or `lft[3]`. Since `sng` already contains one of these elements (either `lft[2]` or `lft[3]`), it now contains an additional element, making it contain both `lft[2]` and `lft[3]` if `i` is 2 or 3 respectively. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
