Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and `path` now includes the value of `v` minus one occurrence.**

Explanation: The line `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the value of `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. The other variables (`d`, `u`, and `path`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
