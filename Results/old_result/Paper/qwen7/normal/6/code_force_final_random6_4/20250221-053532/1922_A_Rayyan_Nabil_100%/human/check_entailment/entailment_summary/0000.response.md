Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if there exists a template such that two strings match it but a third string does not.
2. The provided solution uses `func_1` to check if there's a single character position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ from `c[i]`.
3. However, this approach is insufficient because it only checks if there's a single position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`, which does not guarantee that a template exists where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. For instance, if `a` and `b` are identical and do not match `c` in any position, `func_1` will return 'NO' even though a valid template might exist.
4. The correct approach would involve checking if for every character position, either both `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the lowercase version of `c[i]` or both do not match the lowercase version of `c[i]`, but `c[i]` itself is different from the lowercase version of `c[i]`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not fully capture the conditions required to determine the existence of a valid template.

Correctness: **False**
