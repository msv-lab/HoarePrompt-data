Output State: `i` is the length of `arr` - 1, `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to `i`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` and update `ans[i + 1]` as the sum of `ans[i]` and `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` is no longer less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. After all iterations, `i` will be the last index where the condition was satisfied, which is the length of `arr` minus one. At this point, `ans[i + 1]` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in `arr` up to index `i`.
