Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tot` is the sum of the values in `D.values()`, `bb` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0, `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` are fully exhausted, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` was also greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0 and `D[in_aa]` was less than or equal to `C[in_aa]`, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was 0, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object of the elements in `bb`, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D.values()`, `aa[m:]` must contain at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element, `D[out_aa]` is either decremented by 1 or remains greater than 0, if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, it is now `E[out_aa] - 1`; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, if `D[out_aa] <= -1`, then `D[out_aa]` remains less than or equal to -1, and `E[out_aa]` and `C[out_aa]` retain their original values, `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if it is greater than 0 and equals `D[in_aa]`, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` is less than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tot` is the sum of the values in `D.values()`, `aa[m:]` must contain at least two elements, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element, `D[out_aa]` is either decremented by 1 or remains greater than 0, if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, it is now `E[out_aa] - 1`; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, if `D[out_aa] <= -1`, then `D[out_aa]` remains less than or equal to -1, and `E[out_aa]` and `C[out_aa]` retain their original values, `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` is less than or equal to 0; `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; all other conditions and values remain the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
