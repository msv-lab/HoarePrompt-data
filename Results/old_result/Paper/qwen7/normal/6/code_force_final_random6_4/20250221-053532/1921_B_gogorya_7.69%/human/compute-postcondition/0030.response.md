Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `res` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `hd` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains valid. The variable `i` is also incremented by 1 as part of the loop condition mentioned in the initial state.
