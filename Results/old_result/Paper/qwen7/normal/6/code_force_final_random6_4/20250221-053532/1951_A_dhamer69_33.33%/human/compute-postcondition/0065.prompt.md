Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If `n` equals 2, `s` is either '00' or not '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, the count of '1's in `s` is either odd or even, and `s` either contains exactly one occurrence of '11' or does not contain exactly one occurrence of '11'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1's in the new input string `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1's in the new input string `s`. If `n == 2`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, `count_1` is calculated as the count of '1's in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the postcondition remains unchanged. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11', the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
