Output State: **`price_increase` is 0, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`, `price` is the smallest price popped from `pq`, `day` is the corresponding day of the smallest price popped from `pq`, `price` is increased by `price_increase`.**

The code `price += price_increase` increases the value of `price` by the value of `price_increase`. Since `price_increase` is 0, `price` remains unchanged. All other variables (`total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, `price`, and `day`) remain in their initial or previously determined states.
