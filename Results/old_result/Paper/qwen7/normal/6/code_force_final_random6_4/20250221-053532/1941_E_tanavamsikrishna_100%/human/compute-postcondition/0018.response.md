Output State: The `min_heap` is empty.

Explanation: Given that the loop continues to execute as long as there is an element in `min_heap` whose second value is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, and considering that the loop pops elements from `min_heap` until no more elements satisfy this condition, it follows that after all iterations of the loop have completed, `min_heap` will be empty. This means that either all elements in `min_heap` were removed because they satisfied the condition, or no elements remained in `min_heap` that met the condition.
