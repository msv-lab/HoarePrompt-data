Output State: **`k` must be non-zero, `arr` contains the integers `i` and `i+1`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `i` is increased by 1 before this line of code, `arr` now contains both the original value of `i` and the new value of `i` (which is `i+1`). The precondition that `k` must be non-zero and that `i` is increased by 1 remains unchanged.
