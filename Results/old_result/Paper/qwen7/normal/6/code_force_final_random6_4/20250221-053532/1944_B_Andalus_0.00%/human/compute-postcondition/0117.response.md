Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `elem`, `rdb`, and `k - sz`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `rdb`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sz` is 2.
   - `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.
   - The value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `rdb`, `elem` will take on the value of the current element in `rdb`.
   - After each iteration, `rdb` will lose one element because the loop processes one element per iteration.
   - The condition `k - sz` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop itself.

5. **New State**:
   - `sz` remains 2.
   - `rdb` loses one element, so it becomes a non-empty iterable with one less element.
   - `k - sz` remains greater than or equal to 2.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `rdb` has lost one element but still contains at least one element (since it was non-empty before and now has one less element).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sz` is 2, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element, and the value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2**.
