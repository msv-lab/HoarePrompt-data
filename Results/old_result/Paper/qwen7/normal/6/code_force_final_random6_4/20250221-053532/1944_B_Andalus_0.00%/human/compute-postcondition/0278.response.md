Output State: **`sz` is either 2 or 4 (depending on the value of `k`), `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, `elem` is the next element of `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of `sz`, `rdb`, or `elem`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The only effect is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was in.
