Output State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `res` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
