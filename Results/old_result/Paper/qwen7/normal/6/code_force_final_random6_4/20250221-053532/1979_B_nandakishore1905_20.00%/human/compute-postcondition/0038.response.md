Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix), `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2, `i` is `i_end + 1`, and `k` is updated to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then `q` remains 2. Otherwise, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**
