Postcondition: `new_segment` and `max_segment[0]` are updated based on the following conditions:
- If `arr[i] < 0`, then:
  - If `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` and `new_segment` is not empty, `segments_variants` contains either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` with `max_segment` equal to `new_segment`, and `new_segment` becomes an empty list.
  - If the condition `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` is false and `new_segment` is not empty, `new_segment` remains as `new_segment + [i - 1]` and `max_segment` remains unchanged.
  - If `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` becomes an empty list.
  - `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.
- If `arr[i] >= 0`, then `new_segment[0]` is updated to its previous value plus `arr[i]`, and `max_segment[0]` is updated to its previous value plus `arr[i]`.
