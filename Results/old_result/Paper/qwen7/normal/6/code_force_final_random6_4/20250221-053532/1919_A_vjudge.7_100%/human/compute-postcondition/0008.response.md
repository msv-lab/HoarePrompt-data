Output: **Alice**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, `test` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000. Variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are defined with specific conditions, but these do not affect the execution of the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string "Alice", regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`. Since no other information is needed to determine the output, the result is straightforward.
