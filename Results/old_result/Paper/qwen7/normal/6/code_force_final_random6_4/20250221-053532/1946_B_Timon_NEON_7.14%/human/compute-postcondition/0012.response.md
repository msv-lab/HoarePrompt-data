Postcondition: `segments_variants` is a list containing either ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] when the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`, or ['new_segment', 'i - 1'] when the first element of `max_segment` is not greater than the first element of `new_segment`. `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is updated to either ['max_segment[0]', 'max_segment[1]'] or ['new_segment[0]', 'new_segment[1]'], `max_sum` remains -1, `arr` has at least one element, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0.
