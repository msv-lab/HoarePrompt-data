Output State: `i` must be `i_prev + 3`, `d` remains the same, and the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be incremented by 3 from its initial value (`i_prev + 3`), while `d` remains unchanged. The condition for the loop to continue is still based on the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` being less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`.
