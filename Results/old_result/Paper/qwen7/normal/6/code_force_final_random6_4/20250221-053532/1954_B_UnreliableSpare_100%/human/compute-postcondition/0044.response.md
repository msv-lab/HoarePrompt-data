Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `flag` remains False, `ans` will hold the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, `val` will be the initial value of `arr[0]`, and `cnt` will be 0.**

Explanation: 
- The loop iterates over each index from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, if `arr[i]` equals `val`, `cnt` is incremented.
- If `arr[i]` does not equal `val`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.
- After all iterations, `i` will reach `n`, and `cnt` will be reset to 0 since it is reset every time `arr[i]` does not equal `val`. The final value of `ans` will be the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of `val` found during the loop.
