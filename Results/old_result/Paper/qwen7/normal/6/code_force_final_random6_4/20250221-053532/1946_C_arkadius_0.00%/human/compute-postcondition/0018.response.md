The loop condition is `beg < end`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `beg < end` must still hold true. Given the postconditions from the previous iteration:

- `beg` is an integer.
- `end` is greater than 1.
- `mid` is equal to (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2.

We need to ensure that `beg < end` remains true for the next iteration. The only way this can change is if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `False`, causing `end` to be updated to `mid - 1`. 

Let's break it down:

1. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`, then `beg` is set to `mid`. In this case, `beg` becomes `mid`, and since `mid` is calculated as (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2, `beg` would be less than `end` as long as `end` is greater than 1 (which is already given).

2. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `False`, then `end` is set to `mid - 1`. For the loop to continue, `beg` must still be less than `end`. This means `mid - 1` must be greater than `beg`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `end` is greater than `beg` for the next iteration. Since `end` is initially greater than 1 and `beg` is an integer, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `end` is greater than `beg`.

State: **`beg` is an integer, `end` is greater than `beg`, and `mid` is equal to (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2**
