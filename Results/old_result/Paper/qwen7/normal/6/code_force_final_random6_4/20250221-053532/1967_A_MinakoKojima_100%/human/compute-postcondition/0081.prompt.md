Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is the first element of the list `a`, `res` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `dif` retains its original value and is not 0, `ans` is increased by `dif` if `i` is 2, `k` is 0 if `i` is 1, `res` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is increased by `dif` if `i` is 3, `k` is 0 if `i` is 2, `res` is decreased by 3 if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 2 and then increased by `k % (i + 1)` if `i` is 3, `k` is now 0, and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is not 0, `res` is decreased by 3 if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 2 and then increased by `k % (i + 1)` if `i` is 3, `k` is now 0, and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `k` is 0, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`. If `dif` is not equal to 0, `res` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
