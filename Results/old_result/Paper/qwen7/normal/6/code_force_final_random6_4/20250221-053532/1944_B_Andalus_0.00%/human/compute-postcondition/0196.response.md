Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the state of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**: According to the given information, `i` is currently 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`. Since `i` is 1, the loop will continue if `n > 1`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration**: In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

5. **Adjust the state of `n`**: For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

6. **State the remaining variables**: The other variables (`sng`, `ldb`, `rgt`, `rdb`, `sz`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`) are not part of the loop head and their states remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `rgt` retains its state after the last iteration with the current value of `rgt[1]` being equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[0]`, `rdb` retains its state after the last iteration, `sz` retains its state after the last iteration, `k` retains its state after the last iteration, `lst` retains its state after the last iteration, `lft` retains its state after the last iteration.**
