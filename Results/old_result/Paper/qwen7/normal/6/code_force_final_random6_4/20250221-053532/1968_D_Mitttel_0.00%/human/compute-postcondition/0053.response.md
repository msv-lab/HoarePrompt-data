Output State: **`cycle_score` is increased by the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]`, `cycle_pos` is `cycle_pos + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]` updates `cycle_score` by adding the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` to it. It also increments `cycle_pos` by 1. The conditions that `steps` must still be greater than `cycle_start` and `cycle_pos` must still be a valid index remain unchanged.
