Postcondition: `i` is 4, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, `k` is either `-dif * 5` or 0, `res` is either -2 or 0, `ans` is either `ans + (a[5] - a[4])` or 0, and `n` must be greater than 4. If `k` is 0, the loop or statement is exited, and `res` and `ans` remain unchanged or `ans` is incremented by `a[5] - a[4]` if `k` is 0.
