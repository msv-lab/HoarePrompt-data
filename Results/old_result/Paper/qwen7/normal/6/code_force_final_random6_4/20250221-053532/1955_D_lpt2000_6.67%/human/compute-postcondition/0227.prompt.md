Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `nabors` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                C[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                D[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until there are no more elements in the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`. After all iterations, `fnd` will be the total number of times `tot` (the sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k`. The values of `D`, `E`, and `C` will be modified according to the conditions within the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, if `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` is also greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` will be decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` will be increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0 but `E[out_aa]` is not, `D[out_aa]` will be decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` will be increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` will be decreased by 1. For `in_aa`, if `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0 and equals `D[in_aa]`, `C[in_aa]` will be increased by 1; otherwise, `D[in_aa]` will be increased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, `E[in_aa]` will be increased by 1. `tot` will be updated as the sum of the values in `D` after each iteration.

In summary, after all iterations, `fnd` will count how many times `tot` meets the condition of being greater than or equal to `k`, and the dictionaries `D`, `E`, and `C` will reflect the cumulative changes made during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `fnd` is incremented by 1 each time `tot` (the sum of the values in `D.values()`) is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `tot` is the final sum of the values in `D.values()` after all iterations; `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` are fully exhausted; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` was also greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0; `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0 and `D[in_aa]` was less than or equal to `C[in_aa]`; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was 0.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `fnd` will be the total number of times `tot` met or exceeded `k`. The values of `tot`, `D`, `E`, `C`, and the lists `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` will reflect the cumulative effects of the operations performed within the loop on the counters and the elements of the lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` are exhausted, `fnd` is incremented by the number of times `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations, `tot` is the final sum of the values in `D.values()`, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` was also greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0 and `D[in_aa]` was less than or equal to `C[in_aa]`, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was 0, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
