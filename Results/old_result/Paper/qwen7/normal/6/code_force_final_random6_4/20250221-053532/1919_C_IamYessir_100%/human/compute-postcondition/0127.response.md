Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[3]`, then `b` has an additional element which is `a[3]`. Otherwise, `a` is a list with its last element being `a[3]`.
