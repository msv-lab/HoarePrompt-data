### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires minimizing the total cost of buying `k` tickets over `n` days, where the price of tickets increases based on the number of tickets bought on any given day.
   - The solution uses a min-heap to always consider the cheapest available ticket price and iteratively buys tickets starting from the cheapest price.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost of buying `k` tickets.
   - In `func_1`, a priority queue (min-heap) is used to always consider the cheapest available ticket price.
   - The algorithm iteratively buys tickets starting from the cheapest available price, updating the price increase and total cost accordingly.
   - The logic to calculate the number of tickets to buy each day (`min(m, k - tickets_bought)`) ensures that the maximum allowed tickets per day are bought unless fewer are needed to reach `k`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the algorithm always considers the lowest possible price for the next ticket purchase.
   - The logic for updating the price increase after each purchase is correctly implemented.
   - The overall structure of the algorithm matches the problem requirements and examples provided.

4. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations**:
   - **Initial State**: `n` is the number of sale days, `m` is the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is the number of tickets to be bought, and `prices` is a list of ticket prices for each day.
   - **Heap Initialization**: A min-heap is created using the ticket prices and their indices.
   - **Loop Execution**: The loop continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`. In each iteration:
     - The cheapest ticket price is dequeued from the heap.
     - The price is adjusted by adding the current `price_increase`.
     - The number of tickets to buy is determined as `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.
     - The total cost is updated by adding the product of the adjusted price and the number of tickets to buy.
     - The number of tickets bought and `price_increase` are updated accordingly.
   - **Final State**: After the loop, `total_cost` holds the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets, and `price_increase` reflects the total increase in price due to previous purchases.

Given this detailed evaluation, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
