Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string from the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, and `s` is the new input string.**

In this case, the code updates the value of `x` to be the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` depends on the content of the new string `s`, but since the exact string is not provided, we express `x` as the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
