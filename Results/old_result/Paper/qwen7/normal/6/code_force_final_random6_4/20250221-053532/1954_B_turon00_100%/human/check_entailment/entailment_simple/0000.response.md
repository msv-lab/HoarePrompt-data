Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array `a` and `cnt` to 0 to count consecutive occurrences of `tmp`.
4. It iterates through the array `a` and updates `cnt` when consecutive elements match `tmp`. When a non-matching element is encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
5. After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to ensure the final count is considered.
6. It checks if the array has only one element or if the minimum count of consecutive occurrences (`ans`) equals the size of the array (`n`). If either condition is true, it prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.
7. The state description at the end of the program matches the expected behavior after processing all test cases.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and constraints, and the provided example outputs are consistent with the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
