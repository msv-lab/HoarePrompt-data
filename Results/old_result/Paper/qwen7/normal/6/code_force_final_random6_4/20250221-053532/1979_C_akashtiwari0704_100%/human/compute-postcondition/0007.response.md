Output State: **`t` is 0, `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Initially, `g` is `l[0]`, and `i` is 1. So, `g` is updated to `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables (`t` and `l`) remain unchanged.
