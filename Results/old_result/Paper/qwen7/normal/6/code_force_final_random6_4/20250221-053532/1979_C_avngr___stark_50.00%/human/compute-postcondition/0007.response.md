Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop starts from `numbers[1:]`, meaning it iterates over all elements of `numbers` starting from the second element.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `hcf` is updated to `gcd(hcf, the third element of the list numbers)`.
   - This means that before the current iteration, `hcf` was updated using the third element of `numbers`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will now use the fourth element of `numbers` (since it starts from the second element).
   - `hcf` will be updated to `gcd(hcf, the fourth element of the list numbers)`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `hcf` remains the same as it was updated in the previous iteration.
   - `num` will be the fourth element of `numbers`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that there must be at least four elements in `numbers`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`hcf` is the value it was updated to in the previous iteration, `num` is the fourth element of the list `numbers`, and `numbers` must have at least four elements**.
