You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, …, k_n where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: The greatest common factor (`hcf`) of all the elements in the list `numbers`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
    #
    #Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, the variable `hcf` will hold the greatest common factor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `numbers`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `hcf` to be the GCD of `hcf` and each subsequent element in the list. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common factor (GCD) of all the elements in the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers named 'numbers'. It calculates and returns the greatest common factor (GCD) of all the elements in the list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the greatest common factor (GCD) of all the elements in the list 'numbers'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
