Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be `n`, `a` and `b` will be swapped compared to their initial values after the last iteration, and `c` will be incremented by `n-2` (since the loop runs `n` times and `c` is incremented each time).**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop:
- The variable `x` will be `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variables `a` and `b` will be swapped compared to their state after the last iteration of the loop. This swapping occurs because the loop continues to swap `a` and `b` as long as `a` is greater than `b`.
- The variable `c` will be incremented by `n-2` because the loop increments `c` in every iteration, and it runs `n` times in total. Therefore, `c` starts from 0 and ends up being `n-2` after all iterations.
