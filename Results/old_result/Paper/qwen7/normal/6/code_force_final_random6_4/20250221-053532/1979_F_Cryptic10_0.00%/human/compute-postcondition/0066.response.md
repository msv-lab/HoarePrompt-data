Output State: **`d` is `n - 3`, `v` has been removed from `path`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where the code was originally placed. The values of `d`, `u`, and the modification to `path` remain unchanged, and we simply indicate that the loop or conditional block has been exited.
