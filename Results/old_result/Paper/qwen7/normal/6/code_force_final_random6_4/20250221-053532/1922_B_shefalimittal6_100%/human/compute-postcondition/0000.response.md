Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, the function `input = sys.stdin.read` is assigned to read input from stdin.**

The code replaces the standard input reading method with `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input as a single string. However, it does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the constraints and types of these variables remain the same.
