Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is the first element of `res`.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of the list `res`.

Since `res` contains at least one element and `i` is explicitly stated to be the first element of `res`, the print statement will output this first element.

Output: **the first element of res**
