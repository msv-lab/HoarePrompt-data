Output State: **`ans` is either 2 or 3, `sm` is `k` + 2, `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 1`, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1 from its previous value, and if `(ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]])` is true, then `ans` is 2 and `sm` is `k` + 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 2 and `sm` remains `k` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `sm += 1` increments the value of `sm` by 1. Since `sm` was initially either `k` or `k + 1`, after executing the code, `sm` becomes `k + 1` or `k + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
