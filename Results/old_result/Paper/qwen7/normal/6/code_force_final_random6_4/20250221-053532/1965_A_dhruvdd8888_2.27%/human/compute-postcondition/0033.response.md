Output State: The loop will continue executing as long as the difference between consecutive elements in the `nums` list is 1. After all iterations, if the difference between every pair of consecutive elements (from the start until the second last element) is 1, then `cd` will be equal to the number of such pairs. If at any point the difference is not 1, the loop will break and `cd` will be the count of consecutive 1 differences encountered up to that point.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:

- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3 and the first element is 0.
- `cd` is the count of consecutive integer differences of 1 from the first element to the second last element in the list. If the differences are not consistently 1, `cd` will be the count up to the point where the difference is no longer 1.
