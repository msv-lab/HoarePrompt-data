Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as the list `a` is not empty (`a`) and the first element of `a` is `0` (`a[0] == 0`).

2. **Current State**: 
   - `res` is 0 (this state is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `_` is 0 (this state is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is an input integer (this state is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - The first element of `a` has been removed.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must not be empty and `a[0]` must be `0`.
   - Since the first element of `a` was removed in the previous iteration, `a` is now one element shorter.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `a` must still be non-empty and the new first element of `a` must be `0`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `a` must not be empty, so it must have at least one element left.
   - The first element of `a` must be `0`.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `a` is non-empty and the first element of `a` is `0`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, the first element of `a` must be 0 and `a` must not be empty**
