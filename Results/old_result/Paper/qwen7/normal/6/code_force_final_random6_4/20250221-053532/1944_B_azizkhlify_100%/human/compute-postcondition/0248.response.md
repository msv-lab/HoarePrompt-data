Output State: **`i` is the sixth element from `res`, `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`, and `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`; `ur` is increased by 2, and `ul` equals `ur`.**

Explanation: The variable `ur` is incremented by 2, making it `ur + 2`. Since `ul` was previously equal to `ur`, `ul` also becomes `ur + 2`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
