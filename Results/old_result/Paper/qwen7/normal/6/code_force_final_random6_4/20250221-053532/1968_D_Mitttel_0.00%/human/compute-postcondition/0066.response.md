Output State: **`full_cycles` remains unchanged, `remaining_steps` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is decreased by 1, `score` is increased by `a[current_pos - 1]`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `current_pos` is updated to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`**

This means that the `current_pos` variable is updated to the value stored in `p[current_pos - 1]`. All other variables (`full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `remainder_steps`, `score`, and `cycle_score`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
