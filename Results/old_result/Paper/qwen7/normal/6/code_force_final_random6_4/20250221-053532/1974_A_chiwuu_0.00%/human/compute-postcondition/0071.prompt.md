You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b * 2
        
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `t` after the loop executes all its iterations is determined by the cumulative effect of the operations performed within each iteration. Specifically, for each iteration, the value of `t` is updated based on the conditions provided. After all iterations, `t` will be the sum of the adjustments made during each iteration, starting from the initial value of `t` (which is `b * 2`), and modified by the logic inside the loop. Each iteration updates `t` based on the inputs `a` and `b` provided by the user, and the final value of `t` will reflect the total accumulated changes across all iterations.
    #
    #The exact final value of `t` cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific values of `a` and `b` for each iteration, but it will be the result of repeatedly applying the logic described in the loop, starting from `t = b * 2` and adjusting `t` based on the conditions given.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
