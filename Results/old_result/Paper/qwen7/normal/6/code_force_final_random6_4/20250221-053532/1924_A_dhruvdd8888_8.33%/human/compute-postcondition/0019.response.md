Output State: **`i` is the second character of the string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing the element `i`, `win` is a set that now contains `i`, `ps` is 1.**

The code `ps += 1` increments the value of `ps` by 1. Since `ps` was not defined before this line, it is assumed to be initialized to 0. After the increment, `ps` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
