Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the lack of any input parameters in the function definition, it implies that the function does not take any arguments. The functionality described in the output indicates that the function processes some external data (test cases) where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers within specified ranges. However, since the function itself does not accept any parameters, the description of the function's behavior should reflect that it does not take any inputs and thus does not return anything.
