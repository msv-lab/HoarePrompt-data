Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`. The loop runs from `1` to `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that `x` satisfies the conditions `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i**2 == 0)` and `i * (i - 1) % i**2 == 0`. This means `i` was the value it ended on in the previous iteration.

3. **Update the state of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `b`.

5. **Adjust the other states**: The other states (`t`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, and `x`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not provided here.

Given the above steps, let's update the state:

- `t` remains `0`.
- `a` remains `int(info[0])`.
- `b` must still be at least 1.
- `suma` remains as it was.
- `x` remains as it was.
- `i` is updated to `i + 1`.

Since `i` was the value it ended on in the previous iteration, let's denote it as `i_end`. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

**State:**
- `t` is `0`.
- `a` is `int(info[0])`.
- `b` must be at least 1.
- `suma` is either `x` + 1 or remains `suma`.
- `x` is `(a - (i_end + 1) * ((i_end + 1) - 1)) // (i_end + 1)`.
- The current value of `x` must satisfy `((a - (i_end + 1) * ((i_end + 1) - 1)) % (i_end + 1)**2 == 0)` and `(i_end + 1) * ((i_end + 1) - 1) % (i_end + 1)**2 == 0`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`t` is 0, `a` is int(info[0]), `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is either x + 1 or remains suma, `x` is (a - (i_end + 1) * ((i_end + 1) - 1)) // (i_end + 1), and the current value of x satisfies ((a - (i_end + 1) * ((i_end + 1) - 1)) % (i_end + 1)**2 == 0) and (i_end + 1) * ((i_end + 1) - 1) % (i_end + 1)**2 == 0**.
