You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `t` times. After all iterations, the variable `i` will have the value of `t-1`, `n` will be the integer from the last input provided during the loop's execution, and `k` will be the second integer from the last input provided during the loop's execution. The value of `t` will remain as it was initially provided and must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 676.
    #
    #This means that if the loop runs `t` times, the final state of the loop will show that `i` has reached `t-1`, and the values of `n` and `k` will be those of the last input pair processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three integers: t, n, and k, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. Based on these values, the function returns either an error message indicating that t is out of range or a result depending on the relationship between n and k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
