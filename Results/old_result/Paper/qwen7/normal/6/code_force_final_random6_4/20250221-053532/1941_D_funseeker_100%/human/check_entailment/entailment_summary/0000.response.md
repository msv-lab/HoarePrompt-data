Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the possible positions of a ball after a series of throws between players standing in a circle. The throws can be either clockwise or counterclockwise, and the direction might be unknown for some throws.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - **func_2()**: Reads the number of test cases from the input.
   - **func_3()**: Reads and returns a list of integers from the input.
   - **func_4()**: This function processes the data for each test case. It initializes the starting position of the ball and iteratively updates the possible positions based on the provided distances and directions. It handles both clockwise and counterclockwise movements correctly, even when the direction is unknown ('?').

3. **Function_4 Behavior**:
   - It starts by initializing the set `ans` with the initial position `x`.
   - For each throw, it splits the input to get the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then updates the set `temp` with the new possible positions based on the direction. If the direction is unknown ('?'), both possible positions (clockwise and counterclockwise) are added.
   - After processing all throws, it ensures that position `0` is replaced with position `n` if it exists in the set.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique possible positions and their sorted values.

4. **Validation**:
   - The logic in `func_4` correctly handles all edge cases, including unknown directions ('?').
   - The use of sets ensures that only unique positions are considered.
   - The modulo operation `% n` correctly wraps around the circular nature of the players' positions.
   - The handling of position `0` by replacing it with `n` is correct and ensures the positions are within the valid range `[1, n]`.

Given the detailed analysis, the function `func_4` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
