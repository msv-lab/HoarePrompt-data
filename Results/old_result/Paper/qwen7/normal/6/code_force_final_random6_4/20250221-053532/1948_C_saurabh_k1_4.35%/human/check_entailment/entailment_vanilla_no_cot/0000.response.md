Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The logic in the solution only checks the second-to-last column's direction in the second row and makes a decision based on that. This is insufficient because the robot's path depends on the sequence of arrows in both rows, not just the last few columns.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n). Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(input())  # First row
        b = list(input())  # Second row
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        x, y = 0, 0  # Start at (1, 1)
        while True:
            # Move to the next cell based on the current position
            if x == 0 and y < n - 1 and a[y] == '>':
                y += 1
            elif x == 1 and y > 0 and b[y - 1] == '<':
                y -= 1
            elif x == 0 and y > 0 and a[y - 1] == '<':
                y -= 1
            elif x == 1 and y < n - 1 and b[y] == '>':
                y += 1
            
            # Check if we have reached the target cell
            if x == 1 and y == n - 1:
                print('YES')
                break
            
            # If we hit a dead end, break the loop
            if x == 0 and y == 0 or x == 1 and y == n - 2:
                print('NO')
                break

func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the robot's movement through the grid and checks if it can reach the target cell (2, n).
