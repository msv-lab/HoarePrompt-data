Output State: **`count` is 4; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `n / 4`.**

The code `g = n / count` assigns the value of `n / 4` to the variable `g`. The initial values of `count` and `countmins` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value for `g` based on the division of `n` by `count`, which is 4.
