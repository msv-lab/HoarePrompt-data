Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program only sums the top two largest numbers from the sorted list and prints that sum. However, the problem requires dividing the books into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the maximum books from each pile is maximized. 

The given solution does not consider all possible ways to divide the books into two piles and may not always yield the maximum possible sum. For example, in the second test case, the correct answer should be 5 (by putting books 2 and 3 in one pile and books 1 and 4 in another), but the program would incorrectly output 4.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider all possible ways to split the books into two piles and calculate the sum of the maximum books from each pile for each split, then return the maximum sum found.
