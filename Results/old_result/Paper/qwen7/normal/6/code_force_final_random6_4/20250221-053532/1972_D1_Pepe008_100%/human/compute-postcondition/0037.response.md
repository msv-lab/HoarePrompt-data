Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the final value after the loop completes, `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated within the loop plus additional increments based on the specified conditions, `info` is a list of strings split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `suma`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged, and `info` now holds the list of strings obtained from the input.
