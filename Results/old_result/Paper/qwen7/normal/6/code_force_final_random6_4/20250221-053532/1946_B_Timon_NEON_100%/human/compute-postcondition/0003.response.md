Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9], `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `max_sum` to -1, which is a specific value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
