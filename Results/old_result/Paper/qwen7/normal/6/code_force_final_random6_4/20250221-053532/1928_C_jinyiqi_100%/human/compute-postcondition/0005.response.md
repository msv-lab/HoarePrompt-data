Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing `[1]`, `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 2)]`, and `x % i` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `int(x / i)` to `output2`. Given that `i` is 2, `output2.append(int(x / 2))` adds the integer division of `x` by `2` to `output2`. Since `x % i` equals 0, it confirms that `x` is divisible by `2`, making the appended value `int(x / 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
