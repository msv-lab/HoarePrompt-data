Output State: **`monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple; `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`; `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `bullets_used + health` to the variable `total_bullets_needed`. Since `bullets_used` and `health` are not defined in the initial state, `total_bullets_needed` is expressed as the sum of these two variables. The lists `monsters` and the value of `distance` remain unchanged.
