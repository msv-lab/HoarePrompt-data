Output State: **`i` is 7, `dif` is not 0, `res` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is `k - dif * 8`**

Explanation: 
- The initial state had `i` as 7, `dif` not equal to 0, `res` decreased by 1, and `ans` increased by `dif`.
- The code `k -= dif * (i + 1)` updates `k` by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from its current value. Since `i` is 7, this becomes `k -= dif * 8`.
- The values of `i`, `dif`, `res`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `res` is still decreased by 1, and `ans` is still increased by `dif`.
- The updated state for `k` is `k - dif * 8`.
