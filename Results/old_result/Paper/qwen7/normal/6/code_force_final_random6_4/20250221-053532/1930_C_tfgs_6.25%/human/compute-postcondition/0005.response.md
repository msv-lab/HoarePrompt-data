Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a[1]` is 3**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] + 1 + 1`, which results in `a[1]` being 3. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
