Output State: **`index` is 18 + n + n, `PB` is an integer value from `data[5]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `PS` is an integer value from `data[8]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after this line, it contains one element, which is the return value of the function call. All other variables retain their initial states.
