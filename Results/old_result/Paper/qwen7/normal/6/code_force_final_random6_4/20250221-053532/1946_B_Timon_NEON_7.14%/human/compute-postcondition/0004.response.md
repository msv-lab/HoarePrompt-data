Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `arr`. The variable `segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum` are not part of the loop head.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(len(arr))` expression.
   - `arr` is a list whose length determines the number of iterations in the loop.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element (i.e., `len(arr)` must be greater than 0).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1, `arr` must have at least one element**
