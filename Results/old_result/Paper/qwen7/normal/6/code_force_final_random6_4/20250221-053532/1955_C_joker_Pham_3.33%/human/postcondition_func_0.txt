The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and `a` (a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range n). It iterates through the list `a` and performs operations based on the value of `k`, counting the number of valid operations. The function returns the total count of these valid operations, denoted as `sunks`, which can range from 0 to a maximum based on the initial conditions and the value of `k`.
