Postcondition: `ii` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `num` is a list or array, `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from index 0 up to `n-2`, and either `ck` is increased by 1 if the elements at indices `ii` and `ii + 1` are consecutive identical elements, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if they are not.
