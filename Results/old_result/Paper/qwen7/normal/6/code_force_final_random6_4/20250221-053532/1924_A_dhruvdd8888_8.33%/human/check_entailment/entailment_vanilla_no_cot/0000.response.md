Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` is never called correctly**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called properly within the loop. Instead of calling `func_1`, the program should process each test case directly.

2. **Random Number Generation**: The line `rrr = randint(8888, 88888)` is unnecessary and does not serve any purpose in the context of the problem. It can be removed.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Subsequences**: The logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s` is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the first `k` characters appear in `s` and does not ensure that all possible combinations of these characters form a subsequence.

4. **Printing the Result**: The program prints a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence only when `ps < n`. However, this logic is insufficient to cover all cases where a valid string of length `n` might not be a subsequence.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    all_possible_strings = set([''.join(p) for p in itertools.product(us, repeat=n)])
    
    found_strings = set()
    for i in range(m - n + 1):
        if all(c in us for c in s[i:i+n]):
            found_strings.add(s[i:i+n])
    
    if all_possible_strings.issubset(found_strings):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        missing_string = ''.join(next(itertools.product(us, repeat=n)) - found_strings)
        print(missing_string)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version uses `itertools.product` to generate all possible strings of length `n` from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then checks if all these strings are present as subsequences in the given string `s`. If not, it prints 'NO' and a missing string.
