Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to 0 and `r` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `r` is updated to `n - 1`.**
