### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row of the river, given the maximum distance `d` between supports.

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by setting the first element of the row to 1 (since a support must be installed at the start).
2. **Initial Cost Calculation**: For the first `d` elements, it adds 2 to each element (since the cost is `a_{i,j} + 1` and we add 1 initially, so we add another 1 here).
3. **Heap Initialization**: A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost up to the current position.
4. **Cost Update Loop**: For each subsequent element, it removes the oldest element from the heap (which is no longer within the required distance `d`) and updates the current element's cost based on the minimum cost found in the heap plus the current element's depth plus 1.

However, there are several issues with this implementation:

- **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The function does not correctly handle the optimal placement of supports to minimize the total cost. The way it updates the heap and the cost calculation might not guarantee the minimum cost.
- **Heap Usage**: The heap is used to find the minimum cost within the last `d` elements, but it does not ensure that the supports are placed optimally across the entire row.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis

The function `func_2` is responsible for processing the input and calculating the total cost for multiple rows.

1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the dimensions and the river depths from the input.
2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row**: It calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimum cost of installing supports.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

Given the issues in `func_1`, the overall logic in `func_2` is flawed because it relies on an incorrect cost calculation for individual rows.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. The `func_1` function does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the given constraints, leading to incorrect results.

**Final: False**
