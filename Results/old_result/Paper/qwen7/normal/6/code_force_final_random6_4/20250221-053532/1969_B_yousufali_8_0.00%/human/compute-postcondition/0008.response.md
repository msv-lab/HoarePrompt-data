The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a binary string `s` is provided, where the length of `s` is between 2 and 200,000, and `s` consists only of '0' and '1'. The function does not return a specific value directly but processes `t` test cases, each involving a binary string `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to process `t` test cases, where each test case involves a binary string `s`, and perform some operation or check on each string `s`.
