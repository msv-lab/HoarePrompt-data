Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it is an empty list, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty, otherwise it is `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, otherwise it is an empty list, and `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `max_segment[0]` by adding `arr[i]` to it. This means that `max_segment[0]` is now `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, except for `max_segment[0]` which is updated. The conditions for `new_segment` and `segments_variants` also remain the same as they depend on the value of `arr[i]` and whether `new_segment` is empty or not.
