Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]`, `n` is greater than 1, `rgt` is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Since `lft` is sorted in ascending order and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` now contains the element `lft[i]`. The value of `i` is also incremented by 1 due to the nature of the loop or sequence of operations that this line is part of. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
