Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here’s why:

1. **Case for `k == n`:**
   - When `k == n`, every cyclic shift must be sorted. This means the array itself must be sorted. The current solution uses `[1] * n` which will only work if all elements are 1. However, it doesn't handle cases where the array can contain different values but still be sorted in all cyclic shifts.

2. **Case for `k == 1`:**
   - When `k == 1`, only one cyclic shift must be sorted. The current solution uses `range(n)` which generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`. This won't necessarily result in exactly one sorted cyclic shift. For example, with `n=3` and `k=1`, the sequence `[0, 1, 2]` has three sorted cyclic shifts: `[0, 1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 0]`, and `[2, 0, 1]`.

3. **Case for `k < n` and `k > 1`:**
   - The current solution uses `[-1]` for this case, which is incorrect because it doesn’t provide a valid array that meets the criteria.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to generate an array that meets the specific conditions for `k` sorted cyclic shifts. One approach is to create a partially sorted array with some elements repeated in a way that ensures exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k == n:
            # All cyclic shifts must be sorted
            print(*[1] * n)
        elif k == 1:
            # Only one cyclic shift must be sorted
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        else:
            # Generate an array with exactly k sorted cyclic shifts
            arr = [1] * n
            for i in range(k):
                arr[i] = 10**9
            print(*arr)

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
- If `k == n`, all elements are set to 1.
- If `k == 1`, the array is generated such that only the first cyclic shift is sorted.
- For other cases, the array is mostly filled with 1s, and `k` elements are set to a large value (`10^9`) to ensure exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.
