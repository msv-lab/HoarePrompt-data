Output State: `end` is increased by 7 for each iteration, so it will be increased by 21 in total, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with the condition that consecutive elements in the list are equal until the end of the list, `l` is equal to `l + 3` (since it increments by 1 each time the loop runs), `r` must be greater than `l`, and `st` is equal to `st + 2 * 3 = 6`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `end` will have been increased by 21, `n` must still be greater than 1, `a` must be a list where consecutive elements are equal until the end, `l` will be 3 more than its initial value, `r` must still be greater than `l`, and `st` will be 6.
