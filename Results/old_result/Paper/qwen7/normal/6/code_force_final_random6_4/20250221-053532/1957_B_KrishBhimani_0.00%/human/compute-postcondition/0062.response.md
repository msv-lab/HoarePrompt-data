Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split; `n` is the first integer from `l1`; `k` is the second integer from `l1` and is currently odd; `k0` is equal to `k`; `arr` is a list containing the integer 0; `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16]; `c` is 5.**

The code `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
