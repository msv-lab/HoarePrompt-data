Output State: **`i` is 2, `cnt` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 1 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, so if `cnt` was initially 0 or 1, it will now be 1 or 2 respectively. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged. The condition for updating `ans` based on `a[1]` and `tmp` also remains the same.
