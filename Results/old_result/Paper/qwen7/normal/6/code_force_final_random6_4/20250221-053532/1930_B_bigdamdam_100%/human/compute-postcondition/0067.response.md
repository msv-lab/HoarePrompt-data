Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `range(0, n, 2)`, meaning `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 until it reaches a value less than `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p[i+2]` is assigned the value of `ind - 4`.
   - `i` is updated to `i + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.
   - `ind` is updated to `ind - 2`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 2, the new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus 2.
   - The new value of `ind` will be the old value of `ind` minus 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i + 2`.

Given the previous iteration's state:
- `p[i+2]` is assigned the value of `ind - 4`.
- `i` is `i + 2`.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.
- `ind` is `ind - 2`.

For the next iteration:
- The new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus 2.
- The new value of `ind` will be the old value of `ind` minus 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than the new value of `i + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `p[i+2]` is assigned the value of `ind - 4`.
- `i` is `i + 4` (since `i` was already `i + 2`).
- `n` must be greater than `i + 4` (since `i` is now `i + 4`).
- `ind` is `ind - 2`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`p[i+2]` is assigned the value of `ind - 4`, `i` is `i + 4`, `n` must be greater than `i + 4`, and `ind` is `ind - 2`**.
