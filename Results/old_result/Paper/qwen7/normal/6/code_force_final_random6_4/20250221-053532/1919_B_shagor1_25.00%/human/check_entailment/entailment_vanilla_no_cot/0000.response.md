Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Instead, it calculates a simple difference between the number of '-' and '+' characters in the string, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should consider different ways to split the array and calculate the penalties for those splits to find the minimum possible penalty. The current implementation does not achieve this.
