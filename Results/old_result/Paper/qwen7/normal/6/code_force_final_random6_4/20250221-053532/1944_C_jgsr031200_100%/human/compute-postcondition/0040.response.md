Output State: **`cou` is 3, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and if `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The value of `cou` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition for the loop continues to apply, specifically that if `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will continue to the next iteration.
