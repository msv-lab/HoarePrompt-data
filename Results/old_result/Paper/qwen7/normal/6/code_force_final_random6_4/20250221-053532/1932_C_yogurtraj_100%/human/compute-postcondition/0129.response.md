Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is decreased by 1.**

The code `q1 -= 1` decreases the value of `q1` by 1. Since `i` is -1, `n` must be at least 1, and `k` is defined as `k * a[q1] % m`, these conditions remain unchanged except for `q1`, which is now one less than its original value.
