Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and the input value used to determine the range.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
   - `c` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the input value (which is an integer read from the user).

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` remains unchanged, it will still be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The input value used to determine the range will be decremented by 1 because `i` has just completed one iteration.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- The input value used to determine the range is now one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `c` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, the input value used to determine the range is one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration**.
