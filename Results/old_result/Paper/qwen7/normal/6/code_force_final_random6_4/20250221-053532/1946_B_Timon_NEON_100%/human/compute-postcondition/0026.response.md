Postcondition: `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is [arr[i], i] if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` remains unchanged as [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, and the value of `i` is equal to the length of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, no changes are made to the variables.
