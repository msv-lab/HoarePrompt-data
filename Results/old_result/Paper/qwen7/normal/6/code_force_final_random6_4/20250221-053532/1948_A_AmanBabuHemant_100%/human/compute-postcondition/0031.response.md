Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state defines that `t` is set to `t - 1` and must be greater than 0. However, since `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, this detail does not affect the output.
- The variable `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the `print` statement.
- The string `s` is defined as 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. Again, the exact value of `s` is not necessary to determine the output.
- The length of `s` is specified to be less than 200 or exactly 200, but this information is also not required to determine the output.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output is **NO**.
