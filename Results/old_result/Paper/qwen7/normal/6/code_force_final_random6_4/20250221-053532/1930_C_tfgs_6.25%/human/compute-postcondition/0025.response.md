Output State: **`adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - cnt` and must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains `[a[i - 1] - j - 1]` and also includes `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. The values of `adv` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `ans` now includes its original element plus the newly appended value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
