Output State: **`count` is 2, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map` is {'`num % x`': 2}, `mod_y_map` is {'`num % y`': 1}, `results` is [0], `mod_y_key` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code updates the `mod_x_map` dictionary by incrementing the count of the key `mod_x_key` (which is `num % x`). Initially, `mod_x_map` had the key-value pair {'`num % x`': 1}. After executing the line `mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`, the value associated with the key `mod_x_key` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
