Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `t` is 1 (not directly involved in the loop)
   - `i` is 3 (this will be incremented in the loop)
   - `N` must be greater than 2 (this is the upper limit for the loop)
   - `tc` is `N` - 1 (not directly involved in the loop)
   - `a` is a list of integers (not directly involved in the loop)
   - `cnt[a[2]]` is 1 (not directly involved in the loop)

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. For the next iteration, `i` will be 4.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < N`. Since `i` is currently 3 and `N` must be greater than 2, for the loop to continue, `N` must still be greater than 3.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `N`.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 4, `N` must be greater than 3, `tc` is `N` - 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt[a[2]]` is 1**
