Output State: **`d` is `n - 2`, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, `path` now includes the value of `v` appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes us to exit the current loop or conditional block. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
