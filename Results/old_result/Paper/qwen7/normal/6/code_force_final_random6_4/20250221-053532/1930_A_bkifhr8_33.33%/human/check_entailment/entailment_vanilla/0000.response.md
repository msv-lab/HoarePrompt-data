Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes a variable `ans` to store the score for each test case.
   - It splits the input string `l` into a list of integers `lst`.
   - The program enters a loop where it repeatedly takes the minimum of the first two elements in `lst`, adds it to `ans`, and removes those two elements from `lst`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2:` checks if there are at least two elements left in `lst`. If not, it breaks out of the loop.
   - This logic seems flawed because it doesn't handle the case where there are more than two elements correctly.

4. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the scores for each test case.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Loop Logic:**
   - The loop should continue until there are fewer than two elements left in `lst`, not just when `len(lst)` is not equal to 2.
   - The current logic will prematurely terminate the loop if there are more than two elements but less than the required pairs.

2. **Removing Elements:**
   - The removal of elements `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` is incorrect. It should remove the first two elements, not indexed by `0 * 2` and `1 * 2`.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the list has an odd number of elements, which should not occur since the problem guarantees `2n` elements.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = 0
        while len(lst) > 1:
            ans += min(lst[0], lst[1])
            del lst[0]
            del lst[0]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

### Conclusion

The original program has logical errors in handling the loop and element removal. The corrected program ensures that the loop continues until there are fewer than two elements left and removes the first two elements correctly.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
