Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `neg` is the total count of '-' characters in the string `s`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string `s` (since it increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches the length of `s`). The variable `neg` will hold the total count of '-' characters encountered in the string `s` during the loop's execution. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
