Based on the initial state described, the loop will execute `n` times, printing "1" followed by the current value of `i` for each iteration. After all iterations, `t` remains 1000, `i` is `1004 + n`, and `n` is the original input integer.

However, the `print(' ')` statement simply prints a single space character. There is no direct reference to the values of `t`, `i`, or `n` in this specific print statement.

Output: ** **
