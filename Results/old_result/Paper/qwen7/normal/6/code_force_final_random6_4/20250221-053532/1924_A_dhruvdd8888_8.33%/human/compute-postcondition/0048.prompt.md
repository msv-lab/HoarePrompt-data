Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is the last character of the string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing all characters `i` from `s` that are in `us` and for which `len(win) == k` at some point during the loop, `win` is an empty set, and `ps` is the count of times `ans` was appended with a character, indicating how many times `win` reached size `k` during the loop, and `ps` is less than `n`
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet. If `i` is a character in the alphabet and `i` is not in the set `win`, no change is made to `us`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, and if `i` is not in `win`, then `i` is added to `win`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the (k-1)-th character in the alphabet, and `win` contains all elements from the previous `us` plus the newly added `i`, if `i` is not in `win`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
