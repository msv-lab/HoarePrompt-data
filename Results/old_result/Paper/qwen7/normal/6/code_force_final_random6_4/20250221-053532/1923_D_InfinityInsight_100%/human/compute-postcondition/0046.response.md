Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `inx` is less than 0, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables from the initial state without any modifications.
