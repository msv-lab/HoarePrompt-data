Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which in this case means they are not defined yet. The only variable that has been updated is `n`, which now holds the integer value input by the user.
