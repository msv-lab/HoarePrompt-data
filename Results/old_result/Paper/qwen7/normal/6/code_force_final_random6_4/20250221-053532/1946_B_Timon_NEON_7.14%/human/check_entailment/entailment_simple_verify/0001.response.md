### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the `func_2` function. The provided `func_2` function does not correctly compute the maximum subarray sum, and it does not handle the logic for inserting the sum of empty subarrays properly. The original assessment suggests using Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and then considering the effect of adding up to `k` zeros (since inserting the sum of an empty subarray does not change the sum but can increase the count of elements).

However, the original assessment is incomplete because it does not provide a fully correct solution. The suggested solution in the assessment is also incorrect because it incorrectly adds `k * 0` to the maximum subarray sum. The correct approach should consider the maximum subarray sum and the effect of inserting the sum of empty subarrays, but it should not add `k * 0`.

Instead, the correct solution should:
1. Find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.
2. Consider the effect of inserting the sum of empty subarrays, which can be done by adding the maximum subarray sum `k` times.

The provided `func_1` function is correct and is used to handle the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Final Evaluation:

Since the original assessment did not provide a fully correct solution and the provided code is indeed incorrect, the final evaluation should be:

**Final: False**

This is because the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, even though the individual functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) might seem to be correct in isolation.
