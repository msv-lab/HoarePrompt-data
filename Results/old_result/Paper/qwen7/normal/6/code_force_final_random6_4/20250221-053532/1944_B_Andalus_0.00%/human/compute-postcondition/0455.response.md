Output State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is `sz` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Given the initial postcondition that `sz` is `sz` + 1, this means `sz` has been incremented by 1. The condition to break out of the loop or if statement (`sz >= k`) is not evaluated here, so the only change is in the value of `sz`. The precondition that `sng` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
