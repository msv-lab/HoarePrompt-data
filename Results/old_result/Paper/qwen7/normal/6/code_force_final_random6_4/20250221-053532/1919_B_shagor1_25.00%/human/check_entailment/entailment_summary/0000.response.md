Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The program calculates the penalty based on the count of '-' characters in the string, but this does not align with the actual penalty calculation described in the problem statement. The penalty is based on splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray, which is not addressed in the current implementation.

2. **No Splitting Logic**: The program does not include any logic to split the array `a` into subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` and calculate the penalties for these subarrays. Instead, it simply outputs a value based on the count of '-' characters.

3. **Output Mismatch**: For the given examples, the program's output does not match the expected results. For instance, in the third example, the input string is `--+++++++-`, which should be split into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])` to achieve the minimum penalty of 0. However, the program incorrectly outputs 0 for this case as well, which is not always optimal.

Given these points, the program is not implementing the correct logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
