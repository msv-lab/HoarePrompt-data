Postcondition: `ans` is either 2, 1, or 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is either 8 or 10, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 and ending at index 10 and is equal to `a[7:10]`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 3 (or 2 or 1) and `i` is 10. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2 (or 1 or 0) and `i` is 8.
