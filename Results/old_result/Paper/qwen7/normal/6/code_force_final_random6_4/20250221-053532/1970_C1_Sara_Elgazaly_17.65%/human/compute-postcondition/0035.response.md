Postcondition: `s` is True, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` remains unchanged, `x` is now equal to `y`, and `lst[y]` is not empty. If `lst[y]` is not empty, `x` is set to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
