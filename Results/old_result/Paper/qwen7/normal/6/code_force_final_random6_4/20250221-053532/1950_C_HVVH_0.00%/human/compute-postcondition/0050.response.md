Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` and `m` are updated to integers from the input. If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is set to 'PM', `h` is adjusted to `h - 12`, and `m` remains unchanged. If `h` is 12 or less, `day` is set to 'AM', and `h` and `m` remain as updated from the input.
