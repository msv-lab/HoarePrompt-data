Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans_f` contains the final value of `ans`, which is the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from the list `lst`.
   - `lst` must contain at least two elements.
   - The loop will continue to execute until `lst` has less than two elements or the loop completes its full iteration based on the value of `n`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `lst` must have at least two elements.
   - Since the loop will run for `t` iterations, if `t` is greater than 1, the loop will execute again.

4. **Determining the New State:**
   - If `t` is greater than 1, the loop will execute again. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `lst` must still have at least two elements.

5. **Final State:**
   - `ans_f` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are specified.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `lst` must still have at least two elements.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans_f` contains the final value of `ans`, `i` is 1 more than its current value, `lst` must contain at least two elements.**
