Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 2`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `n` and `1`, `t` is decreased by `1`, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `1`, and `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`; `cnt` is increased by 1.**

The code increments the variable `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `cnt` being increased by 1 while keeping all other variables as they were initially.
