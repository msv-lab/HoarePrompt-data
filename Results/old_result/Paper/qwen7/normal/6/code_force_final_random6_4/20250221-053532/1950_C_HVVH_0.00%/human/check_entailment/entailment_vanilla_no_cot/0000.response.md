Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for converting 24-hour time to 12-hour time. Specifically, the logic for determining whether it's AM or PM is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. When `h` is 0, it should be converted to 12 and marked as 'AM', but the current code incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' without checking if `h` was originally 0.
2. For `h` greater than 12, the current code correctly subtracts 12 to convert to the 12-hour format and sets `day` to 'PM'. However, it incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' when `h` is 12, which should remain 'AM'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM' if h != 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

This corrected version ensures that the correct AM/PM designation is applied based on the hour value.
