Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if for each position `i`, the characters in `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that a valid template exists according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- String `a`: `aa`
- String `b`: `bb`
- String `c`: `ab`

According to the problem description, we need to find a template `t` such that both `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not. In this case, a valid template could be `"AA"` or `"BB"`. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return `'NO'` because there is no position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]`.

To correctly solve the problem, the function needs to check if there exists a character in `a` or `b` that matches the corresponding character in `c` and ensure that the other string does not match the same character in the same position. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if (a[i] == c[i] and b[i] != c[i]) or (b[i] == c[i] and a[i] != c[i]):
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

This corrected function ensures that either `a` or `b` matches the template while `c` does not, which aligns with the problem description.
