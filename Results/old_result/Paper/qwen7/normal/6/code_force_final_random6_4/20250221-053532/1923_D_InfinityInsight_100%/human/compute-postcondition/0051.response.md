Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated such that `ans[2]` is 1, `inx` is less than or equal to 0, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `ans[i] = 1` updates the list `ans` at index `i` to be `1`. Given that `i` is `2`, `ans[2]` is now `1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
