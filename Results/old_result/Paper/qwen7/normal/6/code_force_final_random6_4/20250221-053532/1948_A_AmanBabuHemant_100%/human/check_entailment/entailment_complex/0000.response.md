Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the required number of special characters.
3. It checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it correctly prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters with the given construction method.
4. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating 'AAB' `(n // 2)` times. This ensures that every 'B' in the string will be a special character since it has exactly one neighbor that is different ('A').
5. It then checks if the constructed string `s` is within the length limit (less than 200). If so, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
6. The logic handles all constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
