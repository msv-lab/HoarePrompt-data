Output State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `int(info[1]) + 1`, `x` is `(int(info[0]) - int(info[1]) * (int(info[1]) - 1)) // (int(info[1]) - 1)`, `suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus 1, and the current value of `a - i * (i - 1)` is divisible by `i ** 2` and `i * (i - 1)` is also divisible by `i ** 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
