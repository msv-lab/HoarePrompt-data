Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `nums`; `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`; each element in `nums` except possibly the last one is 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `nums` because the loop runs for each index from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`. During each iteration, `ls` accumulates the value of the current element in `nums`. As a result, by the end of the loop, `ls` will be the sum of all elements in `nums`. Each element in `nums` is decremented by `ls` until it becomes 0 (except for the last element if the total sum is not zero).
