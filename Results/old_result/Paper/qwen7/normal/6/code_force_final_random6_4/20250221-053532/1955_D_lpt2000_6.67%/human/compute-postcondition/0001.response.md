State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head: The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable and `nabors` as the range parameter.
2. Determine the conditions for the loop to execute: The loop will execute if `nabors` is a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ `nabors` ≤ 10^4).
3. Adjust the state accordingly: Since the loop depends on `nabors`, we need to ensure that `nabors` meets the required condition for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `nabors` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.
