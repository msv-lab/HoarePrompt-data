Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

    #
    #In more detail, the list `last` remains unchanged as it only records the first occurrences of unique elements and does not get updated inside the loop. The variable `i` will hold the value of the last element in the list `a` after the loop completes. The list `left` will have its last element updated to be the sum of all elements in the list `a`, as each iteration adds the current element `i` to the last element of `left`.

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, with `i` now equal to `n`. The list `a` remains unchanged. The list `ans` is updated such that for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is calculated based on the logic within the loop. Specifically, `ans[i]` is set to `2 - inx` if `inx` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is set to `i + 1 - inx`. The variable `inx` is determined by comparing `inx2` (which is `last[i - 1]`) and `inx` (calculated using `func_1(left, x)`), and `inx` is adjusted to be 0 if it is negative. The list `left` is updated such that its last element is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 1 to n-1) is calculated as follows: if `inx` (determined by the logic inside the loop) is less than or equal to 0, then `ans[i] = 2 - inx`; otherwise, `ans[i] = i + 1 - inx`. The last element of the list `left` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
