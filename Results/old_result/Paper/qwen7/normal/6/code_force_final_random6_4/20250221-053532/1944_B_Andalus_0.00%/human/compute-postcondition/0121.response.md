Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `sz` is 2.
   - `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than `sz`. Since `sz` is 2, `rdb` must have 1 element (because `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, but the specific value of `k` is not provided, so we focus on the length of `rdb`).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.

Given the initial state:
- `sz` is explicitly given as 2.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with 1 element. Let's denote the single element in `rdb` as `elem`.

Since the print statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`, it will print `elem` twice followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem**
