Output State: **`p[i]` is equal to `ind`, `i` is equal to `ind + 6`, and `ind` is equal to `ind + 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `ind` is incremented by 2, so `ind` becomes `ind + 2`. The values of `p[i]` and `i` remain unchanged, with `p[i]` still being equal to `ind` and `i` still being equal to `ind + 4`. Since `n` was initially greater than `ind + 4`, this condition remains true after the increment.
