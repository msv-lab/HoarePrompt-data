Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing the current array segment being processed, and `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit); `new_arr` is an empty list; `xor` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `xor` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, or `new_arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `xor` is set to 0.
