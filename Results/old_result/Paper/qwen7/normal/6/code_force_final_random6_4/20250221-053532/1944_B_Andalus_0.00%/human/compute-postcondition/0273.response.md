Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 2 or 0.
- `sng` is a fully iterated iterable, which means it has been exhausted and no longer contains any elements.
- `elem` is the next element of `rdb`, where `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element.
- The value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
- If `sz >= k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

- Since `sng` is a fully iterated iterable, it has no more elements left.
- `elem` is the next element of `rdb`, and since `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, `elem` must be the first element of `rdb`.

The print statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Since `elem` is the first element of `rdb`, and `rdb` has at least one element, the output will be the first element of `rdb` repeated twice, followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is the first element of `rdb`)
