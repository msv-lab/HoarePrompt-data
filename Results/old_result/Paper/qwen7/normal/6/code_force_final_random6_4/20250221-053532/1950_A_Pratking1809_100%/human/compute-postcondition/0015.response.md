Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `i` is `i + 1`, and `q` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. It does not affect the value of `i` which was already incremented previously, nor does it change the condition for `q`. Therefore, `i` remains `i + 1` and `q` must still be greater than `i + 1`. The initial state of `a`, `b`, and `c` as integers is preserved, but now they hold the values entered by the user.
