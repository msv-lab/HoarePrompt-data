Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and k is now k - 2 * x, `nums` is a deque of n-1 integers (excluding the first and last elements), `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque minus `x`, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque minus `x`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

The value of `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
