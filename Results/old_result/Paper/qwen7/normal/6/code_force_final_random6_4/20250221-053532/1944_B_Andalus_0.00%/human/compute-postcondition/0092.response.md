Postcondition: `sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, `sz` is increased by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Since there is no else part, the sequence `sng` remains unchanged in terms of its elements, but `sz` is incremented by 1 and the loop or if statement is exited if the condition `sz >= k` is met.
