Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. Specifically, the logic for calculating `remaining_cells` and how it affects the total number of screens is flawed. Here's a counterexample to demonstrate this:

Consider the input `(x, y) = (11, 3)`:
- The program calculates `space_x = 11 * 1 = 11` and `space_y = 3 * 4 = 12`.
- It then calculates `screen_require_for_y = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`.
- The remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons are `15 * 2 - 12 = 18`.
- Since `11 > 18`, the program incorrectly calculates `extra_screen = 11 // 15 + 1 = 1`, leading to a total of `2 + 1 = 3` screens, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve more detailed calculations to ensure that the placement of 1x1 and 2x2 icons is optimized across the minimum number of screens. The current implementation does not handle all edge cases correctly.
