Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `v` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the list `v`.
   - The element at index `v[i]` in the list `v` is not equal to `i`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means the loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

3. **Loop Execution**: For each iteration, the value of `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop variable `i` is being incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition `v[i] != i` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **New State**: After the next iteration, the new state should reflect the updated value of `i` and ensure that the condition `v[i] != i` is still satisfied.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `v` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously some value `k`, now `i` is `k + 1`.
- The condition `v[i] != i` must still be true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `v` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `v` such that `i + 1` is within bounds and `v[i + 1]` is not equal to `i + 1`.**
