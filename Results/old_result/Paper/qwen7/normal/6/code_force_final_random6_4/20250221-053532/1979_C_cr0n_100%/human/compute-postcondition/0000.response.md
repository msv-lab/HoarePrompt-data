Output State: **N is an input integer, and vals is a list of N integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `N`. However, since the input value of `N` is not specified in the initial state, we only know that `N` is now an input integer. The list `vals` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
