Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(k)` converts the string `k` into an integer and assigns it to the variable `k`. The values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged.
