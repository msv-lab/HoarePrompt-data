Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, and `ans` remains unchanged if `v[i]` is less than 3; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**

This means that the value of `cnt` is incremented by `v[i]`, and the value of `ans` remains the same unless `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, in which case `ans` is updated according to the given formula.
