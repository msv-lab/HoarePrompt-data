Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be true.
   - The first condition is `l < r`. This means `l` must be less than `r`.
   - The second condition is `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. This means the element at index `l` must be equal to the element at index `l + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `st` is equal to `st + 1`.
   - `l` is equal to `l + 1`.
   - `r` must be greater than `l`.
   - `a[l + 1]` must be equal to `a[l + 2]`.

4. **Adjustments needed**:
   - Since `l` is equal to `l + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `l` must be less than `r` for the loop to execute again.
   - Also, `a[l]` (which is `a[l + 1]`) must be equal to `a[l + 1]` for the second condition to hold.

Given these points, the adjustments needed are:
- Ensure `l < r`.
- Ensure `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

Since `l` is already `l + 1`, we need to ensure that `l` is still less than `r` and that `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:
State: **`st` is equal to `st + 1`, `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` must be greater than `l`, and `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`**.
