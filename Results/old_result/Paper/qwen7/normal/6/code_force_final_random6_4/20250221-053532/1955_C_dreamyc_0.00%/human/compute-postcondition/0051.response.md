Postcondition: `a` and `b` are elements removed from `nums` using `popleft()` and `pop()` respectively, and `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then both `a` and `b` are reduced by `3 * x` and `k` is reduced by `2 * x`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` remains as the minimum of the original `a` and `b`.
