Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1, and `res` is 1 if the first character of `s1` is '1' and the first character of `s2` is '0'. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged, `n` must still be greater than 0, `hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1, and `res` remains unchanged.
