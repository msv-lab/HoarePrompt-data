Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1, 2, or `r - 1` (or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is either 7, 8, or 9 depending on the value of `k` relative to `2 * a[r]`, `k` is reduced by `2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts. If `a[r]` is not zero, the values of `sunks`, `k`, and `a[r]` are updated according to the specified rules. If `a[r]` is zero, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement when `k` reaches zero.
