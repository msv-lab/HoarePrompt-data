Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`. This means the loop continues as long as the second element of the tuple `e` (popped from `min_heap`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `min_heap` has lost one element.
   - `e` is the element popped from `min_heap`.
   - The second element of `e` (let's call it `e[1]`) satisfies the condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

3. **Determine What Needs Adjustment**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must still hold true. Therefore, we need to ensure that the next element popped from `min_heap` also satisfies this condition.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `min_heap` has lost one element, the next element popped from `min_heap` will be the new top element.
   - We need to ensure that the new top element of `min_heap` (let's call it `e_new`) also satisfies the condition `e_new[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

Given these points, the state that needs adjustment is the `min_heap` itself, ensuring that the next element popped from it still satisfies the loop condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`min_heap` must have an element such that the second element of that element is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`**.
