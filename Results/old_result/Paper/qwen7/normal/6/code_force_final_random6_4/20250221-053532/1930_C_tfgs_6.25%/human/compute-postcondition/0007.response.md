Output State: **`i` is 2; `a[2]` is `a[2] + 3`**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 3. Therefore, `a[2]` is updated to its current value plus 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
