Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Calculation**:
   - The program checks if the promotion price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the regular price (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at price `B`. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
     - If `B * 2 >= C`, it means the promotion is beneficial. The program then proceeds to calculate the minimum cost using the promotion.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, the program calculates the total cost as `(A / 2) * C`, which is the cost of buying `A / 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `A` is odd, the program first buys as many pairs as possible (i.e., `X = A // 2` pairs), and then buys the remaining one yogurt at the regular price `B`.
   - The total cost is calculated as `X * C + B`.

### Detailed Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` and `C = 9`, so `B * 2 > C`.
  - Since `A` is even, the total cost is `(2 / 2) * 9 = 9`.
  - Output: `9` (Correct).

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` and `C = 9`, so `B * 2 > C`.
  - Since `A` is odd, the total cost is `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20` (but the expected output is `14`).
  - The program outputs `14` instead of `15 + 5 = 20` because it prints `X` and then `X * C + B` separately, but the logic for odd `A` should directly compute the total cost.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` and `C = 11`, so `B * 2 < C`.
  - Since `A` is odd, the total cost is `(3 // 2) * 11 + 5 = 16 + 5 = 15`.
  - Output: `15` (Correct).

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` and `C = 11`, so `B * 2 < C`.
  - Since `A` is even, the total cost is `(4 / 2) * 11 = 22`.
  - Output: `20` (Incorrect due to the same issue as Test Case 2).

### Conclusion:
The program has an issue with handling the odd number of yogurts correctly. It should directly compute the total cost for odd `A` without printing intermediate values.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + max(B, C - B))
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
