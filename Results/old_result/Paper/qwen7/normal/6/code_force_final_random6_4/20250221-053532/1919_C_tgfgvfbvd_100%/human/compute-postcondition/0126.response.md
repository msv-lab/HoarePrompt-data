Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are swapped, meaning `a` is now equal to the original value of `b` and `b` is now equal to the original value of `a`. `n` remains greater than 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to the original value of `a`, then `a` is updated to the original value of `b`, `b` is updated to the original value of `a`, and `c` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is updated to the original value of `l[x]`, `b` is updated to the original value of `a`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `c` is increased by 1.**
