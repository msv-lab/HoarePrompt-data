Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `1, n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 (since the range is specified as `range(1, n)`).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - `i` should be set to 1 initially.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Consider the other variables**: The other variables (`rgt`, `lst`, `lft`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
