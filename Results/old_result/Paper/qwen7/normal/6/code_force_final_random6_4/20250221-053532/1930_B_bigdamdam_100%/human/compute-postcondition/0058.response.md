Output State: **`ind` is 9, `i` is 8, `p[1]` is 1, `p[3]` is 3, `p[5]` is 5, `p[7]` is 7, `n` is the first integer from the input split into a list.**

Explanation: The code `n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]` takes the input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns the first integer in the list to `n`. Since the initial values of `ind`, `i`, `p[1]`, `p[3]`, `p[5]`, and `p[7]` are unchanged, these values remain the same. The new variable `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
