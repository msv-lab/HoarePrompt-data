Output State: **`n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the input is a valid positive integer within the specified range, the only change is that `n` now holds this integer value. All other variables remain in their initial state, which in this case is not specified, but we know they are unaffected by this operation.
