Output State: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * (`y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`) - `space_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `remaining_cells` is updated to be `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. Since `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is calculated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
