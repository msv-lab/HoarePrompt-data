Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required solution. The key issues are:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in the `func_1` function is incorrect. It uses `l` and `r` incorrectly, leading to an infinite loop or incorrect results. Specifically, `l` and `r` should be initialized to 1 and `n`, respectively, and the loop condition should check `r - l == 1`.

2. **Swapping Elements**: The function does not actually swap elements in the array. Instead, it only prints the indices where swaps might be needed, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as stated.

3. **Output Format**: The function's output format does not match the expected format. It should print the number of operations and the pairs of indices for the swaps, but it only prints "1" or "0" and returns a list with indices.

Given these issues, the program cannot achieve the goal of rearranging the permutation to make `p_l` equal to `x` using at most 2 swaps.

Correctness: **False**
