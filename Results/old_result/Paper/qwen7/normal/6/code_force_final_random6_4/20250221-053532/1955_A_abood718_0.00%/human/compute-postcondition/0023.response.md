Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).
   - `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).
   - `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).
   - The condition `B * 2 < C` or `B * 2 >= C` based on the value of `A` remains unchanged.
   - If `A` is even, `X` is `A // 2`; otherwise, `X` remains undefined.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = int(input()) - 1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - Since `i` is the only variable that changes in the loop head, it needs to be updated.

6. **Other Variables**:
   - `A`, `B`, `C`, `X`, and `t` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

7. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `A`, `B`, `C`, `X`, and `t` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), and the condition `B * 2 < C` or `B * 2 >= C` based on the value of `A` remains unchanged. If `A` is even, `X` is `A // 2`; otherwise, `X` remains undefined.**
