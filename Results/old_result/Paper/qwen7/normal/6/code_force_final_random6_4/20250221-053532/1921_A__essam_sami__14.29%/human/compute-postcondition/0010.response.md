Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `steps` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c` is the first integer entered.
- `d` is the second integer entered.
- `e` is the first integer from the input split.
- `f` is the second integer from the input split.
- `g` is the first integer from the input split.
- `h` is the second integer from the input split.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\), and it is mentioned that the current value of `x` is greater than the value of `n`.

The `print(n)` statement will print the value of `n`, which is the result of the formula \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).

Output: **(a - e)² + (b - f)²**
