Output State: `t` is 0, `g` is the product of all elements in the list `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) when taken pairwise, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the length of the list `l`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `g` will hold the value of the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `l`. The variable `t` remains 0, and `i` will be equal to the length of the list `l`.
