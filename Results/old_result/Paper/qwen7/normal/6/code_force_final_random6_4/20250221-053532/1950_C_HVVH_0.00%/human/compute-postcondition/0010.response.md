Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an input integer greater than 12 minus 12, `m` is an input integer, and `h` is not equal to 0.**

In simpler terms: `h` is decreased by 12, so `h` is now an input integer greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
