Output State: **`cw` is False, `nw` is `cw`, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`**

Explanation: The code `cw = not nw` changes the value of `cw` to the opposite of its current value. Since `nw` is initially equal to `cw`, `nw` remains unchanged. After executing the code, `cw` becomes `False`. The value of `i` is not affected by this code, so it remains `len(nums) - 2`.
