Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` and 0 otherwise, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is `cnt_aa - D`, `C` is now `cnt_bb - D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D.values()`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers input from the user, `nabors` is the number of iterations left to execute, `aa` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `bb` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input split and converted to integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the count of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the count of elements in the list `bb`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `tot` is the sum of the values of `D`, `aa[m:]` must have at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element, and either `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, or `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 while `C[out_aa]` is not increased by 1; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` remains unchanged; `tot` is the sum of the values of `D.values()`, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element, `aa[m:]` must have at least one element, `E[out_aa]` is either decreased by 1 or remains unchanged, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `in_aa` and `out_aa` are updated to the next pair of elements from `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is either unchanged or decreased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D.values()`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
