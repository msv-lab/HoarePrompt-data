Output State: **`i` is 4 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, or `i` is 3 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `i` was 3, it becomes 4; if `i` was 2, it remains 3. The value of `j` and the condition involving `arr` remain unchanged.
