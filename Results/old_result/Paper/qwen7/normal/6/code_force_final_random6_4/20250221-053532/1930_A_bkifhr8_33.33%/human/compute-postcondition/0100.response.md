Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` by the value of that minimum, `lst` is a list with the same conditions as before.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is still `n * 2`, `ans` has been incremented by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and `lst` retains its original list conditions.
