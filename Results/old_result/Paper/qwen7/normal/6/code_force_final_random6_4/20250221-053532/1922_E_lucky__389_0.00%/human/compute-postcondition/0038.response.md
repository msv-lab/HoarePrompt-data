Postcondition: **`i` is 10, `x` is 1022, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10, and `mx` is 10.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `i` is 0, the loop condition is no longer satisfied, and the program breaks out of the loop, leaving `i` at 10, `x` at 1022, `t` within its original range, `subseq_lens` containing the value 10, and `mx` at 10. If `i` is not 0, the loop would continue until the condition is no longer met, but since the else part specifies the final values, we conclude with these values.
