Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`num`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`num2`) and the array elements (`case`).

2. **Array Conversion:**
   - The array elements are split and converted to integers using list comprehension.
   - This part seems correct and necessary.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because no rearrangement is needed.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The program then calculates the beauty of the array by summing up `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from 1 to `num2 - 1`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Sorting and Rearrangement:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum beauty by rearranging the array.
   - Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` are minimized, which maximizes the overall beauty.

2. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - The calculation `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from 1 to `num2 - 1` is correct.
   - This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the highest possible beauty.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the array is already sorted (returns `0`).
   - It also handles cases where the array needs to be rearranged (calculates the beauty correctly).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it in ascending order and then calculating the beauty. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
