Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `N-1`
- `N` is an integer
- `i` remains within the range `[0, N-1]` during the loop execution
- If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is 1
- If `cnt[i]` is not equal to 1, then `t` does not change
- Either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0

The print statement is `print(i)`. Since `i` is explicitly stated to be `N-1`, the value of `i` is known.

Output: **N-1**
