Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while i < len(a) - 2:`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < len(a) - 2`. This means that `i` must be less than the length of the string `a` minus 2.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `a` is a new string input by the user.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is the last possible substring of `a` of length 3, which is either 'map' or 'pie', or does not exist if no such substrings were found throughout the iterations.

4. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, we need to check if `i < len(a) - 2` holds true for the loop to execute at least once.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len(a)` must be greater than 2 (because `i` starts from 0 and needs to be less than `len(a) - 2`).

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)`.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`ans` is 0, `a` is a new string input by the user, `i` is 0, and `len(a)` must be greater than 2**
