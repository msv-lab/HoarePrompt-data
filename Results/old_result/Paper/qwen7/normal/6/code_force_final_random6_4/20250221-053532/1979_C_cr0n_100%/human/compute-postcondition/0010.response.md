Output State: `den` is equal to the result of applying the function `func_1` iteratively `N` times to the initial value `den`, with each application using the next element from the list `vals`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `den` will be the final result of successively applying the function `func_1` to `den` starting with the first element of `vals`, then the second, and so on, until all `N` elements of `vals` have been used.
