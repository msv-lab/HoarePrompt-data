Output State: **`a` is `a - x`, `b` is the last element removed from `nums` using `pop()`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The value of `a` is decreased by `x`, which is the minimum of `a` and `b`. The value of `b` remains unchanged as it was the last element removed from `nums` using `pop()`. The value of `x` also remains unchanged as it is only used in the calculation to update `a`.
