Output State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and `ul` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is `2 * n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. The code sets `l[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Since the initial condition was that if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ul` is incremented by 2, and since `l[a[i] - 1]` is now 0, the value of `ul` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `l[a[i] - 1]` is now 0.
