Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns either 0, the difference between the indices of two consecutive equal elements plus one, or 1. It first checks if any two consecutive elements in the list are equal by comparing elements from both ends of the list towards the center. If no such elements are found, it returns 0. If two consecutive equal elements are found, it returns the distance between them. If no such elements are found after the initial check, it returns 1.**
