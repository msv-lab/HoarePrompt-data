Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`, and the current value of `xor` does not have the `bit`-th bit set to 1**
