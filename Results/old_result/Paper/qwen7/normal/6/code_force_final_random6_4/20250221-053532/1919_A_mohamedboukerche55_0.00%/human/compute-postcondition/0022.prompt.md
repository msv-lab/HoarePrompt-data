You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `a` is the second integer from the last string input by the user, `b` is the second integer from the last string input by the user converted to an integer, `s` is the last string input by the user, `i` is the total number of iterations (k + n), where `n` is the number of iterations minus 2, and `b` is updated to the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: 'bob  '
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: Postcondition: `a` is the second integer from the last string input by the user, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`, `s` is the last string input by the user, `i` is the total number of iterations (k + n), where `n` is the number of iterations minus 2, and the sum `(a + b)` is even if the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is met, otherwise `b` is not updated to the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns either the sum of two non-negative integers a and b (where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9) or an error message if the inputs are out of the specified range.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
