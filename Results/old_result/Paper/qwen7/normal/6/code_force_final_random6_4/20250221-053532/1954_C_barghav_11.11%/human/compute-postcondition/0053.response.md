Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 2.
   - `b` is a list with at least 3 elements.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(b[i], end='')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The variable `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - The list `b` has at least 3 elements, but the specific elements are not provided. Therefore, we know `b` has at least `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]`.

4. **Execution**:
   - The expression `b[i]` will access the element at index 2 of the list `b`.
   - Since `i` is 2, `b[i]` will refer to `b[2]`.

5. **Output**:
   - The value of `b[2]` will be printed without any additional characters due to the `end=''` parameter in the `print` function.

Given this reasoning, the output will be the value of the third element in the list `b`.

Output: **b[2]**
