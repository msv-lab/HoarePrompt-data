Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is updated to the first input integer, `q` is updated to the second input integer, `operations` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers formed by splitting the input string and converting it to integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes `operations` as a list of lists. Each sublist within `operations` is created by taking input from the user, splitting the input string into parts, and converting those parts to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This operation is repeated `n` times, where `n` is the value of the first input integer. The values of `t` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state, but `n` is updated to the first input integer, and `operations` is constructed according to the specified method.
