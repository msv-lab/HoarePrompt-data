Output State: **`ans` is 3 (or 2 or 1), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is 10, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 and ending at index 10 and is equal to `a[7:10]`**.

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 2, it becomes 3; if it was 1, it becomes 2; and if it was 0, it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
