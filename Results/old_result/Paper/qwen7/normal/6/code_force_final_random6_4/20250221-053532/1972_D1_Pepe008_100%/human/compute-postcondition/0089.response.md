Output State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `int(info[1]) + 2`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is `suma + x`**.

Explanation: The variable `suma` is updated by adding the value of `x` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
