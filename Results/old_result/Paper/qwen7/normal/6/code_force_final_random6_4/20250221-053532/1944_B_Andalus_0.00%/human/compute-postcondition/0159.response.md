Output State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code `lft = lst[:n]` creates a new list `lft` that contains the first `n` elements from the list `lst`. The values of `rdb`, `sz`, `n`, `k`, and `lst` remain unchanged from their initial state.
