Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `d` is the second integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the next input split, `f` is the second integer from the next input split, `g` is an integer from the input split, `h` is an integer from the input split.**

The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them, converting each to an integer and assigning them to `g` and `h` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
