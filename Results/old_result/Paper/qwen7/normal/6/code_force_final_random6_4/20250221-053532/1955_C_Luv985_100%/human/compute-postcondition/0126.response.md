Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l+1]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, and `r` is reduced by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. The values of `ans`, `k`, `a[l+1]`, `a[r]`, and the condition for reducing `k` by `mi * 2` if `a[l]` equals 0 remain unchanged from the initial state.
