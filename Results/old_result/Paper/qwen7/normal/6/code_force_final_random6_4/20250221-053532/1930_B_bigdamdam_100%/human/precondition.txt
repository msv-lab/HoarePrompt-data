t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the sum of all n does not exceed 10^5. Each n represents the length of the permutation p, which must consist of distinct integers from 1 to n and satisfy the condition that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.
