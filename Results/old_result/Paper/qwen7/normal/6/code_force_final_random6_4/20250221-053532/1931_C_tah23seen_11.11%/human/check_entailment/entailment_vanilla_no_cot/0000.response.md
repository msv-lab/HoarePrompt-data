Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` is trying to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by finding the first pair of unequal elements from both ends.
   - However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to make all elements equal using at most one operation. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The function would incorrectly suggest changing the entire segment starting from the first element to the last element, which is not the optimal solution.

2. **Operation Cost Calculation**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to make all elements equal, which involves identifying the optimal segment to change and the value to which it should be changed.
   - The current implementation does not handle this correctly. It only checks for the first pair of unequal elements from both ends, which may not yield the minimum cost.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify the distinct values in the array.
- For each distinct value, calculate the cost of making all elements equal to that value.
- Return the minimum cost among these calculations.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    
    # Find all unique values in the array
    unique_values = set(arr)
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    for val in unique_values:
        cost = 0
        start = 0
        for end in range(n):
            if arr[end] != val:
                cost += end - start
                start = end + 1
        cost += n - start
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    print(min_cost)
    t -= 1
```

This code correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by considering each unique value and computing the cost of making all elements equal to that value.
