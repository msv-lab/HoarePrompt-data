Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `ii` must be an integer between 1 and t inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
