Postcondition: `d` is `n-1`, `v` is an element of `remaining_vertices`, and after executing the if-else block, if `v` is found in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, `path` now includes the value of `v` minus one occurrence, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not found in `remaining_vertices`, no changes occur.
