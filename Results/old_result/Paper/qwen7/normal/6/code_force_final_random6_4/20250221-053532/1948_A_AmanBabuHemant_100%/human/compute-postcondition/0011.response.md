Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an even integer.
- The length of `s` is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times and is less than 200.

To determine the value of `s`:
1. `s` is constructed by repeating the string 'AAB' `n // 2` times.
2. Since `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will be a positive integer.
3. The maximum length of `s` is less than 200.

Let's consider the possible values:
- If `n = 2`, then `n // 2 = 1`, so `s = 'AAB'`.
- If `n = 4`, then `n // 2 = 2`, so `s = 'AAB AAB'`.
- If `n = 6`, then `n // 2 = 3`, so `s = 'AAB AAB AAB'`.

We need to find the largest possible value of `n` such that the length of `s` is less than 200. Each repetition of 'AAB' adds 3 characters to the length of `s`. Therefore, the length of `s` when `n = 200` would be `200 // 2 * 3 = 100 * 3 = 300`, which exceeds 200. So, the largest possible value for `n` is 198 (since `198 // 2 = 99` and `99 * 3 = 297` which is still under 200).

Thus, `s` could be 'AAB' repeated up to 99 times, but the exact number of repetitions is not specified beyond it being less than 200/3 â‰ˆ 66.67, so the maximum practical length is 66 repetitions.

Therefore, `s` will be 'AAB' repeated 66 times.

Output: **AAB AAB AAB ... AAB (repeated 66 times)**
