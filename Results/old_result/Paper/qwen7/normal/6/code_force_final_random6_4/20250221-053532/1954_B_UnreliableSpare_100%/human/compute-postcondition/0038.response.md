Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - If `arr[i]` equals `val`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration (assuming it is done inside the loop body), `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but based on the given information, `n` does not change.
   - The conditions for `ans` and `cnt` depend on the comparison `arr[i] == val`, which happens inside the loop. Therefore, these values will be adjusted within the loop body.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1` because it is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
   - `ans` and `cnt` will be adjusted based on the comparison `arr[i] == val` inside the loop, but their exact values cannot be determined without seeing the loop body.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1**
