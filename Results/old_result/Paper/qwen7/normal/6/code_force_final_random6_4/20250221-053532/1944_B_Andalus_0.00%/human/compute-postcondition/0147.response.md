Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved in this loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `sng`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `rdb` must not be empty.
   - `sz` is equal to `k` + 2.
   - `sng` must not be empty.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop is based on iterating over `sng`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute again is `sng`.
   - `elem` will take on the next value from `sng` in each iteration, but its current value does not need to be explicitly stated since it changes with each iteration.
   - The conditions involving `rdb` and `sz` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no such modification is mentioned, they stay the same.
   - The fact that the most internal loop or if statement was broken out of remains unchanged as well.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one element (since the loop continues as long as `sng` is not empty).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `rdb` must not be empty, `sz` is equal to `k` + 2, `sng` must not be empty, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
