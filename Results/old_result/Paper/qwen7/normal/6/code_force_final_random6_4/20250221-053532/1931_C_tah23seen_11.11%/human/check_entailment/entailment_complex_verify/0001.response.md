### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires making all elements of an array equal using at most one operation where we can set a subarray to a single value \( x \). The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray.
   - The goal is to minimize the cost to make all elements equal.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(arr)` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1(arr)` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

3. **Analyzing `func_1(arr)`**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array respectively.
   - It checks if the elements at `i` and `j` are the same. If they are, it moves both pointers inward.
   - If the elements at `i` and `j` are different, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the pointers cross each other (`i > j`), it means all elements are already the same, so it returns 0.
   - If the elements at `i` and `i+1` are the same, it moves the pointer `i` inward.
   - Finally, it returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j`.

4. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The function `func_1(arr)` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal.
   - It only checks for adjacent elements being the same and does not consider the possibility of setting a subarray to a specific value \( x \) to minimize the cost.
   - The logic inside the function does not handle the scenario where the array needs to be divided into multiple segments to make all elements equal.
   - The function does not account for the optimal way to use the operation to make all elements equal.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest segment of the array that can be made equal with a single operation.
   - We should iterate through the array and keep track of the longest segment where the elements are the same.
   - The cost would be the length of this segment minus one (since the operation sets the entire segment to a single value).

6. **Reviewing the Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code provides a detailed breakdown of the states and logic within the function.
   - However, the logic still does not correctly handle the problem as described. The function does not properly identify the longest segment of equal elements.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to account for the optimal way to use the operation to make all elements equal.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the longest segment of equal elements and thus cannot compute the minimum cost to make all elements equal.
