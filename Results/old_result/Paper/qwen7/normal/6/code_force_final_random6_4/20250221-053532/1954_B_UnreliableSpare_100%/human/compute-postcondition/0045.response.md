Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `flag` remains False, `val` is the initial value of `arr[0]`, and `cnt` is 0.**

This means that the value of `ans` is now the smaller of its original value and the current value of `cnt`. All other variables (`flag`, `val`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
