Output State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` anymore, `d` is -1, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, `n` is still greater than 0, and `path` now includes the value of `u` twice.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a block of code. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables `remaining_vertices`, `d`, `v`, `u`, `n`, or `path`. The only change is that the loop or block of code is exited. The value of `v` remains the same as the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, and `u` also remains the same as the value returned by `func_1(-1)`. The `path` now includes the value of `u` twice, and `n` is still greater than 0. The `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` anymore, and `d` is -1.
