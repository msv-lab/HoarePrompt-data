Output State: `l` is increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-1`, `r` remains unchanged, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-1`.

To explain this in simpler terms: The loop continues as long as there are still consecutive identical elements in the list starting from index `l`. Each time the loop runs, it increments `l` and `st` by 1, effectively skipping over these consecutive elements. The loop stops when `l` reaches a point where the elements are no longer identical or when `l` is no longer less than `r`. Therefore, `st` will be the count of all consecutive identical elements from the start of the list up to but not including `r`, and `l` will be the position right after the last set of consecutive identical elements.
