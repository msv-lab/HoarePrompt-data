You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `k` retains its final value as determined by the loop's conditions, `x` also retains its final value as determined by the loop's conditions, and `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `i` is set to `x + 1` because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`, making `i` equal to `x` after all iterations. The variable `s` is updated through the loop to include the sum of `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`. Given the operations `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` starting from `s = 1`, `s` will be the sum of 1 plus the result of adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration, which ultimately results in `s` being `x + 1`.
    #
    #To summarize, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:
    #- `k`: The integer value entered by the user.
    #- `x`: The integer value entered by the user.
    #- `a`: The integer value entered by the user, unchanged.
    #- `i`: Equal to `x`.
    #- `s`: The sum of 1 plus the result of adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`, resulting in `s = x + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` with specific constraints and returns different values based on the conditions provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
