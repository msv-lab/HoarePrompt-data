Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should start at 1.
   - The value of `n` must be at least 2 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`, `n` must be greater than 1).

3. **Check the current state of the objects**:
   - `left` is a list containing [0].
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the sizes of the slimes.
   - `last` is a list containing [-1].
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being 1, we need to ensure that `i` is 1.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
