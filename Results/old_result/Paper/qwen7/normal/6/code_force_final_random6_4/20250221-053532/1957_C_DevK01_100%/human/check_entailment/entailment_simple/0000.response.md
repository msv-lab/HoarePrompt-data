### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the number of possible final configurations of an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where you and the computer place rooks alternately without attacking each other.
   - The provided code correctly handles the reduction in the number of available positions after each move due to the rooks placed.
   - The function `func_1` computes the number of ways to place rooks on an \(n \times n\) board after accounting for the initial \(k\) moves.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case, reducing the effective size of the board (`n`) by 2 for each move where the coordinates are different and by 1 for each move where the coordinates are the same.
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations for an \(n \times n\) board, starting from smaller boards and building up to the full size.
   - The recurrence relation used in `func_1` is correct for calculating the number of configurations:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (7 + 10^9)
     \]
     This relation correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size \(i \times i\) after accounting for the initial moves.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where \(r_i = c_i\) correctly by reducing the board size by 1 instead of 2.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
