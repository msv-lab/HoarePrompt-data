Output State: **Postcondition: `ans` contains all elements it was initialized with, `temp` includes all unique `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`, and `c` is either '1' or '?' for all iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will contain every element it started with (assuming no elements were removed or added during the loop). The set `temp` will include every possible combination of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`, where `q` is processed in each iteration. Additionally, the condition for adding elements to `temp` (i.e., when `c` is '1' or '?') remains the same for all iterations.
