Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` is reduced by \(2 \times x\), `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements, `a` is the first element that was popped from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is the last element that was popped from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is decreased by the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= 2 * x` subtracts \(2 \times x\) from `k`. Here, `x` is defined as the minimum of `a` and `b`. The values of `ans`, `t`, `n`, `nums`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
