Postcondition: `i` is 0, `c` is the previous value of `c` + 1, and `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1]`. This is because if `c == n - 1` is true, `i` remains 0, `c` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to include `k0 - 1`. If `c == n - 1` is false, `i`, `c`, and `ans` retain their original values as specified in the precondition.
