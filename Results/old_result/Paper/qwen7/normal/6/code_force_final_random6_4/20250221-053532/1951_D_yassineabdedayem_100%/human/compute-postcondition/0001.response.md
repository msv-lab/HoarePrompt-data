Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t` (which is used as the range parameter).

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an input integer and the range is from 1 to 1000, we need to ensure that `t` is within this valid range.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `t` is a valid input integer within the specified range (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000) for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is within the valid range.

**State:**
**`t` is an input integer that must be within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000**
