Output State: **`j` is 2, `adv` must be at least 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - 3`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends a new element to the list `ans`. Given that `j` was initially 1, the expression `a[i - 1] - j - 1` simplifies to `a[i - 1] - 2`, which is already stored in `ans`. After executing the code, `j` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The list `ans` now contains the value `a[i - 1] - 3` because `j` is now 2.
