Output State: **`ind` is 3, `i` is 3, `p[1]` is 1, `p[3]` is 3**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` (which is 3) to the index `i` in the list `p`. Since `i` is 3, `p[3]` is updated to 3. The values of `ind`, `i`, and `p[1]` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
