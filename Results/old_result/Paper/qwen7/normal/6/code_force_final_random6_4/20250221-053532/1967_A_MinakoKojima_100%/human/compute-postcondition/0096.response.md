Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Initial state of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `3`.

4. **Determine the required value of `n`**: For the loop to execute, `i` must satisfy the condition `i < n`. Given that `i` starts at `3`, `n` must be greater than `3` for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `i` starts at `3` and `n` is greater than `3` for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
