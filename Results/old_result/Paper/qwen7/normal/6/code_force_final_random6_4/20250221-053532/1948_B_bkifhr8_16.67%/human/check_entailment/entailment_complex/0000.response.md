Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The key issue lies in how the operations are performed and the handling of the conditions. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The program attempts to split elements greater than 10 and insert the digits back into the list. However, it does so in a way that doesn't guarantee the array will eventually become sorted. The logic inside the loop only checks if the previous element is greater than the current one and splits the element if true. This approach does not ensure that the array will be sorted after all possible operations.

2. **Lack of Iterative Operations**: The program performs the splitting operation once per element and then checks if the array is sorted. If not, it prints 'No'. However, the problem allows for multiple operations, and the current implementation does not account for the possibility of performing these operations iteratively until the array is sorted or determined to be unsortable.

3. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` simply checks if the list is sorted, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition. It does not help in determining if the operations can make the list sorted.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
