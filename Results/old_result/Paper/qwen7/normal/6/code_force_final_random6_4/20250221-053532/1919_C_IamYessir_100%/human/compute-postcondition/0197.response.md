Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, and `x` is the last element of list `a`; `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of list `a` to variable `y`. Since `a` has at least one element and `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is set to `x`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
