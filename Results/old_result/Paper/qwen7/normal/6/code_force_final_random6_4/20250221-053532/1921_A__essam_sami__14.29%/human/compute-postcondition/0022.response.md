Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `steps` is 1 (though `steps` is not used in the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are input integers (their values are unknown but they are used in the calculation of `n`).
- `c` and `d` are the first and second integers from the input split (their values are known and will be used in the calculation of `x`).
- `e` and `f` are the first and second integers from the next input split (their values are known and will be used in the calculation of `n`).
- `g` and `h` are integers from the input split (their values are known and will be used in the calculation of `x`).

The variable `x` is calculated as \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\). Since `c`, `d`, `g`, and `h` are explicitly defined as integers from the input split, their values are known and will be used in this calculation.

The print statement will output the value of `x`.

Output: **(c - g)² + (d - h)²**
