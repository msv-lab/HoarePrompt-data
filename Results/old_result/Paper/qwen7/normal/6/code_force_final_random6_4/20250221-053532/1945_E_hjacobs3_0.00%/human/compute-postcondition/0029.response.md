Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation of length `n` and an integer `find` such that `1 ≤ find ≤ n`. It performs a binary search to find the index of `find` in `array`. If `find` is not found, it prints "1" and returns a list containing "1" and the index where `find` should be inserted to maintain the permutation order. If `find` is found, it prints "0" and returns a list containing "1" and the index of `find` in the array, both incremented by 1. The original `array` remains unchanged, and the final values of `l` and `r` are 0 and -1, respectively.**
