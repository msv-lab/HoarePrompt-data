Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Let's break down why it is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using a loop from `1` to `b`. However, the logic inside this loop is flawed.
   - Specifically, the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent checks do not accurately determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Misunderstanding the Condition:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This means that for each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(\frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) is an integer.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle this condition.

3. **Improper Handling of GCD:**
   - The program does not compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) within the loop, which is necessary to correctly determine the validity of each pair.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Compute the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) for each pair.
- Check if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Count the number of valid pairs accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected program iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the given condition correctly.
