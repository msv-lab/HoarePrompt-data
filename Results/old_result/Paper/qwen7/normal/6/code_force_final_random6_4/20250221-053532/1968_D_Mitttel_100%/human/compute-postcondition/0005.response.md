Output State: **`mx` is 0, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `s` is a list of integers representing the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`, `cur` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `vis` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `1` at index `s[0]` and all other elements are `0`.**

Explanation: The code `vis[s] = 1` sets the value of `vis` at the index specified by the first element of the list `s` to `1`. All other elements of `vis` remain `0`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
