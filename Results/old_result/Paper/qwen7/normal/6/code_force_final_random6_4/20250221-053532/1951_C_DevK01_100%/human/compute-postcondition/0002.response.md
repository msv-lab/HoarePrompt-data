Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `L`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.
