Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `r` with `n` zeros. The length of `r` is determined by the value of `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
