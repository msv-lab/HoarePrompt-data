Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is increased by `dif` if `i` is 3, `k` is 0 if `i` is 2, `res` is decreased by 3 if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 2 and then increased by `k % (i + 1)` if `i` is 3, `k` is now 0, and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. We break out of the loop or if statement we were inside.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement we were inside. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
