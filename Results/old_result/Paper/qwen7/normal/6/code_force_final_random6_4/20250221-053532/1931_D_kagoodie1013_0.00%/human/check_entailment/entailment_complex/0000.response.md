Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and organizes it into a list of test cases, where each test case includes the size of the array (`n`), the integers `x` and `y`, and the array itself.
2. The `func_1` function iterates through each test case, calculating the number of beautiful pairs using the conditions specified in the problem statement.
3. For each element in the array, the function computes the modulus with respect to `x` and `y`, and uses these values to find pairs that satisfy the conditions.
4. The function correctly updates the counts using the modulus maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`), ensuring that the counts reflect the number of pairs meeting the criteria.
5. The function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case, which is consistent with the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
