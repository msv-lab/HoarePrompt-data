The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\). It calculates an initial value for \(t\) as \(b \times 2\), then modifies \(t\) based on certain conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\). Specifically, it checks if \(t\) is divisible by 5; if not, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 5. It then adjusts \(t\) further based on the difference between \(a\) and a calculated value \(t1\). If \(t1\) is less than \(a\), \(t\) is increased by the appropriate amount to make up for the shortfall, again rounding up to the nearest multiple of 15 if necessary. Finally, it prints the resulting value of \(t\) for each test case.
