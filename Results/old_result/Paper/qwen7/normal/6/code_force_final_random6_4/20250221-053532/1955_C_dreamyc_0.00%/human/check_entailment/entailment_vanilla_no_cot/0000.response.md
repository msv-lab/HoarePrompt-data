Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the `func_1` function when handling the remaining attacks after the main loop. Specifically, the logic for handling the last remaining ship is flawed. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues and the correct approach:

1. **Handling Remaining Attacks**: After the main loop, there might be remaining attacks (`k`) and only one ship left. The current implementation checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the remaining ship's durability but does not correctly account for the remaining attacks.

2. **Correct Approach**: Instead of checking just if `k` is greater than or equal to the remaining ship's durability, we should check if `k` is greater than or equal to the remaining durability of the last ship and then decrement `k` accordingly. This ensures that we correctly account for all remaining attacks.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        (a, b) = (nums.popleft(), nums.pop())
        x = min(a, b)
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
    # Handle the last remaining ship
    if k and len(nums) == 1:
        if k >= nums[0]:
            ans += 1
            k -= nums[0]
    return ans
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly count the number of ships sunk by the Kraken.
