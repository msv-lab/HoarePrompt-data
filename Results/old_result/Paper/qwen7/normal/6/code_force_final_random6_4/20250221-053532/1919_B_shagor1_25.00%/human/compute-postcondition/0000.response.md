Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length n.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the string `s` is still defined but not modified. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `s`, while updating `n` to the integer input value.
