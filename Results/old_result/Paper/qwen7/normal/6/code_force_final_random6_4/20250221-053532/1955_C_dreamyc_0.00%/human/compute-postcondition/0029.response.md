To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero (`k > 0`) and the length of the deque `nums` is at least 2 (`len(nums) >= 2`).

2. **Current State**:
   - `ans` is either 0 or 1.
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
   - `nums` is a deque of \(n-1\) integers (excluding the first and last elements).

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `k > 0` and `len(nums) >= 2` must be true.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `t`, `n`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head conditions, they do not need to be adjusted.
   - We need to ensure that `k` remains non-zero and `len(nums)` remains at least 2.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `k` must remain non-zero, and `len(nums)` must remain at least 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be non-zero.
- `len(nums)` must be at least 2.

### Final Answer:
State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, and `len(nums)` must be at least 2.**
