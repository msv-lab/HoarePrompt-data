Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 4.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string (though the input string is not provided, this does not affect the output of the `print(*ans)` statement).
- `n` is 4.
- `k` is 1.
- `k0` is equal to 4.
- `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4].
- `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16].
- `c` is 5.

The `print(*ans)` statement will unpack the list `ans` and print its elements separated by spaces. Since `ans` is explicitly given as [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], the output will be:

Output: **4 1 0 2 0 8 0 16**
