Output State: `index` is `18 + 3 * n + 8 + 2 * n`, `PB` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times, `PS` is now `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - 3 * n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - 3 * n` to `index - 3 * n + 3 * n` into integers.

This output state describes the final condition of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The `index` variable will be at the position `18 + 3 * n + 8 + 2 * n` because it increments by 4 each iteration and by `2 * n` in total over 3 iterations. The `results` list will contain the return value of `func_1` three times since the loop appends the same result to the list in each iteration. The `PB`, `k`, `n`, `t`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` variables will reflect their values after the last iteration of the loop.
