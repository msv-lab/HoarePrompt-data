Postcondition: **`segments_variants` must include at least one element (the new variant), `segment` is the new variant, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found so far, `max_sum` remains -1, `total_max_segment` is set to `[-1]`. The first element of `total_max_segment` is less than the first element of `segment`**.
