Output State: **`vis[s]` is 0, `k` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
