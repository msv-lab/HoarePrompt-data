Postcondition: `k` must be greater than 0; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `ans` is increased by 1 if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` in both cases; `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each reduced by `mi` if `a[r]` does not equal 0 after the reduction; `l` is increased by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1 if `a[r]` equals 0 after the reduction.
