Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `suma` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to store the count of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of `i`**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `b` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)
     \]
   - If `x` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - It then checks if both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0` hold true. If they do, it adds 1 to `suma`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all values of `i`, it prints `suma - 2`.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Formula Analysis
The formula used in the program:
\[
x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)
\]
This formula seems to be an attempt to calculate the number of valid `a` values for a fixed `b` and `i`. However, this formula does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Condition Check
The condition check:
\[
(a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0 \quad \text{and} \quad i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0
\]
These conditions are not relevant to the problem. They do not help in determining whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Final Adjustment
The final adjustment `suma - 2` is unnecessary and incorrect. It should not be subtracted unless there is a specific reason related to the problem constraints, which is not evident here.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
