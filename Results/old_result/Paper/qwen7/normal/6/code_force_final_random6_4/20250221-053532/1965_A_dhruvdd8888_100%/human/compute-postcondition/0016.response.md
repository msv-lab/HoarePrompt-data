Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `nums`; `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list; each element in `nums` has been reduced by its corresponding cumulative `ls` value starting from the first iteration; `nw` is set to True.**

Explanation: The code `nw = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `nw`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `ls`, or the elements in the `nums` list. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with the addition that `nw` is now set to `True`.
