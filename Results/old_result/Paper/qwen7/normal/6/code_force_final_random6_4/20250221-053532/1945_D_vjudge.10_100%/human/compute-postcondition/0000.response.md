Output State: **`pergunta` is a string, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, the lengths of `a` and `b` are both equal to `n`, and `x` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `x`. Since no other variables are affected, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
