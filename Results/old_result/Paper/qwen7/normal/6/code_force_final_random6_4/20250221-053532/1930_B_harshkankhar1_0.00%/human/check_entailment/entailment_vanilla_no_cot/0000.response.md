Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The function `func_1()` generates a permutation by reversing every other element starting from the first element, which does not guarantee that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) will satisfy the condition where \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\). 

For example, consider \(n = 4\):
- The generated permutation would be \([4, 3, 2, 1]\).
- Here, \(p_1 = 4\) divides \(p_3 = 2\) and \(p_2 = 3\) divides \(p_4 = 1\), which violates the condition.

A correct solution should ensure that no such pairs \((i, j)\) exist. One possible correct approach could involve generating a permutation where elements are alternately chosen from the highest and lowest remaining values, ensuring that no division relationship exists between consecutive elements or their immediate successors.
