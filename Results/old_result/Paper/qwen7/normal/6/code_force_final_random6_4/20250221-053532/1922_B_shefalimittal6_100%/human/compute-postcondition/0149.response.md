Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `idx - 1`, `cnt` is `v[0] + v[2]`, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` where `i` is 3. Since `i` is 3, `v[i]` is `v[3]`. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and `cnt`) retain their initial values from the initial state.
