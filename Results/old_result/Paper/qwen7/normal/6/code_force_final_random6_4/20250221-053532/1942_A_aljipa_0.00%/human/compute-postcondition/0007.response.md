Output State: **`res` is `[1] * n` if `k` equals `n`, otherwise `res` is `range(n)` if `k` equals `1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^3 - 1\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` based on the conditions involving `k` and `n`. If `k` equals `n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones. If `k` equals `1`, `res` becomes the range from `0` to `n-1`. Otherwise, `res` is set to `[-1]`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided.
