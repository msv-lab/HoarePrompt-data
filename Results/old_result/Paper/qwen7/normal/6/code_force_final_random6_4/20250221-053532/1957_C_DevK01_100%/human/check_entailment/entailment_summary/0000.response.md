Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where each move is mirrored by the opponent. The key is to correctly reduce the size of the board after each move and then compute the number of configurations using the provided function.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes a list `dp` with the first two elements as 1 and 3.
   - For each integer `i` from 2 to `n`, it updates `dp` using the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)`.
   - This formula seems to be derived from combinatorial mathematics, specifically related to counting non-attacking rook placements.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\).
   - It then iterates through the \(k\) moves, reducing the effective size of the board (`n`) by 2 if the move is not a diagonal (i.e., `a != b`) and by 1 if it is a diagonal.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(n)` to get the number of configurations and prints the result.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in the main program correctly reduces the board size based on the moves.
   - The function `func_1` appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem's requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and the function implementation seem to align with the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
