Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with the condition that consecutive elements in the list are equal until the end of the list is reached, `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is 0, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is false, `end` is `n - 1`, and the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `-1**.

Explanation: The code assigns `r - l - 1` to `ans`. Given that `l` is `n - 2` and `r` is 0, `ans` is calculated as `0 - (n - 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `-1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
