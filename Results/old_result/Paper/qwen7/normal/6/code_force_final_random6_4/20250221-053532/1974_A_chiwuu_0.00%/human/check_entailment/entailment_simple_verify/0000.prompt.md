You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

    #State: Output State: The final value of `t` after the loop executes all its iterations is determined by the cumulative effect of the operations performed within each iteration. Specifically, for each iteration, the value of `t` is updated based on the conditions provided. After all iterations, `t` will be the sum of the adjustments made during each iteration, starting from the initial value of `t` (which is `b * 2`), and modified by the logic inside the loop. Each iteration updates `t` based on the inputs `a` and `b` provided by the user, and the final value of `t` will reflect the total accumulated changes across all iterations.
    #
    #The exact final value of `t` cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific values of `a` and `b` for each iteration, but it will be the result of repeatedly applying the logic described in the loop, starting from `t = b * 2` and adjusting `t` based on the conditions given.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Let's consider a specific case to demonstrate this:

- For the input `12 4`, the expected output is `2`. This is because we can place 4 icons of size `2x2` in 1 screen, and the remaining 8 icons of size `1x1` can be placed in another screen. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed.

Let's analyze the program's logic:
1. It calculates `t = b * 2` which represents the total number of `2x2` icons in terms of `1x1` cells.
2. It then checks if `t` is divisible by 5 and adjusts `t` accordingly.
3. It calculates `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` which seems to be an attempt to account for the remaining space after placing `2x2` icons.
4. It then checks if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (number of `1x1` icons) and sets `t` accordingly.
5. Finally, it calculates `t2` and adjusts `t` further.

This logic does not correctly handle the placement of `1x1` icons in the remaining space after placing `2x2` icons. A more accurate approach would involve calculating the number of full `2x2` icons that can fit in each screen and then determining how many additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining `1x1` icons.

For instance, in the case of `12 4`, the program might incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed, leading to an incorrect output.
