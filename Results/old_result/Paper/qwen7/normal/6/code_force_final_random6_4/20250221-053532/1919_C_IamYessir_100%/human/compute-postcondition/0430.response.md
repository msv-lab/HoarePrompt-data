Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index `i` (which is now 1), and `b` has appended `lit[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `b` appends `lit[1]` to itself. Since no other changes are made to the variables, their states remain as described in the initial state except for `i`, which is incremented by 1 due to the nature of list append operations in a loop context, making it 2.
