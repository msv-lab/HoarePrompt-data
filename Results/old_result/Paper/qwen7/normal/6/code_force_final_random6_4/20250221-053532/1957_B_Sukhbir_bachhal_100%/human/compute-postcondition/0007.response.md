Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is `n != 0`.
- The loop head involves the variable `n`, which is described as "right-shifted by 1" at the end of the previous iteration.
- We need to determine the state of `n` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `n` is not zero (`n != 0`).
2. **Current State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `position` is 1.
   - `n` is `n` right-shifted by 1.

3. **Right-Shift Operation**: Right-shifting `n` by 1 means dividing `n` by 2 (integer division). For example, if `n` was 8, after right-shifting by 1, `n` becomes 4.

4. **Determine the Next State of `n`**: For the loop to continue, `n` must not be zero. Therefore, the right-shifted value of `n` must still be non-zero.

5. **Adjusting the State**: Since `n` is right-shifted by 1, the new value of `n` should be non-zero. This means the original value of `n` before the right-shift must have been at least 2 (since 1 right-shifted by 1 results in 0).

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` after the right-shift must be non-zero. Therefore, `n` itself must be at least 2 before the right-shift operation.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `position` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
