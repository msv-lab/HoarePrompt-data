Output State: **`segments_variants` is now ['new_segment', 'i - 1'], `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1, `arr` has at least one element, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0, and the first segment (`max_segment[0]`) is not greater than the first segment of `new_segment (`new_segment[0]`).**

Explanation: The code appends a new segment, which is the concatenation of `new_segment` and `[i - 1]`, to the `segments_variants` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
