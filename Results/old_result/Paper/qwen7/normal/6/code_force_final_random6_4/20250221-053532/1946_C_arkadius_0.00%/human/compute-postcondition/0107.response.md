Output State: **The program returns the tuple (tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size)**

This means the program returns two values:
- `tree.vertices[s].good_components`: This value is the total count of good components from all descendants of vertex `s`, considering the size constraints. It is incremented by 1 if any descendant's `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, or by the `good_components` value of that descendant otherwise.
- `tree.vertices[s].remaining_size`: This value holds the sum of `remaining_size` values of all descendants of vertex `s` that meet the size constraint `x`.
