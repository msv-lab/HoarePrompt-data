Output State: **`t` is 0, `g` is `l[0]`, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Initially, `g` is 1 and `i` is 0, so `g` is updated to `1 * l[0] // gcd(1, l[0])`. Since the gcd of 1 and any number is the number itself, `g` becomes `l[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
