Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` equals 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `max` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `max` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
