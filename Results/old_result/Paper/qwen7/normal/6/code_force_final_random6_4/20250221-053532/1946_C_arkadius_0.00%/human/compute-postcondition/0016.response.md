Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed; and `tree`, an instance of a custom Tree class that represents the tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree. The function returns information based on the operations performed on the tree, specifically related to removing `k` edges.**

This means the function `func_5` takes an integer `n` indicating the number of vertices in a tree, an integer `k` indicating how many edges should be removed from the tree, and a `tree` object which is an instance of a custom Tree class capable of adding edges and rooting the tree. The function then performs the specified edge removals and returns relevant information about the resulting tree structure.
