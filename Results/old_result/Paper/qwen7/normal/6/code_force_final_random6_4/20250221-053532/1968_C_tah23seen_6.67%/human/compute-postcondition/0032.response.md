Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 1
- `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`
- `ans[2]` must be less than or equal to `arr[2]`
- `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]`

### Loop Condition:
```
while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop condition depends on `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is 1, so `ans[i + 1]` refers to `ans[2]`.
   - `arr[i + 1]` refers to `arr[2]`.

### Loop Condition Evaluation:
- For the loop to continue, `ans[2]` must be less than or equal to `arr[2]`.

### Given Conditions:
- `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]`.
- `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `ans[2]` (which is `ans[1]`) must be less than or equal to `arr[2]`.
- Since `ans[2]` is already equal to `ans[1]`, the only thing that needs adjustment is ensuring `arr[2]` is such that the condition `ans[2] <= arr[2]` holds true.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `arr[2]` needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1; `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`; `ans[2]` must be less than or equal to `arr[2]`; `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]` and `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[2]`**
