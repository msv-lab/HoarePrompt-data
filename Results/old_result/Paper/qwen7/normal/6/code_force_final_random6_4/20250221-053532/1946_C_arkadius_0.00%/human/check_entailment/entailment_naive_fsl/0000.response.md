Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \). 

The main issue lies in the `func_1` and `func_2` functions, which do not correctly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size after removing edges. Specifically, these functions do not properly handle the process of removing edges and ensuring that the remaining components meet the size requirement.

To illustrate the problem, consider the following example:

### Example Input:
```
3 1
1 2
1 3
```

### Expected Output:
```
2
```

### Program Output:
The program would likely fail to produce the correct output because it does not correctly simulate the removal of edges and check the sizes of the resulting components.

### Explanation of the Issue:
- The `func_1` and `func_2` functions do not correctly simulate the removal of edges and update the sizes of the components.
- The `func_3` function checks if the number of good components is greater than \( k \), but it does not ensure that the remaining size of each component is at least \( x \).
- The `func_4` function uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \), but it relies on the incorrect logic in `func_3`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
