Postcondition: `ans` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is 4, and the current value of `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is 2, and the current value of `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.
