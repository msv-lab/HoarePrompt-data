Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\), `L` is a list of integers from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` is the length of the sublist `N`, `m` is updated to the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` pops the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to `w`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
