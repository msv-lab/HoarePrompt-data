Reasoning:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by first sorting the list of ticket prices `M`. It then determines how many days `q` are needed to buy `k` tickets given the constraint of buying up to `m` tickets per day. The logic involves calculating the cost based on the selected subset of days and adjusting the price increases accordingly.

However, the solution has several issues:
1. The logic for determining the cost is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `cost` does not correctly account for the price increases after purchasing tickets on a given day.
2. The approach of splitting the tickets across different days and handling the price increments is not fully implemented.
3. The code does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets purchased on a day causes the price to increase for subsequent days.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**
