Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers formed by splitting and converting the input string using map function, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.

The code `result = func_1(n, operations, queries)` calls the function `func_1` with three arguments: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. Since the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided, the value of `result` is the return value of this function call. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, and `queries` retain their initial states as they are not affected by the code snippet.
