Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; k is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]`.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the length of list `l` remains the same. The code `k -= dic[l[i]]` decreases the value of `k` by the value of `dic[l[i]]`, where `l[i]` refers to the element in list `l` at index `i`. Therefore, `k` is updated accordingly.
