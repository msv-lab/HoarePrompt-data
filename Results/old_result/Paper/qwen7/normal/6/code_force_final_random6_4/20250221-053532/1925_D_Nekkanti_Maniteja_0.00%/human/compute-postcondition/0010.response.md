Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `m` is still a positive integer, and `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers entered by the user.
