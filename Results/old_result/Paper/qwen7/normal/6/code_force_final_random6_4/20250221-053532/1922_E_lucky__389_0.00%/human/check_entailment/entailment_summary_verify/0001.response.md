### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be derived from its binary representation.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x`, which is `X - 1`.
   - It constructs the list `subseq_lens` to represent the binary representation of `x + 1`.
   - The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum value in `subseq_lens`.
   - The list `ansv` is constructed based on the values in `subseq_lens`.
   - Finally, the length of `ansv` and its elements are printed.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly converts `x + 1` to its binary representation and constructs the array based on this representation.
   - The array construction ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.
   - The code handles the special case where `x` is 0 by breaking out of the loop.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2, resulting in an array of length 1 with a single element 0.
   - For larger `X`, the code correctly constructs the array using the binary representation.

5. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` processes a single test case, constructs the necessary lists, and prints the results.

6. **Validation:**
   - Let's validate the logic step-by-step:
     - When `X = 2`, `x = 1`. The binary representation of `x + 1 = 2` is `10`. This results in an array `[0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
     - When `X = 5`, `x = 4`. The binary representation of `x + 1 = 5` is `101`. This results in an array `[0, 1]`, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[1, 0]`.
     - When `X = 13`, `x = 12`. The binary representation of `x + 1 = 13` is `1101`. This results in an array `[0, 1, 2]`, which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

   - The code correctly handles the construction of the array based on the binary representation of `x + 1`.
