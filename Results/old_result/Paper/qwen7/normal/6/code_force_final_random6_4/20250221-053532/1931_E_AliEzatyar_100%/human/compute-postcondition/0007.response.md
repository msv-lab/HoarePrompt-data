Output State: **`counter` is 0, `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, and `len(num)` must be at least 1, and the first character of `num` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their initial conditions remain unchanged.
