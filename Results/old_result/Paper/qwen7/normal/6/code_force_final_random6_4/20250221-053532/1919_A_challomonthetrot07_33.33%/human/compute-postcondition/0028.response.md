Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `a` is not equal to 1.
- `b` is not equal to 1.
- `a` is even.
- Either `a` is odd or `b` is even.

The print statement is `print('Alice')`.

The value being printed here is a string literal `'Alice'`. The values of the other variables (`T`, `i`, `a`, `b`) do not affect this specific print statement.

Output: **Alice**
