Based on the initial state provided:

- `den` is equal to `den - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0.

This means that `den` has been updated to be its original value minus the sum of all elements in the list `vprod`, and the result is still positive.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

This code does the following:
1. It creates a list comprehension that converts each element `x` in `vprod` to a string.
2. It joins these string representations with spaces.
3. It prints the resulting string.

Since the exact values of `vprod` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact printed output. However, we know that `vprod` is a list whose elements are converted to strings and then joined with spaces.

Output: **" ".join([str(x) for x in vprod]) (where vprod is a list of elements whose string representations are joined with spaces)**
