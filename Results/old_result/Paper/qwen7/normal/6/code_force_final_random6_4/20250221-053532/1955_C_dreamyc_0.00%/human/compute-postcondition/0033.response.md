Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements, `a` is the first element that was popped from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is the last element that was popped from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is decreased by the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b -= x` subtracts the value of `x` (which is the minimum of `a` and `b`) from `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
