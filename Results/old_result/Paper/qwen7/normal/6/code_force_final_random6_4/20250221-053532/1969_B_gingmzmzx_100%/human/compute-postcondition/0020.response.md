Postcondition: `ans` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `s` was 0 or not. If the first element of `s` was 0, `ans` is 2, `zeroes` is 1, and `cnt` is [2, 1]. If the first element of `s` was not 0, `ans` is 1, `zeroes` is 2, and `cnt` is [2, 1]. `s` loses its first element, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` must be greater than 0.
