Output State: **`lst[x]` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `lst[y]` is a non-empty list containing the element that was popped from `lst[x]`, and `y` is the element that was popped from `lst[x]`, `x` is now equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a block of code. In this case, it does not change the values of the variables `lst[x]`, `lst[y]`, `y`, and `x`. The state of these variables remains as described in the initial state.
