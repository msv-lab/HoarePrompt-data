### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation allows us to select a contiguous subarray and insert its sum into the array.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, and the result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Inserting the sum of a subarray can significantly increase the array's sum.
   - The optimal strategy often involves inserting sums of positive subarrays multiple times.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is used correctly in the main logic to ensure the final result is within the required range.
   - **func_2**: This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray. However, it has some issues:
     - It does not handle negative subarrays correctly.
     - It only considers one segment at a time and does not explore combining different segments to form larger segments.
     - It does not account for the possibility of inserting the sum of multiple subarrays.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum, we should consider the sum of the entire array and the sum of positive subarrays.
   - We can insert the sum of the entire array multiple times to increase the overall sum.
   - For negative subarrays, we should avoid them since they decrease the sum.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Calculate the sum of the entire array.
   - Calculate the sum of all positive elements.
   - Determine how many full insertions of the entire array can be made within `k` operations.
   - Handle the remaining operations by inserting the sum of positive subarrays if possible.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code shows that `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum subarray. However, the logic is flawed:
     - It does not handle negative subarrays correctly.
     - It only appends the last segment found to `segments_variants`, which may not be the optimal segment.
     - It does not explore combining different segments to form larger segments.
   - The main logic in the annotated code uses `func_2` to get a segment and then calculates the result incorrectly. It multiplies the segment sum by \(2^k\) and subtracts the segment sum, which is not the correct approach.

7. **Correct Solution**:
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the sum of the entire array and the sum of all positive elements.
   - Determine how many full insertions of the entire array can be made within `k` operations.
   - Handle the remaining operations by inserting the sum of positive subarrays if possible.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray, especially for handling negative subarrays. The main logic also uses `func_2` incorrectly.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
