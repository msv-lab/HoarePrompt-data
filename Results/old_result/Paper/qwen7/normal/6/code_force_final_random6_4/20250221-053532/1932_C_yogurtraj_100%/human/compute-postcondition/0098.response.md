Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The variable `i` retains its initial value of -1, and the variable `k` is not defined or modified by this line of code. Therefore, the only changes are to the values of `n` and `m`, which are set to the integers entered by the user.
