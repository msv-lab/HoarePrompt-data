Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from converting a binary string input into integers, and the length of `s` is at least 2; `n` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] == 1:
        n += 1
    if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
        ans += n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers, and `n` is incremented by 1 if the value of `s[i]` is 0 and `n` is not 0. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers, `i` is two more than the previous value, `n` is one more than its previous value. If `s[i]` equals 0 and `n` is not 0, then `i` is incremented by one, `n` is incremented by one, and `ans` is updated by adding `n + 1` to its current value. If the condition `s[i] == 0 and n != 0` is not met, the values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers, `i` is three more than the previous value, and `n` is either one more than its previous value (if `s[i] != 1` and `s[i] == 0`) or two more than its previous value (if `s[i] == 1` or `s[i] != 0`). Additionally, `ans` is the sum of the previous value of `n` plus 2 if the condition `s[i] == 0 and n != 0` is true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
