Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the last element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 1, and `rdb` is an empty iterable, `lft` is a slice of `lst` from the beginning up to index `n`.**

Explanation: The code `lft = lst[:n]` creates a slice of the list `lst` from the start up to but not including the index `n`. The values of `sng`, `elem`, `sz`, `rdb`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The new variable `lft` is created and assigned the slice of `lst` up to index `n`.
