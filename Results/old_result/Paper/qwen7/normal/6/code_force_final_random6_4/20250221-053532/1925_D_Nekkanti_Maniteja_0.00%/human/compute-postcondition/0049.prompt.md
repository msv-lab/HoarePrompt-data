Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `m`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `1000000007`, `M` is `1000000007`, `s` is `0`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values obtained from the split inputs over all iterations.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `m` because the loop runs from `0` to `m-1`. The variable `a` accumulates the value of `f` from each iteration of the loop, so it will be the sum of all `f` values provided as input. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `c`, `M`, `s`, `u`, `v`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body or head.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `1000000007`, `M` is `1000000007`, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \((n * (n - 1)) // 1\) modulo \(1000000007\), `M` is \(1000000007\), `s` is \(2 * c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a\)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \((n * (n - 1)) // 1\) modulo \(1000000007\), `M` is \(1000000007\), `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
