Postcondition: `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l+1]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[l]` equals 0 and `a[r]` equals 0. If `a[r]` does not equal 0, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`. If the condition `mi * 2 <= k` is not met, `k` remains unchanged, `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` remains unchanged, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
