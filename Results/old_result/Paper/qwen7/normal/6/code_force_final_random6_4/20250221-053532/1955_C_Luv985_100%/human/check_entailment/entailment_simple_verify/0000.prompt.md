You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #- `l` and `r` are such that they either point to the last remaining non-zero element in `a` or are out of bounds if all elements in `a` have become zero.
    #- `ans` is the total count of zeros in the list `a` after all iterations. It is incremented by `1` for each zero encountered in `a[l]` or `a[r]` when `l` equals `r`, and also by `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]` when `l` equals `r`.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations, the list `a` will contain only zeros and possibly some positive integers, `l` and `r` will point to the last remaining non-zero elements or be out of bounds, and `ans` will be the total count of zeros in `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Specifically, the logic for handling the attacks is flawed. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Attack Logic**: The program attempts to reduce the durability of both the first and last ships simultaneously in each iteration. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the Kraken's behavior, which alternates between attacking the first and last ships until one of them sinks.

2. **Handling Sunk Ships**: The program does not properly handle the scenario where a ship sinks. Once a ship sinks, it should no longer be subject to further attacks. The current implementation continues to decrement the durability of the first and last ships without checking if they have already sunk.

To illustrate, consider the example provided in the problem description:

- **Example Input**: `n=4`, `k=5`, `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`
- **Expected Output**: `2` (as explained in the problem description)

However, the provided program would not produce the correct result because it does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks and handle the sinking of ships properly.

Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description more accurately:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    while T:
        T -= 1
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        ans = 0
        
        while l <= r and k > 0:
            if l == r:
                if k >= a[l]:
                    ans += 1
                break
            
            if k >= a[l]:
                k -= a[l]
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            else:
                a[l] -= k
                k = 0
            
            if k >= a[r]:
                k -= a[r]
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                a[r] -= k
                k = 0
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly simulates the Kraken's alternating attacks and handles the sinking of ships appropriately.
