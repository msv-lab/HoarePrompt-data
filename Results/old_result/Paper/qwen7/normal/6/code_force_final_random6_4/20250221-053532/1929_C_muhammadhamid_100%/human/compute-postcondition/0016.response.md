Output State: **`k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is x + 2, `s` is updated to its current value plus the integer division of `s` by `k-1` plus 1.**

Explanation: The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the given code. The variable `s` is updated by adding the result of `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. The values of `k` and `x` remain as integers entered by the user, and `i` is still `x + 2`.
