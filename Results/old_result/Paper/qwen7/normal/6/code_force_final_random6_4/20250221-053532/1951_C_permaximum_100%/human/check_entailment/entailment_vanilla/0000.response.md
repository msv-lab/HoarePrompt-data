Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves purchasing tickets over multiple days with increasing prices based on the number of tickets bought on any given day. The goal is to minimize the total cost of buying `k` tickets.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost of buying `k` tickets.
   - In `func_1`, a priority queue (min-heap) is used to always consider the cheapest available ticket price.
   - The algorithm iteratively buys tickets starting from the cheapest available price, updating the price increase and total cost accordingly.
   - The logic to calculate the number of tickets to buy each day (`min(m, k - tickets_bought)`) ensures that the maximum allowed tickets per day are bought unless fewer are needed to reach `k`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the algorithm always considers the lowest possible price for the next ticket purchase.
   - The logic for updating the price increase after each purchase is correctly implemented.
   - The overall structure of the algorithm matches the problem requirements and examples provided.

Given this analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
