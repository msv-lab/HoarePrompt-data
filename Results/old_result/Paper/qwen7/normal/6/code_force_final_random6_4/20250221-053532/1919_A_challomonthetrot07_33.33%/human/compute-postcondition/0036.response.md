Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 1 if `a` is 1 or even, and 0 if `a` is odd, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `b` equals 1, then `b` remains 1. Otherwise, `b` does not equal 1, and `a` becomes divisible by 2 if it is even, or `i` is set to 1 if `a` is odd. If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` remains unchanged, otherwise `a` is set to 0.
