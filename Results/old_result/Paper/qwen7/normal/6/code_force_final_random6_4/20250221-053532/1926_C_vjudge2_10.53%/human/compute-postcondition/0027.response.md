Output State: **`total` is 9, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 5, `values[0]` is 0, `values[3]` is 3, `values[4]` is 4, `sum_values[2]` is 1, `sum_values[3]` is 4, `sum_values[5]` is 9**

Explanation: The line `sum_values[i] = total` updates the value of `sum_values` at index `i` to be equal to `total`. Given that `i` is 5 and `total` is 9, `sum_values[5]` is now 9. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
