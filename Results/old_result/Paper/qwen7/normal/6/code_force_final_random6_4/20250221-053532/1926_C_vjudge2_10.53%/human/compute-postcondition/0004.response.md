Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `numbers` is a list containing `n`.**

The code appends the value of `n` to the list `numbers`. Since `n` is an input integer, it is added to the existing list, making `numbers` a list that now contains `n`. The conditions and values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
