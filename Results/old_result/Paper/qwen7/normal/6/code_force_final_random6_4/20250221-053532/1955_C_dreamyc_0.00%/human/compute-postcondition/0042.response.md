Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` is non-zero, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements, `a` is the first element that was popped from `nums`, `b` is the last element that was popped from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b > 0` and `a > 0` with `k \geq 2 \times x`, then `k` is reduced by \(2 \times x\), `a` is adjusted by subtracting the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is decreased by the minimum of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged (either 1 or 2), and no changes are made to `k`, `a`, or `b`.
