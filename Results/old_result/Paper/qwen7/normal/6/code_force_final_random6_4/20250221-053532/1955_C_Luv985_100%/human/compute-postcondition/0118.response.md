Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[l]`. Here, `mi` is defined as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. After executing this line, `a[l]` will be updated to its new value, which is the original value of `a[l]` minus `mi`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
