Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is reduced by 2 times the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, the current value of `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, and `ans` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `mi`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their previous states according to the initial postconditions.
