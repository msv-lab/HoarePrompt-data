Output State: **`i` is 15, `c` is 14, `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1, 1, k0 - 3, 2, k0 - 7, 8, k0 - 15, 16, k0 - 31, 32, k0 - 63, 64, k0 - 127, 128, 0, 0]`, `l1` is a list of strings from user input.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` takes a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The original values of `i`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The new variable `l1` is created and assigned the result of splitting the user's input.
