Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCasos`) and processes each test case individually. This is done using a loop that iterates over the range of `numCasos`.

2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes the necessary variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `pergunta`, and `x`). The type and values of these variables are consistent with the problem statement.

3. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m)` with the correct parameters. The function is designed to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people in the queue.

4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates backward through the list `a` (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - It updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]` when `i < m`.
   - It accumulates the minimum cost to move to the next position in `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.
   - After the loop, `pergunta` holds the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people, and `x` holds the total accumulated cost.

5. **Output**: The function prints the value of `pergunta`, which is the required output for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the logic correctly and matches the problem description. There are no apparent errors in the logic or variable handling.

Correctness: **True**
