Output State: **`st` is equal to `st + 1`, `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` must be greater than `l`, and `a[l + 1]` must be equal to `a[l + 2]`**.

Explanation: The variable `st` is incremented by 1. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, and the condition that `a[l + 1]` must be equal to `a[l + 2]` also remains valid.
