Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is greater than `n // 2`. According to the problem description, the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the maximum value of `x` can be `n // 2`. However, the program checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`, which fails when `x` is close to `n // 2`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 100` and `x = 50`. The settling pattern would be such that `x = 50` could correspond to several values of `k`, but the current implementation might miss some valid `k` values due to the condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly identifies all possible `k` values for any given `x` and `n`.
