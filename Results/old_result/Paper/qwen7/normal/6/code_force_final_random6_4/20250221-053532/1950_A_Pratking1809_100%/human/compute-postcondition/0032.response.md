Functionality: **The function reads multiple sets of three integers (a, b, c) from the user, each set corresponding to a test case. For each set, it checks if a < b < c or a < b > c. If the first condition is met, it prints 'STAIR'; if the second condition is met, it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all sets, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each set.**
