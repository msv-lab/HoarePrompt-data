Output State: **`index` is 18 + n, `PB` is an integer value from `data[5]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `PS` is an integer value from `data[8]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`.**

In this case, the variable `index` is incremented by the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `index` is the sum of its original value (18) and `n`. The rest of the variables (`PB`, `k`, `n`, `t`, `results`, `PS`, and `p`) retain their initial states.
