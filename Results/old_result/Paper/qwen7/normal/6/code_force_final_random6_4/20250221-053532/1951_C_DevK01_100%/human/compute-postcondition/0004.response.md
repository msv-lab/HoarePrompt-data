Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the first, second, and third elements of the list `L` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The values of `t` and `L` remain unchanged. The list `M` is also unchanged, as it was defined before the assignment statements.
