Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0.**

The code simply initializes `a` to 0. Since `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `s` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.
