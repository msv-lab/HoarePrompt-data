Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. It checks if the array is already non-beautiful by comparing adjacent elements. If any two consecutive elements are different, the array is not beautiful, and it sets `flag` to `False`.
4. If the array is beautiful, it calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. This is done by counting the maximum number of consecutive identical elements and subtracting this count from `n`. If the array is not beautiful, it prints `-1`.
5. However, there are issues with the logic in the annotated program:
   - The logic to determine if the array is beautiful is flawed. It only checks if any two consecutive elements are different, which is incorrect. A beautiful array should allow for the specified operation to make all elements the same.
   - The logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove is also incorrect. It assumes that removing the maximum number of consecutive identical elements will always result in the minimum removals, which is not necessarily true.
   - The state analysis after the loop is incorrect. The variable `ans` is supposed to hold the minimum number of elements to remove, but the logic to update `ans` is flawed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
