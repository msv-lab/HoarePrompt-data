Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program attempts to find a common divisor (HCF) of the multipliers and then distributes the coins based on this HCF. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
3
5
5 5 5 5 5
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
3
6 3 2
```

- Expected Output:
```
-1
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
-1
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
-1
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
-1
```

For the second test case, the program incorrectly calculates the distribution of coins. The multipliers are 7, 9, 3, 17, 9, and 13. The product of these multipliers is 1989 * 1547 * 4641 * 819 * 1547 * 1071, which is much larger than the required condition. The program does not correctly handle the distribution of coins to ensure the total bet is strictly less than the received coins for each winning outcome.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
