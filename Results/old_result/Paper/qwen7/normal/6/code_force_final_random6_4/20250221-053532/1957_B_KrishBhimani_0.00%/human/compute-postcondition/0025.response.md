Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, 3, and 4, `i` is 5.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero. After each iteration, `k` is right-shifted by one bit (`k = k >> 1`). This means that eventually, `k` will become 0. Given that the loop executed 3 times in the provided examples, we can infer that the original value of `k` was at least 4 (since shifting 4 by 3 bits results in 0). Therefore, after all iterations, `k` will be 0, `arr` will contain the sequence of `i` values generated during the loop (0, 1, 3, 4), and `i` will be incremented to 5.
