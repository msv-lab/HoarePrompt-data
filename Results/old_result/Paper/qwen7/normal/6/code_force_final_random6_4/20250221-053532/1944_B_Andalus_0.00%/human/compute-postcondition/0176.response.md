Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is increased by 1.
   - `sng` is a list containing either `lft[i]` (if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`), or `lft[i]` is added to `sng` (if `lft[i]` does not equal `lft[i - 1]`).
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `rgt` is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `ldb` is an empty list.
   - `rdb` is an empty list.
   - `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `lst` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `sng` is a list containing unique elements from `lft` starting from index `i`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `sng` will be updated based on the new value of `i` according to the rule: if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`, then `lft[i]` is not added to `sng`; otherwise, `lft[i]` is added to `sng`.
   - All other states (`rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sz`, `k`, `n`, `lst`, `lft`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop head.

4. **New State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `sng` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `sng`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `sng` is a list containing either `lft[i]` (if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`), or `lft[i]` is added to `sng` (if `lft[i]` does not equal `lft[i - 1]`)**.
