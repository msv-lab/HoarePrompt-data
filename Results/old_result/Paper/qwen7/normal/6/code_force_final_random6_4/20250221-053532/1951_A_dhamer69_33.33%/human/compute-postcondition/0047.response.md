Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If `n` equals 2, the program updates `s` to a new input string from the user and does not change `count_1`. Otherwise, the program updates `s` to a new input string from the user and checks if the new string `s` contains exactly one instance of '11'. If so, `count_1` remains unchanged; otherwise, `count_1` remains unchanged as well.
