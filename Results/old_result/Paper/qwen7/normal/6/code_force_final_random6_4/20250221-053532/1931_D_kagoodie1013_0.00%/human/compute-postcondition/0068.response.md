Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr` using the variable `num`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `num`:**
   - Initially, `num` is set to the last element of `arr`. This means that when the loop starts, `num` should be the last element of `arr`.

3. **Check Other Variables:**
   - `count`: This is incremented within the loop but its initial value (0) does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key`: These are derived from the initial `num` but their values are not relevant for the loop's execution condition.
   - `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`: These are dictionaries and their initial states do not affect the loop's execution.
   - `results`: This list is used to store the final value of `count` but its initial state does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `test_cases`: This is mentioned to have at least one more element, but this is not directly related to the loop's execution.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop starts with `num` being the last element of `arr`, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element to allow the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must have at least one element.
- `num` must be the last element of `arr`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `num` is the last element of `arr`**
