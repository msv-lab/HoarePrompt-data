Output State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is 1, `ans` contains [0, -1]**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `ans` contains `[1 << i]`. Since `i` is the next element in `arr` and `arr[0]` is 0, `1 << i` evaluates to `1 << 0`, which is 1. So, `ans` initially contains `[1]`.
- The code then appends `k - sum(ans)` to `ans`. Given that `k` is 0 and `sum(ans)` is 1 (since `ans` is `[1]`), `k - sum(ans)` evaluates to `0 - 1`, which is `-1`.
- After appending `-1` to `ans`, `ans` now contains `[1, -1]`.

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the initial description since `i` should be the next element in `arr` after the first element, which is 1, not 0. Assuming the intention was to start with `i` as the second element in `arr`, the correct initial `ans` would be `[1 << 1]`, which is `[2]`. Following the same logic, `k - sum(ans)` would be `0 - 2`, which is `-2`. But given the exact initial conditions provided, the final `ans` is `[1, -1]`.

Given the exact conditions provided, the output state is as described above.
