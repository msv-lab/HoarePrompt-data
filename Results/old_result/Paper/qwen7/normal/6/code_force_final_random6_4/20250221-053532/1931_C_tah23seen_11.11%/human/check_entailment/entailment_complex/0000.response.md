Reasoning:

The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation where all elements between indices \(i\) and \(j\) are set to a value \(x\). The cost of this operation is \((j - i + 1)\) burles.

However, the provided code does not actually perform the required operation to make all elements equal. Instead, it checks for consecutive equal elements and returns the distance between them or zero if no such pair exists. This approach does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal through a single operation that might not involve consecutive elements.

Here's a brief breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Operation**: The function `func_1` does not attempt to make the entire array equal by setting a segment to a value. It only checks for consecutive equal elements and returns the distance between them, which is not a valid solution to the problem.

2. **No Cost Calculation**: The function does not calculate the cost of any operation, let alone the minimum cost.

3. **No Handling of Multiple Values**: The function assumes that there are at most two distinct values in the array, but the problem allows for multiple distinct values, and the optimal solution might involve setting a segment to a different value than the existing ones.

Given these points, the provided solution does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
