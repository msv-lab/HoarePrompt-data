Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n + 1`. After all iterations, `dp` will contain `n - 1` elements. Each element in `dp` will be calculated based on the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)` for `i` from 2 to `n`, with the first two elements being 1.

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, `dp` will look like this:
- `dp[0]` will be 1,
- `dp[1]` will be 3 (since the second element is calculated as `(dp[0] + 2 * 1 * 0) % (7 + 10^9) = 1 + 0 = 1`, but the loop starts from index 1),
- Each subsequent element will follow the given recurrence relation.

The final state of `dp` will be a list of length `n - 1`, with each element computed based on the previous two elements modulo \(7 \times 10^9 + 7\).
