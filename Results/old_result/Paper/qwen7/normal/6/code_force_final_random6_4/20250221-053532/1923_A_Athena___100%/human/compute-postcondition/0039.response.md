Output State: **`res` is 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes `res` to 0, which means the value of `res` is now 0. The values of `_`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
