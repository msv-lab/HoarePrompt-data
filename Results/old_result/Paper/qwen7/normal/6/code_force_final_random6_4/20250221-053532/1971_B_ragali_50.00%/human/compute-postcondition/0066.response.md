Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the last character in the string `s.strip()`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - **Variable `i`**: Since the loop is iterating through each character in `s`, the next value of `i` would be the second-to-last character in `s.strip()`.
   - **Variable `s`**: The string `s` remains the same throughout the loop iterations because the loop does not modify `s`.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `newstr`) are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given these points, we can now formulate the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

**State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is the second-to-last character in the string `s.strip()`, `s` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `a` is a set containing the element `i`, and `newstr` is either an empty string or equal to `s.strip()`**
