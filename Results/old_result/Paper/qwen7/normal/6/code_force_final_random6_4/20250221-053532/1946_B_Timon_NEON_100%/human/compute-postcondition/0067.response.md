Output State: **`max_sum` remains -1, `arr` remains a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment ending at the last index of `arr`, `max_segment` is a segment with its first element being the maximum sum of any subsegment in `arr` and its second element being the end index of that subsegment, `segments_variants` is a list containing all possible segments that could be `max_segment`, and `max_segment[0]` is the highest sum found among all subsegments of `arr`; `segments_variants` now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` to `segments_variants`.
- `max_segment` is a segment with the highest sum found so far in `arr`.
- `len(arr) - 1` represents the last index of `arr`.
- Therefore, `segments_variants` now contains the updated list with the new segment appended.
