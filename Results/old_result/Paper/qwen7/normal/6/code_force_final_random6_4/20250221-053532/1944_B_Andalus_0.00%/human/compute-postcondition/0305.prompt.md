Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will continue executing as long as `sz` is less than `k` and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. Once `sz` reaches `k` or `k - sz` is less than 2, the loop will break. After all iterations, `sz` will be equal to `k` if it was able to increment by 2 each time, otherwise it will be 2. The variable `elem` will be set to the last element processed by the loop, and `rdb` will be an iterable with no elements left to process since the loop will stop when `sz` is no longer less than `k` or `k - sz` is less than 2.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sng` is a non-empty iterable (excluding the first element), `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1, and we continue the loop or if statement since `sz` is not yet greater than or equal to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
