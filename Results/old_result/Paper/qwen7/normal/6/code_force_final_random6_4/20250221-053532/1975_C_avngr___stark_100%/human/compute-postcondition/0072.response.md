Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `max` is 0, `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing three consecutive elements starting from index `i`, and `temp` is sorted, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `temp.sort()` sorts the sublist `temp` which contains three consecutive elements starting from index `i` in the list `a`. The sorting operation does not affect the values of other variables such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, and `i`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged. The only change is that the sublist `temp` is now sorted.
