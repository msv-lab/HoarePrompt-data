Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `first` remains `False`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`.

4. **Analyze the Loop Body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `i` is not a key in `mpp` or if `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is true, the function breaks out of the loop.

5. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.
   - `first` remains `False` as per the postcondition.
   - `arr` and `mpp` are updated based on the new input, but their exact values are not specified in the postcondition, so we cannot change them directly.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`first` remains `False`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`**.
