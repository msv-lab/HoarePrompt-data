Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `num` is a list or array, `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from index 0 up to `n-2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, the only effect is that the program exits the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their previous values.
