Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` expects the input to be a list of integers separated by spaces, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. For example, the input "10" should be treated as a string, not a list of integers.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Cyclic Shifts**: The logic in `func_1()` does not account for the cyclic nature of the shifts. It simply counts the number of 1s before encountering a 0 and adds the count plus one to the answer. This approach will not work for strings that require multiple cyclic shifts to become sorted.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input "10", the correct output should be 2 (as explained in the problem statement), but the function will incorrectly compute this.
   - For the input "11000", the correct output is 0 (the string is already sorted), but the function will incorrectly compute a higher value.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the minimum cost to make the binary string sorted. This involves identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculating the cost of cyclic shifts for the remaining part of the string. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n and s[i] == '0':
        i += 1
    j = i
    while j < n and s[j] == '1':
        j += 1
    while j < n:
        k = j
        while k < n and s[k] == '1':
            k += 1
        if k < n:
            ans += k - j + 1
            j = k
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

func_2()
```

This corrected version properly handles the cyclic shifts and calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
