Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `a`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is set to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.
