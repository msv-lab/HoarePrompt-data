Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the string input by the user, `b` is the second integer from the string input by the user, `s` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `s` into a list of substrings using space as the delimiter (`s.split()`). It then converts the second element of this list (which is the second integer from the original string) into an integer and assigns it to `b`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it was initially set to the first integer from the string input by the user, and `s` remains unchanged as well.
