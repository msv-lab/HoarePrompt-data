The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` as input. It processes the list based on the specified bit position and returns one of three values: the length of the list `cur_arr`, the maximum value between the result of a recursive call with the previous bit position and the length of a new list, or -1.
