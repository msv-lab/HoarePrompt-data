Based on the initial state provided, we know that `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`. However, the specific values of `elem` and `k` are not explicitly stated. Therefore, we need to consider the general form of the output.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

This will print `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of its role in the context of the problem.

Output: **elem elem**
