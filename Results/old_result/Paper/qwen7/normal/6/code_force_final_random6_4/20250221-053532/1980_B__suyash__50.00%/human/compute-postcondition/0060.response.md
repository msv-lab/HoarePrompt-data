Based on the initial state provided:

- `fav` is an integer.
- `i` is `i_end + 2`.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `k` is decreased by the value at index `i_end` of list `l` or by `dic[l[i_end]]` if `fav` equals `l[i_end]`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
