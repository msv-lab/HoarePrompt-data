Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1 and must still be greater than 0, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true, `end` is 3**

Explanation: The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Initially, `end` is 2, so after executing the code, `end` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
