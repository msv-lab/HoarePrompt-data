Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `index` is `18 + 3 * n + 8 + 2 * n`, `PB` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times, `PS` is now `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - 3 * n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - 3 * n` to `index - 3 * n + 3 * n` into integers.

This output state describes the final condition of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The `index` variable will be at the position `18 + 3 * n + 8 + 2 * n` because it increments by 4 each iteration and by `2 * n` in total over 3 iterations. The `results` list will contain the return value of `func_1` three times since the loop appends the same result to the list in each iteration. The `PB`, `k`, `n`, `t`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` variables will reflect their values after the last iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times, `result` is the third element in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times, `result` is the first element in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
