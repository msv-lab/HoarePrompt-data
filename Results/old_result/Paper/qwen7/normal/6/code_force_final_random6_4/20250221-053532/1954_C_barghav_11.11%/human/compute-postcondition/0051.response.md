Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to 1.
2. `b` is a list with at least 2 elements. Since the exact elements of `b` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `b[i]`.
3. The `print` statement uses `end=''` which means no newline will be added after printing the value.

Given that `i` is 1, `b[i]` refers to the second element of the list `b` (since list indices start from 0).

Output: **b[1]**
