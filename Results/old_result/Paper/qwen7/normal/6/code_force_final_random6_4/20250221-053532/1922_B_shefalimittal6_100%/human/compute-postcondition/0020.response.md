Output State: **`x` is the next integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `idx` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `x = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to `x`. It does not affect the values of `n`, `idx`, or `v[x]` directly, but it updates `x` to be the integer value of `data[idx]`. The `idx` is also increased by 1 twice as part of the precondition, which remains unchanged in the output state. The value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1, but since the exact value of `v[x]` was not specified, it is only noted that it has been incremented.
