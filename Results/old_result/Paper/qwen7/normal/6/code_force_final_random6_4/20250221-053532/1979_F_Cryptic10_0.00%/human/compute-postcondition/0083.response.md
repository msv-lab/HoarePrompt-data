Output State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`, `d` is `-1`, `n` is still greater than `0`, `v` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(d)`, and we continue with the next iteration or part of the program since no break or exit was specified.**

In this output state, the variable `v` is updated to the value returned by the function `func_1(d)`, where `d` is `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state, and the program continues its execution.
