Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is a loop variable that starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` is determined by user input.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, the loop will execute as long as `0 < int(input())`.
   - Therefore, `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

5. **Consider the constraints on `t` and `n`**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).

6. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The value of `int(input())` should be within the range of valid inputs for `t` or `n`, but since the loop condition is based on `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is a valid positive integer.

Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is a valid positive integer. The other variables (`t` and `n`) do not directly affect the loop execution condition.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `int(input())` must be a positive integer**
