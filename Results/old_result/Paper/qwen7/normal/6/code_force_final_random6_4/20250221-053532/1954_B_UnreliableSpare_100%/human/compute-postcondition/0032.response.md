Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given code are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the value at index `i` in `arr` is equal to `val`. Otherwise, `cnt` is set to 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, `i` will be increased by 1 from its current value.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `n`.
   - `cnt` will be adjusted based on the value at the new index `i` in `arr`. However, since we are only asked to provide the state before the loop body is executed, we do not know the exact value of `cnt` yet. We only know that it will be updated based on the condition.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `cnt` is unknown but will be updated based on the value at the new index `i` in `arr`.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `cnt` is unknown but will be updated based on the value at the new index `i` in `arr`**.
