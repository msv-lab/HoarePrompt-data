Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element; xor is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`.**

Explanation: The code `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing the XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the current element `i` from the list `cur_arr`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values in `cur_arr`, the only change is that `xor` now holds the cumulative XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`.
