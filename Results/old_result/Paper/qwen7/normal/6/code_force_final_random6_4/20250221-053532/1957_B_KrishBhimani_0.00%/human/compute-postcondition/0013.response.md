Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is `while k:`. This means the loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero.

2. **Identify the relevant states**: The relevant states for the loop head are `k` and `k0`.

3. **Understand the current state**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is half of its original value (`k0 >> 1`), where `k0` is the original value of `k`.
   - `arr` is a list containing the integer 0.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is non-zero. Since `k` is half of its original value (`k0 >> 1`), for the loop to continue, `k` must be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `k` is still non-zero. Given that `k` is half of `k0`, we need to ensure that `k0` was originally set to a value such that `k0 >> 1` is still non-zero.

Since `k` is derived from `k0` and `k0` is the original value of `k`, we need to ensure that `k0` is at least 2 (because `k0 >> 1` would then be 1, which is non-zero).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k0` to ensure that `k` remains non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is half of its original value (k0 >> 1), `k0` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list containing the integer 0, `i` is 1**
