Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
- `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM'.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `h` is either 12 or an input integer (not equal to 0).
- `m` is an input integer.

We need to determine the values of `h` and `m` after any necessary adjustments, and the value of `day`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Adjusting `h` and `day`:**
   - If `h` is 0, it is set to 12 and `day` becomes 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, `day` becomes 'PM' and `h` is adjusted to be within the range 1 to 12.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM' and `h` is set to 12.

2. **Formatting the Output:**
   - The `print` statement formats the time as `hh:mm` where `hh` is `h` and `mm` is `m`.
   - Both `h` and `m` are zero-padded to two digits using `:02d`.

Given these rules, let's consider the possible scenarios for `h` and `m`:

- If `h` is 0, it will be set to 12 and `day` will be 'AM'.
- If `h` is greater than 12, it will be adjusted to a value between 1 and 12, and `day` will be 'PM'.
- If `h` is between 1 and 12, `day` will be 'AM' and `h` will be set to 12.

Since the exact values of `h` and `m` are not specified, we can only describe the general format and the conditions under which they are adjusted.

### Output Description:

The output will be a string in the format `hh:mm AM/PM`, where `hh` is the hour adjusted according to the rules described, and `mm` is the minute, both zero-padded to two digits.

Output: **'12:00 AM' if h is 0, otherwise 'hh:mm AM' if h is between 1 and 12, and '12:mm PM' if h is greater than 12 (where hh and mm are the adjusted values of h and m respectively)**
