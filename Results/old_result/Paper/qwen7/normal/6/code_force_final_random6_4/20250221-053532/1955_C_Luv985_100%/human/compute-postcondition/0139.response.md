Output State: **`mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`; `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[r]`. Since `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are already adjusted by subtracting `mi`. Therefore, `a[r]` is further reduced by `mi`. The value of `mi` remains unchanged, and `a[l]` is already updated to `a[l] - mi`.
