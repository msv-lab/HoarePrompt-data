Output State: **`k` is `k - 1`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value (0) and `cur + k * a[s[0]]`, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `s` is a list of integers representing the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`, `cur` is `cur + a[s[0]]`, `vis` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `1` at index `s[0]` and all other elements are `0`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values or expressions as they were in the initial state.
