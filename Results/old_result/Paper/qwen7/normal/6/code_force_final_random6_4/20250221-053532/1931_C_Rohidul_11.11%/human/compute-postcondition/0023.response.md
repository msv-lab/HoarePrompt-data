Output State: **`end` is increased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 3`, `a[r - 1]` is equal to `a[r - 2]**.

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since `l` was previously defined as `r - 2`, the new value of `l` is now `r - 3`. The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` still holds true because the value of `r` has only decreased by 1, not affecting the equality between `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
