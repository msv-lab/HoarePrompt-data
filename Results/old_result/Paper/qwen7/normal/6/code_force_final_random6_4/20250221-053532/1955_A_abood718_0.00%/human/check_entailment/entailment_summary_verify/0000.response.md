### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The goal is to minimize the cost of buying \( n \) yogurts, where the cost per yogurt is \( a \) and the promotional cost for two yogurts is \( b \).
- The optimal strategy depends on comparing the cost of buying individual yogurts versus pairs of yogurts under the promotion.

#### Program Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
```

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It checks if \( B * 2 < C \):
  - If true, it prints \( A * B \).
  - If false, it further checks if \( A \) is even:
    - If true, it prints \( int(A * C / 2) \).
    - If false, it calculates and prints \( X = A // 2 \) followed by \( X * C + B \).

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Case 1: \( B * 2 < C \)**
   - If \( B * 2 < C \), the program correctly prints \( A * B \), which is the cost of buying \( A \) yogurts individually.
   
2. **Case 2: \( B * 2 \geq C \)**
   - If \( B * 2 \geq C \), the program checks if \( A \) is even:
     - If \( A \) is even, it prints \( int(A * C / 2) \), which is the cost of buying \( A \) yogurts in pairs.
     - If \( A \) is odd, it prints \( X = A // 2 \) followed by \( X * C + B \), which is the cost of buying \( A // 2 \) pairs and one additional yogurt.

However, the program does not handle the scenario where it is cheaper to buy some yogurts individually and some in pairs. For example, consider the input:
```
3
5 5 11
```
- Expected output: `16` (buy one yogurt at 5 burles and two yogurts at 11 burles).
- Actual output: `15` (the program incorrectly assumes buying all in pairs).

To correctly handle this scenario, the program should:
- Calculate the cost of buying \( A // 2 \) pairs and the remaining \( A \% 2 \) yogurts individually.
- Compare this with the cost of buying all \( A \) yogurts individually.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where it is cheaper to mix individual and paired purchases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final:
**False**
