Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, `n` will be an integer equal to the first number entered in the last iteration, and `k` will be an integer equal to the second number entered in the last iteration.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as the total number of iterations and is decremented by 1 in each iteration. The values of `n` and `k` will be those from the last iteration of the loop, as these variables are only initialized at the start of each iteration and are not modified within the loop body unless specified conditions are met, but the loop does not change their values once set.
