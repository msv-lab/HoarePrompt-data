Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the last element of list `a`.**

The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to the variable `x`. However, the initial state does not provide the actual value or content of list `a`, so we can only say that `x` is the last element of `a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
