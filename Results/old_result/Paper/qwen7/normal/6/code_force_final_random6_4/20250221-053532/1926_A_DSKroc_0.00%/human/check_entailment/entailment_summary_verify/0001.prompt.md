You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) and an input string `s` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string `s`. After processing, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', and prints 'B' otherwise. The function does not modify the input string `s` and returns nothing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Counting Characters:**
   - For each test case, it initializes two counters `ac` (for counting 'A') and `bc` (for counting 'B').
   - It reads a string `s` of length 5.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s` and increments the appropriate counter (`ac` or `bc`) based on whether the character is 'A' or 'B'.
   
3. **Determining the Most Frequent Character:**
   - After counting the characters, it checks which counter is greater.
   - If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- The problem specifies that there are 8 test cases with specific input strings.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop.
- The program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' correctly within each test case.
- The logic for determining the most frequent character is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

### Testing the Program with Provided Example:

Let's run the program with the provided example to ensure it works as expected:

```plaintext
Input:
8
ABABB
ABABA
BBBAB
AAAAA
BBBBB
BABAA
AAAAB
BAAAA

Output:
B
A
B
A
B
A
A
A
```

The program produces the correct output for all the provided test cases.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis and testing, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') in each test case.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
