Postcondition: `segments_variants` must include at least one element (the new variant), `segment` is the new variant, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found so far, `max_sum` remains -1, `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment` if `segment[0]` is greater than `total_max_segment[0]`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.
