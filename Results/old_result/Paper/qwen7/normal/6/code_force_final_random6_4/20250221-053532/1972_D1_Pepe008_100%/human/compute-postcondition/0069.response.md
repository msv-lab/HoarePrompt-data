Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 1.
- `a` is `int(info[0])`, meaning `a` is the integer value of the first element in the `info` list.
- `b` is `int(info[1])`, meaning `b` is the integer value of the second element in the `info` list.
- `i` is `b + 1`, so `i` is `int(info[1]) + 1`.
- `x` is undefined, meaning it is not initialized or used in the given context.
- `suma` is the sum calculated over all iterations of the loop, but since no loop is mentioned in the given snippet, `suma` is not defined or initialized in this context.

Given the print statement `print(suma - 2)`, since `suma` is not defined or initialized, it cannot be used in the expression. Therefore, the print statement will result in an error or an undefined behavior, but if we assume it should print something based on the context provided, we would say it attempts to print `suma - 2` where `suma` is undefined.

Output: **Error or undefined behavior (since `suma` is not defined)**
