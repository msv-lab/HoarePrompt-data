### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that both strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not.
   - A template `t` can consist of lowercase or uppercase letters.
   - If a template character is lowercase, the corresponding characters in `a`, `b`, and `c` must match.
   - If a template character is uppercase, the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` must not match the lowercase version of the template character.

2. **Analyzing the Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if there is any position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`.
   - If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such position exists, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`. It does not consider the case where `t[i]` is uppercase.
   - For a template to work, we need to ensure that:
     - Both `a` and `b` match the template.
     - `c` does not match the template.
   - The current implementation does not check these conditions properly.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to create a template where:
     - For each position `i`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, we can set `t[i]` to be lowercase and equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`, we can set `t[i]` to be uppercase.
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and equal to `c[i]`, we cannot form a valid template.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`. However, the original assessment incorrectly concluded that the function is incorrect because it only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`. The annotated code confirms that the function returns 'NO' if no such position exists, which aligns with the requirement that both `a` and `b` should match the template and `c` should not.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided function `func_1` actually implements the correct logic. It checks if there is any position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`, which is a necessary condition for the template to exist. If no such position exists, it correctly returns 'NO', indicating that a valid template cannot be formed.

### Correctness:
**True**
