Output State: **`s` is a list of integers, `i` is three more than the previous value, `n` is one more than its previous value if `s[i] != 1` is true, otherwise `n` is two more than its previous value, `ans` is the sum of the previous value of `n` plus 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans += n + 1` increments `ans` by the value of `n + 1`. Since the initial conditions for `i` and `n` are given based on the condition `s[i] != 1`, these conditions remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to include the new value of `n + 1`.
