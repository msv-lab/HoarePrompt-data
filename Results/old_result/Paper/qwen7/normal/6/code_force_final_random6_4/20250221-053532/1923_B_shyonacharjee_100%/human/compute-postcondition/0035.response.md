Output State: **`can_survive` remains True, `bullets_used` is the sum of all `health` values in the `monsters` list, `monsters` is an empty list, `distance` is the absolute value of the `pos` from the last monster's position, `total_bullets_needed` is the final `bullets_used` value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the initial state of `monsters` is an empty list, the sum of all `health` values in the `monsters` list remains unchanged. All other variables (`can_survive`, `bullets_used`, `distance`, `total_bullets_needed`) remain in their initial states.
