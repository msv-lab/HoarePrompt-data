Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the second element of `arr`; `freq[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the frequency count of the element `i` in the `freq` list. Since `i` is the second element of `arr`, `freq[i]` (which is the same as `freq[1]` assuming `arr` is 0-indexed) is incremented by 1. The state of `arr` and the value of `i` remain unchanged, but the frequency count of `i` in `freq` is updated.
