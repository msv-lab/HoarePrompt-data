### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - The array elements are correctly converted into a list of integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`, meaning no rearrangement is needed.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns `False`, indicating that rearrangement is required.

3. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because no rearrangement is needed.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The program then calculates the beauty of the array by summing up `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from 1 to `num2 - 1`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - However, the function uses `num2` which is not defined in the function signature. This is a minor issue but doesn't affect the correctness of the logic.

- **Rearrangement Logic:**
  - The program sorts the array in ascending order before calculating the beauty.
  - Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` are minimized, which maximizes the overall beauty.
  - The beauty calculation `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from 1 to `num2 - 1` is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted (prints `0`).
  - It also correctly handles the case where the array needs to be rearranged (calculates the beauty correctly).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it in ascending order and then calculating the beauty. The function `func_1` is slightly flawed due to the unused parameter `num2`, but this does not affect the correctness of the main logic.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
