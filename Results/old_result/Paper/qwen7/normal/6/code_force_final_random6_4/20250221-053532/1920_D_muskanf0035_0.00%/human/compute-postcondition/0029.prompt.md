You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value), and queries is a list of positive integers representing the queries. op_type is either 1 or 2, where 1 indicates appending an integer to the end of the array, and 2 indicates appending x copies of the current array to the end. value is the integer to append when op_type is 1, and the number of copies to append when op_type is 2. The length of operations is equal to n, and the length of queries is equal to q.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations, `result` is an empty list, and `operations` is an empty list or contains tuples that have been fully processed.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `array` will contain all the values that were appended based on the operations provided, with each value being appended multiple times depending on the operation type (1 appends once, not 1 appends thrice). `result` remains an empty list as no operations modify it within the given loop. The `operations` list will be empty since all its tuples have been processed.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: `array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations, `result` is a list with `len(queries)` additional elements, each being `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` where `k` is each element of `queries` in order, and `operations` is an empty list since all its tuples have been processed.
    return result
    #The program returns a list 'result' where each element is calculated as array[(k - 1) % len(array)], with 'k' being each element from the queries list in order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of operations), `operations` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers indicating the type of operation and the value to operate with), and `queries` (a list of positive integers representing the queries). For each query, it calculates the value at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` in the array after performing all specified operations and returns a list of these calculated values.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list 'result' where each element is calculated as array[(k - 1) % len(array)], with 'k' being each element from the queries list in order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
