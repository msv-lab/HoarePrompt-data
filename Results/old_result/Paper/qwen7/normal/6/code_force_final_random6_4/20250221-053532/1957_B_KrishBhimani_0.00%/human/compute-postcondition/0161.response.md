Output State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` is 15, `c` is 16, `ans` contains [0, -1, 2, -2, 1, -4, 3, -8, 5, -16, 9, -32, 17, -64, 33, -128, 65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**.

Explanation: The code appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length matches the length of `arr`, which is 16. Initially, `ans` has 16 elements. Since the length of `ans` is already 16, no new elements are appended. Therefore, the values of `k`, `arr`, `i`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged except that `ans` now has 16 elements, all of which are zero at the end of the list.
