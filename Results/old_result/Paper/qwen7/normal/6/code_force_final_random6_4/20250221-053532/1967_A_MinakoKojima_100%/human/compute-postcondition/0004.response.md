Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`ans_list`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans_list` remains an empty list, `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, and `a` becomes a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
