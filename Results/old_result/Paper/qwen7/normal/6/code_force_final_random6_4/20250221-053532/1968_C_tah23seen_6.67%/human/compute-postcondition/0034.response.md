Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`.
   - `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]` and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`.
   - `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]` and `ans[i + 1]` is updated to be `ans[i]` which is `ans[1]`.

3. **Determine the relevant variables**:
   - The loop condition involves `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`.
   - Given `i` is 1, the relevant indices are `i + 1 = 2`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - From the given state, `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]` and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`.
   - Since `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]` and `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`, we know `ans[2]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`.
   - Therefore, `ans[2]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]` and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to this sum.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` must hold true.
   - Since `ans[2]` is already equal to `arr[2]` (because `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`), the loop condition is satisfied.
   - No changes are needed to the states to ensure the loop executes one more time.

6. **Final state**:
   - The states do not need to be adjusted further because the loop condition is already satisfied.

**Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1; `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`; `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]` and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`**
