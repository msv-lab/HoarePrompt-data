Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a cumulative sum (`suma`) based on a specific formula involving `a` and `i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `b`). If certain conditions are met during the calculation, 1 is added to `suma`. Finally, it prints the result of `suma - 2`. The function implicitly handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each test case involving integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 2 * 10^6 and the total sum of `a` and `b` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
