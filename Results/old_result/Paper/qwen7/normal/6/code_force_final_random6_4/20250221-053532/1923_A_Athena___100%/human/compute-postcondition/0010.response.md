Output State: **`res` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, the first element of `a` is no longer 0, `a` is now an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Initially, the first element of `a` was 0, but it is now removed, making `a` an empty list. The values of `res` and `_` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
