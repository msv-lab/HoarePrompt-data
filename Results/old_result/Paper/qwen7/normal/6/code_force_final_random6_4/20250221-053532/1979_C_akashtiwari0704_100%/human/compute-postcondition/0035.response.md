Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `bets`.
2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated by appending `str(a[i]) + ' '` to its current value.
   - `bets` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `bets-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.

4. **Analyze the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `bets` must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if `i` was previously less than `bets`, it will now be equal to `bets - 1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`, meaning `i` will be `bets - 1` and `bets` must remain greater than 0.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not directly involved in the loop head.
   - `i` will be `bets - 1`.
   - `bets` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`ans` is updated by appending `str(a[i]) + ' '` to its current value, `i` is `bets - 1`, `bets` must be greater than 0.**

State: **`ans` is updated by appending `str(a[i]) + ' '` to its current value, `i` is `bets - 1`, `bets` must be greater than 0**
