You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
Functionality: The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list. This list is formed by combining `output2` and the reversed version of `output1`. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `x`, adding pairs of divisors to `output1` and `output2`. After the loop, it reverses `output1` and concatenates it with `output2` before returning the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received for each test case.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even.
     - If `(n + x - 2)` is even, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)`.
     - If `(n - x)` is even, it calls `func_1(n - x)`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of `x`, including both the smaller and larger divisors.
   - The function iterates through numbers from `1` to `sqrt(x)` and collects divisors in `output1` and their corresponding pairs in `output2`.
   - It reverses `output1` and appends it to `output2`, ensuring all divisors are included.

4. **Processing Divisors:**
   - For each divisor `s` obtained from `func_1`, it checks if `(s + 2)` is even and if `(s + 2) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If both conditions are met, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.

5. **Removing Duplicates and Counting:**
   - The `output` list is converted to a set to remove duplicates.
   - The length of the set is printed, which gives the number of valid `k`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even correctly.
   - It ensures that only valid `k` values (where `k > 1`) are considered.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates all divisors of `x`.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `k` is even, which is necessary for the settling pattern.
   - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the calculated `k` fits the given position `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears to be correct based on the given problem description and constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
