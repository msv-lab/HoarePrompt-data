You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple sets of three integers (a, b, c) from the user, each set corresponding to a test case. For each set, it checks if a < b < c or a < b > c. If the first condition is met, it prints 'STAIR'; if the second condition is met, it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all sets, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each set.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. The conditions for a stair (a < b < c) and a peak (a < b > c) are accurately checked, and the "NONE" case is handled appropriately when neither condition is met. The program processes multiple test cases as specified and outputs the correct result for each case, as demonstrated in the example input and output. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
