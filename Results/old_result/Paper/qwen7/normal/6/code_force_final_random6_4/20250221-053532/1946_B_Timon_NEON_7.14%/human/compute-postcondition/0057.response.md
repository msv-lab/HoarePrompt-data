Output State: **`segments_variants` is either a list containing `max_segment + [i_new - 1]` or an empty list, `new_segment` is either `[arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or an empty list if `arr[i_new] < 0`, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or `[arr[i_new], max_segment[1]]` if `arr[i_new] < 0`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is `i_new`; `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.**

This means that the first element of `max_segment` (which was previously updated to `[arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or `[arr[i_new], max_segment[1]]` if `arr[i_new] < 0`) is now increased by the value of `arr[i]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
