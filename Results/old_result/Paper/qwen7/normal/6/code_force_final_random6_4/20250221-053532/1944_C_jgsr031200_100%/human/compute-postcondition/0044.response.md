Output State: **`cou` is 3, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block that was checking if `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2. The values of `cou`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
