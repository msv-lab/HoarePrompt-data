Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `ans` is a list of n elements, each initialized to 0; `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
    if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
        while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            ans[i + 1] += ans[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the length of `arr` - 1, and `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is -1; `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` is the sum of all elements in `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[length_of_arr - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the last index of `arr`; `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`; for each `ans[j]` where `j` ranges from 2 to `i + 1`, the value is doubled until it is no longer less than or equal to `arr[j]`, and finally `ans[i + 1]` is the last value that satisfies the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`, which is equal to the previous value of `ans[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
