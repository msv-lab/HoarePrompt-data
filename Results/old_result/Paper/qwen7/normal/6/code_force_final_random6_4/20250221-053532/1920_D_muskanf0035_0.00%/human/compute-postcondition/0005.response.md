Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of input integers formed by splitting the input string and converting it to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.

The code `result = func_1(n, operations, queries)` calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined here, the value of `result` is dependent on the implementation of `func_1`. However, the initial values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `queries` remain unchanged. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, and `result` is set to the return value of `func_1`.
