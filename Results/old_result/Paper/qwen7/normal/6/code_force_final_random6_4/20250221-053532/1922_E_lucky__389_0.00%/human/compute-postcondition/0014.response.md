Output State: `i` is 10, `x` must be at least 1023, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(2^{(i+1)} \leq x + 1\). Given that the loop executed 3 times with `i` reaching 3 when `x` is at least 7, we can deduce the general condition. Each iteration roughly doubles the lower bound of `x`. Therefore, after 10 iterations, `i` would be 10, and `x` would need to be at least \(2^{11} - 1 = 1023\).
