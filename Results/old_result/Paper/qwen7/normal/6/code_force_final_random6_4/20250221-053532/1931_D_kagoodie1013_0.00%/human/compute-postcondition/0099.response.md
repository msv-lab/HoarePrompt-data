Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each tuple, the function calculates the count value and updates the frequency of remainders when all numbers in the list `arr` are divided by `x` and `y`. Finally, the function returns a list of integers representing the count values for each test case, and it maintains two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to reflect the overall frequencies of remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.**
