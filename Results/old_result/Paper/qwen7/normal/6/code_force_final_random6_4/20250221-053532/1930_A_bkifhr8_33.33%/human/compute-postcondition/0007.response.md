Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n * 2)` will execute as long as `n * 2` is a positive integer.
   - This means `n * 2` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - Since `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n * 2 > 0`.
   - This implies that `n` must be a positive integer (i.e., `n > 0`).

4. **State the final modified state**:
   - The variable `ans` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it remains unchanged.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `l` and `lst` are not directly involved in the loop condition either, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`ans` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
