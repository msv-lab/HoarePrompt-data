Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `sng` contains at least one element.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `sng` must contain at least one element.
   - `sz` is `sz` + 1 (This seems to be an external state that is not directly related to the loop execution but might be relevant for context).

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `sng` must still contain at least one element.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, no changes are made to `elem` within the loop, so `elem` is not a variable we need to adjust.
   - `sz` is not part of the loop head and its value does not affect the loop continuation, so it remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `sng`, which must still contain at least one element.
   - `sz` remains as `sz` + 1 from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is `sz` + 1**
