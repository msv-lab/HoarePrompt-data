The only variables in the loop head are `elem` and `rdb`. Since the loop condition is based on the iteration over `rdb`, we need to consider how the loop affects these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`.
- If `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k - 2`, it is now exactly `k - 2` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `k - sz` is less than 2, `sz` is updated to `k` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop must continue as long as there are elements left in `rdb`.
- Therefore, `rdb` must still contain at least one element.

Since `elem` is the variable being iterated over, it will take on the value of the next element in `rdb` during the next iteration. However, the specific value of `elem` itself does not affect the loop continuation condition directly; it is the presence of elements in `rdb`.

Given the conditions provided, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the state of `rdb`.

State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`, `rdb` must still contain at least one element**
