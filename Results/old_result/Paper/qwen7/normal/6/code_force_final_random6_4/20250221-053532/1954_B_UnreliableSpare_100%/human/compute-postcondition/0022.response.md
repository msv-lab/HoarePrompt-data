Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `flag` remains False, `ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')`, `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `val` and `cnt`. `val` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. `cnt` is initialized to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
