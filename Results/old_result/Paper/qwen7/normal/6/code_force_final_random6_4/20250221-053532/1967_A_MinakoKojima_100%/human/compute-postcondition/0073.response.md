Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 3, `k` is 0, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, `res` is decremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `ans`, `i`, `k`, `dif`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
