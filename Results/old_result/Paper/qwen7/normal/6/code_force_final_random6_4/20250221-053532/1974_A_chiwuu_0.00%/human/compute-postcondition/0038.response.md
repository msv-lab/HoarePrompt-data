Postcondition: `t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2`. If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t` is decreased by 5. Otherwise, `t` is increased by 1 after integer division by 5.
