Output State: **`c` is 0, `x` is 1, `a` is equal to `l[1]`, `b` is equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `a`. Given that `x` is 1, `a` becomes `l[1]`. Since `b` was previously equal to `a`, `b` also becomes `l[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
