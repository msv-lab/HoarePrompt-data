Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is 12, `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
