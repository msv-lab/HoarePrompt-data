Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `k` from the `queries` list.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the `queries` list. Since `k` is taken from `queries`, the loop will continue if `queries` has at least one element left.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations.
   - `result` is a list with one additional element which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`.
   - `operations` is a list containing at least one tuple.
   - `k` is the second element of `queries`.
   - `result` has an additional element appended which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`.

4. **Determine the next value of `k`**: Since `k` is taken from `queries`, the next value of `k` will be the next element in the `queries` list. Given that `k` is currently the second element, the next value of `k` will be the third element in the `queries` list.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `k` will be updated to the third element of `queries`.
   - `result` will be updated to include the new element based on the new value of `k`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations, `result` is a list with one additional element which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, `operations` is a list containing at least one tuple, and `k` is the third element of `queries`, and `result` has an additional element appended which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`.**
