Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `word` is either 'aay' or 'aaa', and `i` is 2. If `n` is greater than 27, then `word` is 'az'. Otherwise, if `n` equals 27, `word` is set to 'aay', and if `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is set to 'aaa'.
