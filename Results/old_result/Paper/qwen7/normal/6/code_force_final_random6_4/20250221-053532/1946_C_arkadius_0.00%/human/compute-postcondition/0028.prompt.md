You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree with n vertices, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n, and the method func_3(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int, mid: int) returns a boolean indicating whether it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least mid.
def func_4(tree, n, k):
    beg = 1
    end = n
    while beg < end:
        mid = (beg + end + 1) // 2
        
        if func_3(tree, n, k, mid):
            beg = mid
        else:
            end = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final values of `beg` and `end` will be such that `beg` is less than or equal to `end`, and `end` is the largest integer for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns false when `mid` is calculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true for some `mid`, then `beg` will be equal to that `mid`. Otherwise, `end` will be the last value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returned false.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, `beg` and `end` will converge to a point where further division does not satisfy the condition of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, or they will be equal if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true for every possible `mid` within the range.
    return beg
    #The program returns the value of `beg`, which is the smallest integer such that `func_3(tree, n, k, beg)` returns true, or the last value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returned false if no such `mid` exists.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `tree` (an instance of the Tree class), `n` (a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree), and `k` (a positive integer representing the number of edges to remove). It returns the smallest integer `beg` such that `func_3(tree, n, k, beg)` returns `True`, or the last value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returned `False` if no such `beg` exists.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `beg`, which is the smallest integer such that `func_3(tree, n, k, beg)` returns true, or the last value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returned false if no such `mid` exists.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
