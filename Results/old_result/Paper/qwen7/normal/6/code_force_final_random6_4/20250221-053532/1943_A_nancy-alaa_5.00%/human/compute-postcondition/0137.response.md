Postcondition: `first` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is false, `first` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
