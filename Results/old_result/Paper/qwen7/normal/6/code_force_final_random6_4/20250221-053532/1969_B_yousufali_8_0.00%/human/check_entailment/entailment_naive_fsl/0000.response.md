Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to handle the given problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is attempting to split the input into groups of 1s and calculate the cost based on the length of these groups, which does not align with the requirement of performing cyclic shifts on substrings to sort the binary string.

For example, consider the input "101011":
- The function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 3 + 3 = 6, but the correct solution involves multiple cyclic shifts:
  1. Choose substring [1, 2]: "101011" -> "011011"
  2. Choose substring [3, 4]: "011011" -> "010111"
  3. Choose substring [5, 6]: "010111" -> "010111"
  The total cost is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, but the correct minimum cost is 9, as described in the example output.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality and is incorrect.
