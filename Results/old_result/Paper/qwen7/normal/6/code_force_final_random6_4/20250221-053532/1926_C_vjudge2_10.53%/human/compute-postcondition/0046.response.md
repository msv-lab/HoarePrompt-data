Output State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 10, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 13, `values[0]` is 0, `values[3] is 3, `values[4] is 4, `values[5] is 5, `values[6] is 6, `values[7] is 7, `values[8] is 8, `values[9] is 9, `values[10] is 10, `values[11] is 13, `values[12] is 13, `sum_values[2] is 1, `sum_values[3] is 4, `sum_values[5] is 9, `sum_values[6] is 15, `sum_values[7] is 24, `sum_values[8] is 35, `sum_values[9] is 45, `sum_values[10] is 55, `sum_values[11] is 11, `word` is '13', `last` is 3, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 13**

Explanation: The code `last = int(word[len(word) - 1])` extracts the last character of the string `word` which is '3', converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `last`. Therefore, `last` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
