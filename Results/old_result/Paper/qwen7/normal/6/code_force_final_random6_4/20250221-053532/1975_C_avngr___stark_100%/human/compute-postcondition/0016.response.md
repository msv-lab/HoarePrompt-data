Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is either equal to `temp[1]` (if the condition `temp[1] > max` is true) or remains unchanged (if the condition is false). `temp` is a slice of `a` sorted in ascending order starting from index `i` and ending at index `i+3`.
