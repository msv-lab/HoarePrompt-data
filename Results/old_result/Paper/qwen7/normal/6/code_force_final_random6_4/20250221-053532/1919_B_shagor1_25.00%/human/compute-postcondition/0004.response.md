Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n` that must be at least 1, `neg` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is '-', assuming `i` is within the bounds of `s`.**
