Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ldb` has the value `lft[3]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the value `lft[3]` is appended to `ldb`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
