Postcondition: `d` is `n - 2`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, and `path` either includes the value of `v` minus one occurrence or remains unchanged. If `v == 0`, we continue the most internal loop or if statement. If `v != 0`, we continue the most internal loop or if statement as well.
