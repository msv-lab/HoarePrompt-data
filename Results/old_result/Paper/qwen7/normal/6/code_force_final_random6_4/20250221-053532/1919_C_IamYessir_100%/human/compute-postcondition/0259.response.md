Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`, `y` is set to infinity.**

The code sets `y` to `float('inf')`, which means `y` is now infinity. All other variables retain their previous values.
