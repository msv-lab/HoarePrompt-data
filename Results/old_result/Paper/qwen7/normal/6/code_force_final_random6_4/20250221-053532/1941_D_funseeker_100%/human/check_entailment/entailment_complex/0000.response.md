### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**: This function reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns it. This function is used to read individual inputs like `t`, `r_i`, `c_i`, etc.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function returns an integer value calculated by `func_1()`. Given the context, it likely reads `t` (the number of test cases) and returns it.

3. **Function `func_3()`**: This function returns a list of integers extracted from the split result of the output of `func_1()`. Given the context, it likely reads `n`, `m`, and `x` (the number of players, number of throws, and starting player) and returns them as a list.

4. **Function `func_4()`**: This function is the core logic of the program. It:
   - Reads the number of players `n`, number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - Iterates through each throw, updating the set `ans` based on the distance `r` and direction `c` of the throw.
   - Handles both clockwise (`0`) and counterclockwise (`1`) directions, as well as unknown directions (`?`).
   - Ensures that if `0` is in the set `ans`, it is replaced with `n` to handle circular indexing.
   - Prints the number of possible positions the ball can be in and the sorted list of those positions.

Given the problem description and the annotated functions, the logic in `func_4()` correctly handles all aspects of the problem:
- It initializes the starting position correctly.
- It updates the possible positions based on the given directions.
- It handles circular indexing properly.
- It prints the correct number of possible positions and their sorted values.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
