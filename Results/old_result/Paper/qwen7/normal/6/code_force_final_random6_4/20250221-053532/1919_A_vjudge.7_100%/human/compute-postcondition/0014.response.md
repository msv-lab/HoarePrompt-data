Based on the initial state provided:

- `test` is an input integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
- `t` is 1.
- `a` is the first integer input.
- `b` is the second integer input.
- `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.

The `print('Alice')` statement will print the string "Alice" regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `test`.

Output: **Alice**
