Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `cnt` remains the count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each occurrence of `tmp` in the list `a` during the loop execution. Additionally, whether `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is greater than 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, the final values of `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` will satisfy these conditions.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts it into a list of integers named `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `cnt`, `ans`, `n`, or `tmp`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain as described in the initial state.
