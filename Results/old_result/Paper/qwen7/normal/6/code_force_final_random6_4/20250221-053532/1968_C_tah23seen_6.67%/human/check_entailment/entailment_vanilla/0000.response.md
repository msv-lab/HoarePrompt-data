Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find an array `a` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \leq i \leq n`. Given the constraints and examples, we need to ensure that our solution respects these conditions.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `arr` of `n-1` integers.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to compute the array `ans`.
   - The function `func_1` initializes the array `ans` with zeros.
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1` to ensure it's greater than `x_2`.
   - For each subsequent element, `ans[i+1]` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]`, ensuring that `ans[i+1] > arr[i+1]` and thus satisfying the modulo condition.
   - If `ans[i+1]` is less than `arr[i+1]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` until it is greater than `arr[i+1]`.
   - Finally, `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that `ans[i]` is always greater than `arr[i]`, which guarantees that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true.
   - The increment loop ensures that `ans[i+1]` is at least `arr[i+1] + 1`, which is sufficient to satisfy the modulo condition.
   - The final assignment for `ans[-1]` ensures the last element also satisfies the condition.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required logic to generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
