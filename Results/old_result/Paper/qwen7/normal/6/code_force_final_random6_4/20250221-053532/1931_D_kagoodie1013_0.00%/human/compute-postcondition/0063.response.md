Output State: **`count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map` values plus all `mod_y_map` values, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a remainder when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and each value is the count of occurrences of that remainder, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a remainder when elements of `arr` are divided by `y` and each value is the count of occurrences of that remainder, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`. Since `count` is already defined as the sum of all values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, and no other changes are made to `count`, `num`, `mod_x_key`, `mod_y_key`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, or `results`, these variables retain their previous states. The only change is that the value of `count` is now added to the `results` list.
