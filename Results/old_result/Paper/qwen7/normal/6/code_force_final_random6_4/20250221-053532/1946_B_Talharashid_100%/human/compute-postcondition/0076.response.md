Postcondition: `ele` is an integer and `c` is an integer. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to the absolute value of `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the previous value of `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
