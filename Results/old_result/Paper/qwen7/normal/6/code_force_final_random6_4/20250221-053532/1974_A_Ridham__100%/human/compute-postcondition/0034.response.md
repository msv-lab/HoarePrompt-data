Output State: **`remaining_cells` must be greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` assigns the value of `y // 2` (integer division of `y` by 2) to the variable `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
