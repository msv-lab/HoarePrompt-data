Output State: **All elements in `ldb` have been processed, `sz` is equal to or greater than `k`, and `rdb` is empty.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, since the loop breaks when `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, `sz` will be at least `k`. Additionally, since the loop processes elements from `rdb` and prints pairs of them until `sz` reaches `k`, all elements in `rdb` will be processed, making `rdb` empty. The initial state condition that all elements in `ldb` have been processed remains unchanged, so they are still processed.
