The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k` along with a list `M` of `n` integers. It then calculates a cost based on specific conditions involving `n`, `m`, and `k`. The cost is determined by sorting `M`, selecting a subset of elements, and performing arithmetic operations. After processing all test cases, the function prints the calculated cost for each case and terminates.
