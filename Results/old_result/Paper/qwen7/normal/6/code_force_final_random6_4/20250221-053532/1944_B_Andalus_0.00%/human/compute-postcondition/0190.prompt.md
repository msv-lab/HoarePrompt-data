Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rgt` is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `sng` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is increased by 1, `sng` is a list containing either `lft[i]` (if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`), or `lft[i]` is added to `sng` (if `lft[i]` does not equal `lft[i - 1]`). `n` is greater than 1, `rgt` is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `sng` is a list containing unique elements from `lft` starting from index `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1; `sng` is a list. If `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the value of `lft[i]` and `sng` is updated to contain either `lft[i]` (if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`) or an additional element `lft[i]` (if `lft[i]` does not equal `lft[i - 1]`). If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list with an additional element `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`; `sng` is a list. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list with the element `lft[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
