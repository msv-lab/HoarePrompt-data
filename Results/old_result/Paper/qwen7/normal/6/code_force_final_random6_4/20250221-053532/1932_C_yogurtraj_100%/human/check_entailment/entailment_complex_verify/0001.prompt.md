You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations. Therefore, `i` is -1; `k` is the final value of `k` after the loop completes, which is determined by the sequence of operations inside the loop based on the characters in `t` and the values in `a`. `q1` and `q2` are adjusted accordingly throughout the iterations. The list `y` is a list of `n` elements, where each element from index `0` to `n-2` (inclusive) is updated to the current value of `k` after the corresponding iteration of the loop, and the last element `y[-1]` is set to the final value of `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \), followed by \( n \) and \( m \) (both positive integers), an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting only of 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of values based on the given string \( s \) and array \( a \), and outputs this sequence as a list of integers. The final output for each test case is a list \( y \) of \( n \) elements, where each element is derived through a series of multiplications and modulo operations based on the characters in \( s \) and the values in \( a \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, initializes the array `a`, and reads the string `t`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - It calculates the number of 'L' commands (`l`) in the string `t`.
   - It sets up variables `k`, `q1`, and `q2` to handle the initial conditions based on the last character of the string `t`.

3. **Result Array Initialization:**
   - It initializes an array `y` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It sets the last element of `y` to the appropriate value based on the initial setup.

4. **Processing Commands:**
   - It iterates backward through the array `y` from `n-2` to `0`.
   - For each command, it updates `k` based on whether the command is 'R' or 'L'.
   - It adjusts the indices `q1` and `q2` accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - It prints the result array `y`.

### Detailed Reasoning

1. **Handling Initial Conditions:**
   - The program correctly handles the initial conditions for `k`, `q1`, and `q2` based on the last character of the string `t`. This ensures the correct starting point for the product calculation.

2. **Backward Iteration and Command Processing:**
   - The program iterates backward through the array `y`, which is correct because it processes commands from the end of the string `t` to the beginning.
   - For each command, it correctly updates `k` using the appropriate index (`q1` or `q2`), ensuring the product is calculated correctly modulo `m`.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program uses the modulo operation correctly to ensure the product remains within the required bounds.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the string ends with 'L' or 'R' correctly by setting the initial value of `k` and adjusting the indices appropriately.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the results in the correct format, printing each value of `y` separated by spaces.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all test cases as expected and produces the correct output.
