Output State: **`ans` is either 2 or 3; `sm` is `k`; `m` is less than `n`; `r` is `m + 1`; `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1 from its previous value; `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1; if `(ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]])` is true, then `ans` is 2 and `sm` is `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 2 and `sm` is `k`.**

Explanation: The code `sm -= 1` decrements the value of `sm` by 1. Initially, `sm` was either `k` or `k + 1`. After decrementing, `sm` becomes `k` (if it was `k + 1`) or `k - 1` (if it was `k`). However, since the condition `(ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]])` does not change due to this operation, the value of `ans` and `sm` remain as they were before the decrement. Therefore, `ans` remains either 2 or 3, and `sm` becomes `k` if it was `k + 1`, otherwise, it remains `k`.
