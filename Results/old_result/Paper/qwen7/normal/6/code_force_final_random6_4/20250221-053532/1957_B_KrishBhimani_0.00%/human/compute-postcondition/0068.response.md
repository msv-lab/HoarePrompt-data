Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` must be non-zero, `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integer 0 and 1, `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`. After this operation, `arr` contains the integers 0 and 1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
