Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` does not ensure that the conditions \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) are met for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\). Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Initialization**: The initial value for `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This might not always satisfy the condition \(x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1\).

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The loop that calculates subsequent values in `ans` does not correctly compute the modulo operation. Specifically, the line `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` and the subsequent adjustment loop do not guarantee that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\).

To fix this, we need to ensure that each \(a_i\) is chosen such that it satisfies the given modulo conditions. A correct approach would involve starting with a large enough value for \(a_1\) and then adjusting subsequent values to meet the modulo conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    # Start with a large value for a1
    ans[0] = 10**9
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Ensure a_i mod a_(i-1) = x_i
        ans[i] = ans[i-1] + arr[i-1] + 1
    return ans
```

This corrected version initializes `a_1` to a large value and then ensures that each subsequent `a_i` is chosen such that the modulo condition is satisfied.
