You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, m is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, k is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and prices is a list of n positive integers representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
    #State: Output State: `price_increase` is increased by the total number of tickets bought, `total_cost` is the sum of the cost of all tickets bought, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, `price` is the last price plus the final `price_increase`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought` for the last iteration, `day` is the `day` value popped from the priority queue `pq` during the last iteration.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `price_increase` will have been incremented by the total number of tickets bought across all iterations. The `total_cost` will be the cumulative cost of all tickets purchased. `tickets_bought` will equal `k`, indicating that all available tickets have been bought. The `price` will reflect the final price after all increments. `tickets_to_buy` will be the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets needed to reach `k` for the last iteration, and `day` will be the `day` value corresponding to the last ticket bought.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the total cost of all tickets bought, which is the cumulative sum of the cost of each ticket purchased over all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of sale days), `m` (a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end), and `prices` (a list of `n` positive integers representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days). It returns the total cost of all tickets bought, which is the cumulative sum of the cost of each ticket purchased over all iterations.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total cost of all tickets bought, which is the cumulative sum of the cost of each ticket purchased over all iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
