Output State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` anymore, `d` is -1, `v` is the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, `n` is still greater than 0, and `path` now includes the value of `v` twice.**

Explanation: The line `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the value of `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. The values of `d`, `v`, `u`, `n`, and `path` remain unchanged except for `path`, which now includes the value of `v` twice because it was appended to itself before the removal.
