### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Jayden starts with an empty array \( a \).
- He performs \( n \) operations in order, where each operation is either:
  - Appending an integer \( x \) to the end of the array (type 1).
  - Appending \( x \) copies of the current array to the end (type 2).
- After performing all operations, Jayden makes \( q \) queries to find the \( k \)-th element of the array.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Initializes an empty array `array`.
   - Iterates through each operation:
     - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array.
     - If the operation type is 2, it extends the array by repeating its current elements \( x \) times.
   - For each query, it appends the \( (k-1) \)-th element of the array (considering the array is zero-indexed) to the result list.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( q \), the operations, and the queries.
   - Calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the results.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_2` processes a series of operations and queries, calling `func_1` to handle the operations and returning the results of the queries.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The key issue in the original assessment is that the `func_1` function does not correctly simulate the appending of \( x \) copies of the array when `b=2`. Instead, it only extends the array with a repeated pattern of its current elements.
- However, upon closer inspection, the provided code actually correctly simulates the appending of \( x \) copies of the array. Here's why:
  - When `b=2`, the array is extended by repeating its current elements \( x \) times, which is exactly what the problem requires.
  - The modulo operation in the query handling part ensures that the index wraps around correctly, even if the array size exceeds the query index.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summaries provided.
