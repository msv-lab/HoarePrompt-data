Output State: **`maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `c` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the current value of `maxi`. The values of `c`, `i`, and `t` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `c` retains its value from the previous iteration, `i` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `maxi` is updated to reflect the new maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`.
