Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `lft` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n`, `rgt` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `rdb`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the values of all the variables as they were in the initial state, except for `rdb`, which is now an empty list.
