Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the third input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list `a` by splitting a string input by the user (which is expected to contain space-separated integers) into individual elements, converting each element to an integer, and storing them in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
