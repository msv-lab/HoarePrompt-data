Postcondition: `a` is the second integer from the last string input by the user, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`, `s` is the last string input by the user, `i` is the total number of iterations (k + n), where `n` is the number of iterations minus 2, and the sum `(a + b)` is even if the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is met, otherwise `b` is not updated to the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`.
