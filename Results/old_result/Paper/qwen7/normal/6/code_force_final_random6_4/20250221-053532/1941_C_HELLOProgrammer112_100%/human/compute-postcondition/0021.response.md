Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t-2 \leq 10^4\), `a` is the last input integer, `s` is the last input string from the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, and `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`. The loop has processed all test cases, and the final values of `x`, `y`, and `z` correspond to the last input string `s`.
