Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `dp` is an empty list

4. **Update the value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `3 + 1 = 4`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Given that `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Therefore, `i` should be set to 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 4, `dp` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
