Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( n \), a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers, and an integer \( t \) such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 \). For each test case, it prints an integer \( i \) that meets specific conditions related to the count of occurrences of each element in the list \( a \). If no such \( i \) exists, it prints nothing. The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly.**
