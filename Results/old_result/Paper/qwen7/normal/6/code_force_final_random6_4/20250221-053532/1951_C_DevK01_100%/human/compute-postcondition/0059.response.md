To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the formula for `cost`.

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `t` is a value such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
   - `L` is a list of integers.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers from the same input as `L`.
   - `n` is the length of the sublist `N`.
   - `m` is updated to the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, where `k` is the third element of `L`.
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
   - `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - `cost` is calculated based on certain conditions involving `n`, `m`, `k`, and `mu`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation depends on whether `n * m == k` or not.
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `cost` is incremented by the additional term `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.

Given the complexity of the problem, the exact value of `cost` cannot be determined without specific values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `mu`. However, the structure of the `cost` calculation is clear.

Therefore, the output will be a string that describes the calculation of `cost` based on the given conditions.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions: if n * m == k, then cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2); otherwise, cost is incremented by m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu, where mu = k - (n - 1) * m)**
