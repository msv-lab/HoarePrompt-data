You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The final value of `t` after the loop executes all its iterations is determined by the cumulative effect of the operations performed within each iteration. Specifically, for each iteration, the value of `t` is updated based on the conditions provided. After all iterations, `t` will be the sum of the adjustments made during each iteration, starting from the initial value of `t` (which is `b * 2`), and modified by the logic inside the loop. Each iteration updates `t` based on the inputs `a` and `b` provided by the user, and the final value of `t` will reflect the total accumulated changes across all iterations.
    #
    #The exact final value of `t` cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific values of `a` and `b` for each iteration, but it will be the result of repeatedly applying the logic described in the loop, starting from `t = b * 2` and adjusting `t` based on the conditions given.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens Needed:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized as `b * 2`. This represents the total number of 2x2 icons in terms of 1x1 cells.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t` is divided by 5. Otherwise, `t` is divided by 5 and incremented by 1. This calculation seems to be related to fitting the 2x2 icons into the grid.
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This seems to be an attempt to calculate the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, which represents the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed.
   - Depending on whether `t2 % 15` is zero, `t` is adjusted accordingly. If not, `t` is incremented by 1 to account for any additional screen needed.

### Correctness Check

1. **Handling of 2x2 Icons:**
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is flawed. Specifically, dividing `t` by 5 and adjusting based on the remainder does not correctly account for the layout constraints of the grid.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 5x3 grid has 15 cells per screen. Therefore, the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons should be calculated based on how many 4-cell blocks fit into 15 cells.

2. **Handling of 1x1 Icons:**
   - The logic for placing 1x1 icons into the remaining space is also problematic. The calculation `t1 >= a` and subsequent adjustments do not correctly account for the placement of 1x1 icons into the remaining space.

### Example Test Cases

Let's manually check the example test cases to see if the program produces the correct results:

- **Test Case 1:** `1 1`
  - 1 screen is enough since we can place 1 2x2 icon and 1 1x1 icon.
  - Expected: 1

- **Test Case 2:** `7 2`
  - 2 screens are needed: 1 for 2 2x2 icons and 1 for 7 1x1 icons.
  - Expected: 1

- **Test Case 3:** `12 4`
  - 2 screens are needed: 2 for 4 2x2 icons and 1 for 4 1x1 icons.
  - Expected: 2

- **Test Case 4:** `0 3`
  - 1 screen is enough since we can place 3 1x1 icons.
  - Expected: 1

- **Test Case 5:** `1 0`
  - 1 screen is enough since we can place 1 1x1 icon.
  - Expected: 1

- **Test Case 6:** `8 1`
  - 1 screen is enough since we can place 1 2x2 icon and 8 1x1 icons.
  - Expected: 1

- **Test Case 7:** `0 0`
  - No icons, so 0 screens are needed.
  - Expected: 0

- **Test Case 8:** `2 0`
  - 1 screen is enough since we can place 2 1x1 icons.
  - Expected: 1

- **Test Case 9:** `15 0`
  - 1 screen is enough since we can place 15 1x1 icons.
  - Expected: 1

- **Test Case 10:** `8 2`
  - 2 screens are needed: 1 for 2 2x2 icons and 1 for 8 1x1 icons.
  - Expected: 2

- **Test Case 11:** `0 9`
  - 1 screen is enough since we can place 9 1x1 icons.
  - Expected: 1

### Conclusion

Given the analysis and manual checks, the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. The logic for handling both 2x2 and 1x1 icons is flawed.
