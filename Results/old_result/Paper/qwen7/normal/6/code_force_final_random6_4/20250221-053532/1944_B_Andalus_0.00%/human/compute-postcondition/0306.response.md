Output State: `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the last element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the length of `sng`, and `rdb` is an empty iterable because there are no elements left to process after the loop has completed.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `sz` will be equal to the length of `sng` because the loop increments `sz` by 1 in each iteration until `sz` is no longer less than `k` or `k - sz` is less than 2. The loop stops once `sz` reaches the length of `sng`. At this point, `elem` will be the last element of `sng` because the loop processes each element sequentially. Since the loop breaks when `sz` is no longer less than `k` or `k - sz` is less than 2, `rdb` will be an empty iterable as all elements have been processed.
