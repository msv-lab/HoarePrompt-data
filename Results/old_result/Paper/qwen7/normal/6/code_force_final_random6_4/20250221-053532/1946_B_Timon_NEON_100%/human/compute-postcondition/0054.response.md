Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains either `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` and `new_segment` is not empty, or `new_segment + [i - 1]` with `max_segment` equal to `new_segment` if the condition `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` is false and `new_segment` is not empty; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.**

This means that the value of `max_segment[0]` has been updated by adding `arr[i]` to its current value. The conditions for `segments_variants` remain unchanged, and `new_segment` remains an empty list.
