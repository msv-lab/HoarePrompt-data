Output State: `segments_variants` is now an empty list, `segment` does not exist because there are no more elements in `segments_variants`, `new_segment` remains an empty list, `max_segment` remains unchanged as it holds the segment with the highest sum found so far during the loop's execution, `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` also remains unchanged and still holds the segment with the highest sum found so far.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `segments_variants` has been exhausted, meaning no further variants are available to process. Consequently, `segment` cannot be assigned any value since there are no elements left in `segments_variants`. The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `total_max_segment`) retain their last known values, with `max_segment` and `total_max_segment` holding the best segment found throughout the loop's execution.
