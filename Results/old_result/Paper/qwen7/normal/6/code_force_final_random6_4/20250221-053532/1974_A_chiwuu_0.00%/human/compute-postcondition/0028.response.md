Postcondition: `t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t1` remains unchanged and `t` is updated according to the specified rules. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t1` is set to `a - t1`, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t` is updated based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15 or not.
