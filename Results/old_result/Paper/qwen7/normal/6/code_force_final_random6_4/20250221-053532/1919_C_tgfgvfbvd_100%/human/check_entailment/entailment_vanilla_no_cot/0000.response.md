Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program attempts to minimize the penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences, but it does not correctly calculate the penalties for these subsequences. Instead, it seems to be trying to find a way to split the array such that the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences is minimized, which is not the same as calculating the penalties \(p(s)\) and \(p(t)\) directly.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to count the number of inversions in the array and then use a strategy to split the array into two subsequences to minimize the total number of increasing pairs in both subsequences. The given solution does not achieve this goal.
