Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the functions `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
3. `func_1` processes the operations to build the array and then uses the queries to determine the k-th elements.
4. The logic for building the array in `func_1` is correct:
   - For operation type 1, it simply appends the value to the array.
   - For operation type 2, it extends the array by repeating the existing array `x` times.
5. The logic for handling queries in `func_1` is also correct:
   - It uses modular arithmetic to handle large indices efficiently, ensuring that the index is within the bounds of the current array length.
6. The overall structure and logic of both functions match the problem description and the example provided.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
