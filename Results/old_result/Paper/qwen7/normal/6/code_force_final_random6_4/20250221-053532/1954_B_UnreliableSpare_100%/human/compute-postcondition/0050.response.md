Based on the initial state described:

- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
- `flag` remains `False`.
- `val` is the initial value of `arr[0]`.
- `cnt` remains `0`.

When the print statement `print(ans)` is executed, the value of `ans` will be printed. Since `cnt` is initially `0`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, if `ans` was greater than `0` before this update, it will now be `0`. If `ans` was `0` or negative, it will remain unchanged.

Given that `cnt` is `0`, the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` will always be `0` if `ans` was not already `0` or negative.

Therefore, the value of `ans` when the print statement is executed will be `0`.

Output: **0**
