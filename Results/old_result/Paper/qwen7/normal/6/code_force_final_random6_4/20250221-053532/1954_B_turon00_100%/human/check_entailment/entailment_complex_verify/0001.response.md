### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to 0. `ans` is set to `n` initially.
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`. When a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with `cnt`.
   - If `n == 1` or `ans == n`, it prints `-1` (indicating the array cannot be made non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

3. **Checking Correctness**:
   - The logic for counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` seems correct. This approach correctly identifies segments of the array where elements are the same.
   - However, the solution does not fully address the requirement to ensure the array stops being beautiful. Specifically, it does not account for the condition where removing elements can break the beauty property.
   - The solution only counts consecutive elements and does not consider the possibility of breaking the beauty property by removing elements strategically.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the second test case, the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` is identified as having a segment of length 2 (`cnt = 2`). However, this does not guarantee that removing 1 element will break the beauty property. Removing the middle `2` would indeed break the beauty property.
   - In the fourth test case, the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` is identified as having a segment of length 3 (`cnt = 3`). Again, this does not guarantee that removing 3 elements will break the beauty property. Removing the first three `3`s would indeed break the beauty property.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only counts consecutive elements without considering the strategic removal of elements to break the beauty property.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the process of iterating through the array and counting consecutive elements. However, it does not mention the need to consider strategic removals to break the beauty property.
   - The final state analysis confirms that the code processes all test cases correctly, but it does not validate the correctness of the logic for identifying the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
