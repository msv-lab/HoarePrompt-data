Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all vertices `u` that are descendants of `v` in the tree, plus the number of these descendants whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the sum of `remaining_size` of all such descendants.

In simpler terms, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will count how many of `v`'s descendants meet the criteria of having `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the total `remaining_size` of all these descendants.
