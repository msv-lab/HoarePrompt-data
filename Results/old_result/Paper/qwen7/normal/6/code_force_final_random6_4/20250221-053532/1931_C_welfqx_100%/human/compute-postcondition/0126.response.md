Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n - 1`, and `cn` will be the count of consecutive identical elements starting from index 0 up to `n-2`. The loop will exit if any pair of consecutive elements in `num` are not identical.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has checked each element in `num` against its successor. The variable `cn` will hold the count of how many times consecutive identical elements were found in the list `num` from the start up to the second last element. If at any point the condition `num[i] != num[i + 1]` is met, the loop breaks early, and `cn` will not be incremented further for the remaining elements.
