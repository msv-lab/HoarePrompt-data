Output State: **`price_increase` is 0, `total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is unchanged, `price` is increased by `price_increase`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `day` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the `total_cost` by adding the product of `price` and `tickets_to_buy`. The other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `price_increase` remains 0, `tickets_bought` remains less than `k`, `price` is increased by `price_increase` (which is 0), and `tickets_to_buy` remains the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.
