Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is correctly implemented using a loop that iterates `test` times.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\) which represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. This is done correctly using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Determining the Winner**: The key logic in the program is to check whether the sum of \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd. According to the problem, if \(a + b\) is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. The program correctly uses the bitwise AND operation (`&`) with 1 to check if the sum is even or odd. Specifically, if \(a + b \mod 2 == 0\), it means the sum is even, and thus Bob wins. Otherwise, Alice wins.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case immediately after determining the winner, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given that the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the correct output based on the provided examples, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
