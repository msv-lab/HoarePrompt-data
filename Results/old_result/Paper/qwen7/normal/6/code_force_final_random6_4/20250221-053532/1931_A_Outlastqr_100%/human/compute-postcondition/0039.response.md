Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `word` is either "zz" or 'aay' or 'aaa', and `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer.**

In this case, the code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `t`, `word`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
