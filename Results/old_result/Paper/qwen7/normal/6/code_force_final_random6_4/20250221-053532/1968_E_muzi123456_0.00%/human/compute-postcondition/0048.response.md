Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each test case, the function determines and returns a result based on the values of t and n.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers: `t` and `n`. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one based on the given constraints for `t` and `n`.
