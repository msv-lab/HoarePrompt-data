Based on the initial state provided, `res` must contain at least one element. However, no specific value or type of `res` is given, so we cannot determine the exact value of `i` since it is not defined in the initial state.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `i` which is not specified.

Output: **i (where i is an undefined variable)**
