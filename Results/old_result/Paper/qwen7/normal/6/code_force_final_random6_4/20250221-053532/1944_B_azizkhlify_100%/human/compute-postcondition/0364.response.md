Output State: The loop will continue to print each element in `res` until `res` is empty or the loop is manually stopped. Since the problem does not specify the termination condition beyond the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will keep printing elements from `res` as long as `res` contains elements.

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will consist of each element in the list `res`, printed one after another on the same line with a space between each element, until `res` becomes empty.
