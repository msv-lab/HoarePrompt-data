Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if there exists a template such that two strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not. A template is a string where lowercase letters in the template must match the corresponding letters in `a` and `b`, while uppercase letters in the template must not match the corresponding lowercase letters in `c`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function checks if there exists an index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - **func_2**: This function processes multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_1** correctly implements the logic to check if there is a template that satisfies the conditions for `a` and `b` but not for `c`.
   - **func_2** correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as required.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic in both functions appears to be correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
