Output State: `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the final values of `i` and `j` will be such that `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2. This is because the loop continues to increment `i` and decrement `j` as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j` and `arr[i]` equals `arr[j]`. Once these conditions are no longer met, the loop breaks. Given the conditions described for the first three iterations, it is clear that the loop will continue to execute until `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, at which point the conditions for the loop no longer hold true.
