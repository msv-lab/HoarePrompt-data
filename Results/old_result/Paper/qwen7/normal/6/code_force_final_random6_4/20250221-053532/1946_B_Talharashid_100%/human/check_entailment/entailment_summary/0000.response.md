Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The solution should consider the sum of the array and the effect of the operations on this sum.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key insight is that the maximum sum can often be achieved by repeatedly adding the largest possible positive sums from the array.
   - The formula used in the code, `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`, seems to aim at maximizing the sum by leveraging the power of 2 for the number of operations (`k`).

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates through each element of the array and calculates a cumulative sum (`c`) while keeping track of the maximum value (`maxi`) of `c`.
   - It then applies the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - This formula essentially maximizes the contribution of the largest positive sums in the array by multiplying them by `2^k`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The logic in the code aligns with the problem's requirements. It correctly identifies the maximum sum that can be achieved by considering the largest positive contributions and applying the power of 2 for the number of operations.
   - The use of modulo `1000000007` ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles negative numbers and zero appropriately by resetting the cumulative sum (`c`) when encountering a negative number whose absolute value is less than the current cumulative sum (`c`).
   - It also correctly sums the array and applies the formula for each test case.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
