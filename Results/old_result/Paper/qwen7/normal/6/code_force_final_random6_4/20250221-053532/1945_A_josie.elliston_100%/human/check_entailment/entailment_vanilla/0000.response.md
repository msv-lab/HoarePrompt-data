### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants based on their preferences.
   - Each tent can hold up to 3 people.
   - Introverts need a tent alone, Extroverts need a tent with 2 others, and Universals can share a tent with anyone.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as input.
   - It checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0`. If true, it further checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`.
     - If this condition is true, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate these participants.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as input.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` (indicating impossibility).
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the constraints for extroverts and universals.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly uses the result from `func_1` and adds the introverts' requirements.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where it's impossible to accommodate the participants (e.g., when `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`).

### Conclusion:
The provided functions correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required based on the given constraints. There are no logical errors in the provided code.

### Correctness:
**True**
