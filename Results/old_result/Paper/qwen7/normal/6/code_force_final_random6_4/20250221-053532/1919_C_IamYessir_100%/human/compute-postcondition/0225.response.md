Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element where the last element is now `a[-1]` (which was previously `x` and `y`), and `x` is equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `a[i]` (which is `a[0]` since `i` is 0) to the list `a`. This does not change the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, or `y`. The last element of the list `a` is now updated to the value of `a[0]`, which is the same as `x` and `y` before the append operation.
