Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list called `values` with a length equal to the maximum value in the `numbers` list plus one, and all elements are set to 0. The variables `t`, `n`, and `numbers` remain unchanged from their initial state.
