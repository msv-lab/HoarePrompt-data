Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user and its current value is 0.
- `m` is the second integer entered by the user and its current value satisfies \(m \% 2 \neq 0\) (i.e., `m` is an odd number).
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and its current value is not a power of 2.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(1)
```

This code simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
