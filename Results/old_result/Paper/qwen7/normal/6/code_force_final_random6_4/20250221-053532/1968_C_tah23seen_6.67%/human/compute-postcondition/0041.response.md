Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans[length_of_arr - 1]`, which is `ans[length_of_arr - 2] + arr[length_of_arr - 1]`**

This means the program returns the last element of the `ans` array, which is calculated as the sum of the second last element of `ans` and the last element of the `arr` array.
