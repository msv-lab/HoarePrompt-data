Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and reassembling them.
- The provided solution checks if \(b\) is even. If \(b\) is even, it returns 'yes', indicating that Bob can form a different rectangle. If \(b\) is odd, it returns 'no'.
- Let's analyze the logic:
  - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle along the width (or height if \(a\) is considered the width), resulting in two rectangles of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\). These two smaller rectangles can then be reassembled to form a new rectangle of dimensions \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\), which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.
  - If \(b\) is odd, the only way to cut the rectangle is into two \(a \times 1\) rectangles, and these cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle without rotating, which is not allowed as per the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
