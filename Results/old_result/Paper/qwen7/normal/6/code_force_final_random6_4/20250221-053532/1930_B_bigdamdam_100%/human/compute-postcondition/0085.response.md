Output State: `ind` is `2*n - 1`, `i` is `n`, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n-1`) is equal to `2*n - 1 - 2*j`, and `p[n]` is equal to `2*n - 1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ind` will be `2*n - 1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `p` will be filled from index `0` to `n-1` with values starting from `2*n - 1` and decreasing by `2` for each subsequent index, down to `2*n - 1 - 2*n`. Additionally, the value at index `n` in the list `p` will be `2*n - 1`.
