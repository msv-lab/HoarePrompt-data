Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number; `b` is an integer equal to the second input number; `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` both contain a list of integers representing all the nodes connected to `a` and `b` respectively through the edges defined by the inputs during each iteration of the loop; `x` must be greater than 2×10^5 since the loop runs `x-1` times and `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `a` will still hold the value of the first input number, and `b` will hold the value of the second input number. The `lst` dictionary will have keys corresponding to each node (as per the first input numbers), and the values will be lists of all nodes that are directly connected to the key node via the edges defined by the inputs during each iteration. The variable `x` will be greater than 2×10^5 because the loop runs `x-1` times, and `x` starts as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
