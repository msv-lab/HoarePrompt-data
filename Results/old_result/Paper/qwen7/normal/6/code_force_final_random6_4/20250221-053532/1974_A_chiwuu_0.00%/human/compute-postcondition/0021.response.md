Output State: **`t` is `t + t2 // 15`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`, and the current value of `t2` is divisible by 15.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The condition that `t2` is divisible by 15 is preserved.
