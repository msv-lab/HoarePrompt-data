Output State: **`i` is less than `m` and `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `1000000007`, `M` is 1000000007, `s` is 0, `a` is increased by `f + u + v + f`, `u` is the second integer from the split input, `v` is the third integer from the split input, `f` is the first integer from the split input.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers `u`, `v`, and `f`. These values are then added together and added to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
