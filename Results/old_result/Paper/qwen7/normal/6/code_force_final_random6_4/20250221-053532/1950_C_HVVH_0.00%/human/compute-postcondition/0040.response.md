Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop variable) and the loop runs `n` times. The relevant variables in the loop head are `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 1.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\)
   - `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'
   - `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, the value of `day` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs `n` times and we are at the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be decremented by 1.
   - The values of `t`, `day`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\)
- `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'
- `n` must be greater than 0 (since it was greater than 1 before and we just decremented it by 1)
- `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'
- `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':', `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'**
