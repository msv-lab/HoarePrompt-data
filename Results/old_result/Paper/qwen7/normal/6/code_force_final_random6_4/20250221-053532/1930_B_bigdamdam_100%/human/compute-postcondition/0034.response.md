Output State: **`ind` is decreased by 2**.

In the initial state, `ind` is assigned the value of `i`, and `n` is the first integer from the input. The code `ind -= 2` decreases the value of `ind` by 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, the updated state is that `ind` is decreased by 2, while `n` retains its original value as the first integer from the input.
