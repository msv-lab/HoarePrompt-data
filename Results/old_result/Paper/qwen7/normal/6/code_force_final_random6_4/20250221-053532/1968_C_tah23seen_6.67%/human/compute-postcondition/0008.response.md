Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`.
   - `ans[2]` is less than `arr[2]`.
   - `ans[2]` is now `ans[1] + ans[0]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[2]`) must be less than or equal to `arr[2]`.

4. **Check the Current State**:
   - From the current state, we know `ans[2]` is less than `arr[2]`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `ans[2]` is already less than `arr[2]`, the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` is satisfied.
   - However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `ans[2]` remains less than or equal to `arr[2]`.

6. **Final State**:
   - We need to ensure `ans[2]` is still less than or equal to `arr[2]` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 1, `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`, `ans[2]` is less than or equal to `arr[2]`**
