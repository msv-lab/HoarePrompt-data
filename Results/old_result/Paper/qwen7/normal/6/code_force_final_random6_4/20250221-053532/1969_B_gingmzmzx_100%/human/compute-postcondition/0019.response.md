Output State: **`ans` is 1, `zeroes` is 2, `cnt` is [2, 1], `s` has lost its first element, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- Initially, `ans` is 1 if the first element of `s` was 0, otherwise it is updated to `0 + (zeroes - cnt[0])`. Since the first element of `s` was 0, `ans` is 1.
- `cnt` is [2, 1] if the first element of `s` was 0, which matches our initial condition.
- `zeroes` is incremented by 1 if the first element of `s` was 0, so `zeroes` is now 2.
- `s` loses its first element.
- The code `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` updates `ans` to `1 + (2 - 2)`, which results in `ans` remaining 1.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.
