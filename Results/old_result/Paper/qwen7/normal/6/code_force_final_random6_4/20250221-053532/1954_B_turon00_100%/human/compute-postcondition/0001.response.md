State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the variables and objects in the loop head:
   - The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, which is typically used when the value of the iterator is not needed.
   - The loop uses `t` as the range parameter.

2. Determine the conditions under which the loop can execute:
   - The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times if `t` is a positive integer.
   - If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.
   - If `t` is a negative number or not within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the loop will not execute.

3. Adjust the state based on the conditions:
   - Since `t` must be a positive integer within the given range for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.
