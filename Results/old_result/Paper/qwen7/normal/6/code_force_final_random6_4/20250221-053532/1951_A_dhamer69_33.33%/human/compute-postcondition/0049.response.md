Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1's in the new input string `s`.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values of `start`, `end`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` stay the same as the initial state.
