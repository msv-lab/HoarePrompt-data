Postcondition: **Output State: `T` is False, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is reduced to 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list using map and lambda, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is the value of `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the values in `a`, `ans` is the total count of zeros in the list `a` after all iterations, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**
