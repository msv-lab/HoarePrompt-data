You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^3) and an integer \( n \) (3 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 10^5). For each test case, it generates a list of integers from 1 to \( n \), reverses the order of every second element in the list, and prints the modified list. The function does not return any value but prints the processed list for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program generates a permutation by reversing the even-indexed elements of the sequence from 1 to n. However, this approach does not guarantee that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) (with \(1 \leq i, j < n\) and \(i \neq j\)) will satisfy the condition that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

For example, consider \(n = 6\). The generated permutation would be \([4, 1, 2, 3, 6, 5]\). Here, \(p_1 = 4\) divides \(p_3 = 2\) and \(p_2 = 1\) divides \(p_4 = 3\), which violates the condition.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
