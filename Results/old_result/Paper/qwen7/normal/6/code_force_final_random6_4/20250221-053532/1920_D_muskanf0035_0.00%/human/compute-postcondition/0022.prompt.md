You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of operations, q is an integer representing the number of queries, operations is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x indicating the type of operation (1 or 2) and the value x, and queries is a list of integers k_i representing the positions of the elements Jayden wants to know.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer representing the number of operations for the last iteration, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries for the last iteration, `queries` is a list of integers representing the positions of the elements Jayden wants to know for the last iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for the last iteration.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` will still be greater than 0 (since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0), `n` and `q` will be the values corresponding to the last iteration of the loop, `queries` will be the list of integers representing the positions of the elements for the last query, and `result` will be the outcome of the `func_1` function applied to the parameters of the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`. It processes the operations and returns the results for the specified queries.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
