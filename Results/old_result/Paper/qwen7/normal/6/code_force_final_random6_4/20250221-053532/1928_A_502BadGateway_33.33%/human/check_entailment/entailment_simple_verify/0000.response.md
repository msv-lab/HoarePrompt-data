### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect and how the proposed correction addresses the issue.

#### Original Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` returns `'yes'` if `b % 2 == 0` (i.e., `b` is even).
   - It returns `'no'` otherwise.

2. **Problem Description**:
   - To form another rectangle, Bob must be able to cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then reassemble them into a new rectangle.
   - The key observation is that if either dimension (`a` or `b`) is greater than 1 and the other dimension is even, Bob can always form another rectangle.

3. **Examples Provided in the Original Assessment**:
   - **Test Case 1**: \(2 \times 6\)
     - Cutting into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and forming a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle is valid.
     - Current implementation returns `'no'` because \(6\) is even.
   - **Test Case 2**: \(2 \times 4\)
     - Cutting into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and forming a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle is valid.
     - Current implementation returns `'no'` because \(4\) is even.

4. **Corrected Function**:
   - The corrected function should return `'yes'` if either `a > 1` and `b % 2 == 0`, or `b > 1` and `a % 2 == 0`.
   - This ensures that if either dimension is greater than 1 and the other is even, the function returns `'yes'`.

#### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a > 1 and b % 2 == 0 or b > 1 and a % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not cover all necessary cases.
- The proposed corrected function accurately implements the logic required to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.

Given the analysis and the corrected function, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect according to the problem description and the provided examples.
