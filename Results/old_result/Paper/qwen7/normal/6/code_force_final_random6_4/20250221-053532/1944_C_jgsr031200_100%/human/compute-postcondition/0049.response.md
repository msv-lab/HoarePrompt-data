Functionality: The function accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list. It counts the frequency of each integer in the list and then iterates through these frequencies. If it finds two unique integers that appear only once, it prints the smaller one and breaks the loop. If no such pair exists, it prints the smallest integer that does not appear in the list. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result directly.
