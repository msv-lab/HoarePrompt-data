Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`
   - `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - Since the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`, `i` will be incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

5. **Final States at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is still greater than 0 (unchanged)
   - `x` is still either infinity or the last element of list `a` (unchanged)
   - `y` is still either infinity or the last element of list `b` (unchanged)

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`**
