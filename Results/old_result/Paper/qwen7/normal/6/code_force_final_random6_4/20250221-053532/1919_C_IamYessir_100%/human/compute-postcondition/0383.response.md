Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is an empty list implies `x` is infinity and `y` is infinity, otherwise `a` is not an empty list, `y` is the last element of list `a`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `a` now contains the element `lit[0]` appended to its previous contents.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` (which is `lit[0]` given the initial state) to the list `a`. Since `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the conditions regarding `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless `a` is not empty, the value of `y` remains as the last element of `a`, which is now `lit[0]`. The conditions on `x` and `y` also remain valid.
