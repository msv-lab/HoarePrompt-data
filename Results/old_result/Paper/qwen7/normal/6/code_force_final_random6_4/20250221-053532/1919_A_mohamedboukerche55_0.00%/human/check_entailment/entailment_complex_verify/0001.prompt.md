You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `a` is the second integer from the last string input by the user, `b` is the second integer from the last string input by the user converted to an integer, `s` is the last string input by the user, `i` is the total number of iterations (k + n), where `n` is the number of iterations minus 2, and `b` is updated to the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: 'bob  '
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: Postcondition: `a` is the second integer from the last string input by the user, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`, `s` is the last string input by the user, `i` is the total number of iterations (k + n), where `n` is the number of iterations minus 2, and the sum `(a + b)` is even if the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is met, otherwise `b` is not updated to the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple pairs of integers from user input, specifically taking the second integer from each pair, and then checks if the sum of these integers is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'bob  '; otherwise, it prints 'alice'. The function does not return any value but modifies the variables `a` and `b` based on the last input pair.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic**:
   - Each player alternates turns.
   - On each turn, a player can either swap wallets or keep them as is.
   - After swapping, a player removes one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If a player has more than one coin, they should always swap wallets because it allows them to remove a coin without losing the ability to swap again.
   - If a player has exactly one coin, they should not swap wallets to avoid losing immediately.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - The game essentially reduces to determining whether the total number of coins (a + b) is even or odd.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves, ensuring Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the second player into a losing position, ensuring Alice wins.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input string `s` and converts the split parts to integers `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` and prints 'bob' or 'alice' accordingly.

5. **Issue with the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - Specifically, the program incorrectly checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even and prints 'bob', but it should print 'alice' when the sum is odd.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it reverses the condition for determining the winner. The correct condition should be:
- If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, print 'alice'.
- Otherwise, print 'bob'.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('alice')
        else:
            print('bob')
```
