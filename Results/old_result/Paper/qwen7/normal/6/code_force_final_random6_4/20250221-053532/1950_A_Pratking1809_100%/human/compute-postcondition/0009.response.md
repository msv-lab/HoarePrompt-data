Given the initial state, we know the following:

1. `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers.
2. It is not true that `a < b < c`.
3. `b` is not greater than both `a` and `c`.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:

- Since it is not true that `a < b < c`, there are three possible scenarios:
  - `a >= b >= c`
  - `a <= b <= c`
  - `a < b > c` or `a > b < c`

- Additionally, since `b` is not greater than both `a` and `c`, `b` must be between `a` and `c` (inclusive) in one of the following ways:
  - `a <= b <= c`
  - `c <= b <= a`
  - `a >= b >= c`
  - `c >= b >= a`

Combining these two sets of conditions, the only scenario that fits both is `a <= b <= c` or `c <= b <= a`.

In either case, the print statement `print('NONE')` will simply print the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
