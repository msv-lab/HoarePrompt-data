Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not address the problem as described.

The main issues are:
1. The function does not handle the case where the array needs to be made uniform by selecting a segment and setting all elements within that segment to a common value.
2. The function incorrectly assumes that the minimum cost is determined by the distance between the first and last different elements, which is not always true.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
The correct output should be 4, as we can set the entire array to 1 in one operation, costing 6 burles, or set segments to the same value, but the given function does not compute this correctly.

Another example:
```
6
4 3 2 7 1 1
```
The correct output should be 6, as we can set the entire array to 1 in one operation, costing 6 burles. However, the provided function does not handle this scenario correctly.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
