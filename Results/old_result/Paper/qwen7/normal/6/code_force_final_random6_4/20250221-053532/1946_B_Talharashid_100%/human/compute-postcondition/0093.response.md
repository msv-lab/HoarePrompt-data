To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression in the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`.
   - `ele` is the last element of the list `l`.
   - `c` is the final accumulated value based on the conditions in the loop.

2. **Expression in the Print Statement**:
   \[
   (2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007
   \]

Given the initial state, we need to know the values of `maxi`, `c`, `l`, and `k` to evaluate the expression. However, since these values are not explicitly provided, we will express the output in terms of these variables.

- `maxi`: This is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.
- `c`: This is the final accumulated value from the loop.
- `l`: This is a list, and `ele` is the last element of this list.
- `k`: This is an integer that is part of the exponentiation operation.

The expression inside the `print` statement simplifies to:
\[
(2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007
\]

This means we are calculating:
1. \(2^k \times \text{maxi}\)
2. Subtracting \(\text{maxi}\) from the result of step 1.
3. Adding the sum of the list `l` to the result of step 2.
4. Taking the result modulo \(1000000007\).

Therefore, the output will be the result of the above expression.

Output: **(2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007**
