Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `bets` will be 0, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`, each element in `a` will be updated to `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices, and `sumo` will be the sum of all these updated elements in the list `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `sumo` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` will be a string containing the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces.**
