Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, and `pq` has been transformed into a min-heap; `total_cost` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `total_cost` to 0. This does not affect the state of the `pq` list or its heap property. Therefore, the `pq` list remains unchanged as a min-heap, and `total_cost` is set to 0.
