Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is less than 200 or exactly 200.**

Explanation: The code `s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)` assigns the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times to the variable `s`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the length of `s` is still less than 200 or exactly 200.
