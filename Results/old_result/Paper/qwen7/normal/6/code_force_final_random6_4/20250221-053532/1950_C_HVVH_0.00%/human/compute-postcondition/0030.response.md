Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':' and decreased by 12.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `day` to 'PM'. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `h`. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions for these variables as the initial state, except for `day`, which is now explicitly set to 'PM'.
