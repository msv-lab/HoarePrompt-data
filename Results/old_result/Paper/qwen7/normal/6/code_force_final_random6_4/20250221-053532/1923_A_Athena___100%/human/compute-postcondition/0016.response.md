Output State: **`res` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` attempts to remove and return the last element from the list `a`. However, since `a` is explicitly stated to be empty (`a must be empty`), calling `pop()` on an empty list will raise a `IndexError`. Given the constraints and the initial state, no elements are removed from `a`, and the state of `a` remains empty. The values of `res`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.
