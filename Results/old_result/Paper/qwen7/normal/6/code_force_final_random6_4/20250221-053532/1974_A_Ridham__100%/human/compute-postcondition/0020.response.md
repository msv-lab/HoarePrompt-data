Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2)` if `y` is even, or `15 * (y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `extra_space` as the difference between `space_x` and `remaining_cells`. Since `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` will be a positive value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
