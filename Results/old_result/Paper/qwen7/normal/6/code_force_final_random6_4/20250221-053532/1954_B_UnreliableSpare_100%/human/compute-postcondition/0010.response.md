Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`.
   - `flag` remains False.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `n > 1` must still hold true.
   - The condition `arr[i] != arr[i - 1]` must also hold true for `i = 2`.
   - The value of `flag` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `arr[2]` must not be equal to `arr[1]`.
   - `flag` remains False.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, and `flag` remains False.**
