Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a non-empty iterable.
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
- `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`, which is the next element in the iterable `sng`.

Output: **the next element in sng**
