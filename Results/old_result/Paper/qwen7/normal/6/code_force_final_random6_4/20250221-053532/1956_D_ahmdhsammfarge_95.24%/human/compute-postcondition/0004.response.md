Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`, `i` is 0, `sm` is sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - 0 + 1) ** 2**

Explanation: The code calculates `sm` using the formula `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. Given that `i` is 0, the first part of the sum is `sum(lst[:0])`, which is 0 because there are no elements in the slice. Similarly, `j` is not defined in the initial state, so it remains undefined. The third part of the sum is `(j - 0 + 1) ** 2`, which simplifies to `(j + 1) ** 2`. Since `j` is not specified, we keep it as `(j + 1) ** 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
