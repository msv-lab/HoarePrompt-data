Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6). The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. For each test case, the function returns information about the string `s` based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a value `t` and a string `s`. It then returns specific information related to the string `s` for each test case, without directly accepting any parameters in its definition.
