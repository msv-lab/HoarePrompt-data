You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, m is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, k is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and prices is a list of n positive integers representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

    #State: Output State: `price_increase` is increased by the total number of tickets bought, `total_cost` is the sum of the cost of all tickets bought, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, `price` is the last price plus the final `price_increase`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought` for the last iteration, `day` is the `day` value popped from the priority queue `pq` during the last iteration.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `price_increase` will have been incremented by the total number of tickets bought across all iterations. The `total_cost` will be the cumulative cost of all tickets purchased. `tickets_bought` will equal `k`, indicating that all available tickets have been bought. The `price` will reflect the final price after all increments. `tickets_to_buy` will be the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets needed to reach `k` for the last iteration, and `day` will be the `day` value corresponding to the last ticket bought.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the total cost of all tickets bought, which is the cumulative sum of the cost of each ticket purchased over all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of sale days), `m` (the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (the number of tickets to be bought), and `prices` (a list of ticket prices for each day). It calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the price increases based on the number of tickets bought each day.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves purchasing tickets over multiple days with increasing prices based on the number of tickets bought on any given day. The goal is to minimize the total cost of buying `k` tickets.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost of buying `k` tickets.
   - In `func_1`, a priority queue (min-heap) is used to always consider the cheapest available ticket price.
   - The algorithm iteratively buys tickets starting from the cheapest available price, updating the price increase and total cost accordingly.
   - The logic to calculate the number of tickets to buy each day (`min(m, k - tickets_bought)`) ensures that the maximum allowed tickets per day are bought unless fewer are needed to reach `k`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the algorithm always considers the lowest possible price for the next ticket purchase.
   - The logic for updating the price increase after each purchase is correctly implemented.
   - The overall structure of the algorithm matches the problem requirements and examples provided.

Given this analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.
