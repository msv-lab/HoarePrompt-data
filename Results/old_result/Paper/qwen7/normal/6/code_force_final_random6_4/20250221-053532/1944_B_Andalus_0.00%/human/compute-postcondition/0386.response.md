Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` and the iterable `sng`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `elem`: This variable will take on values from the iterable `sng` during each iteration.
   - `sng`: This is the iterable over which the loop will iterate.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `sng` to process.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - Since the loop will start processing elements from `sng`, `sng` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - `elem` will be assigned the value of the first element in `sng` during the first iteration.

5. **Consider the given pre-loop state**:
   - All elements in `ldb` have been processed.
   - `sz` is equal to `k` or more.
   - No further elements are printed.

6. **Combine the relevant information**:
   - The state of `ldb` and `sz` does not directly affect the execution of the loop over `sng`.
   - The key adjustment needed is ensuring that `sng` has at least one element to process.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `sng` to ensure it has at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sng` must have at least one element**
