Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in cur_arr`. The variables involved here are `i` and `cur_arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing the current array segment being processed.
   - `i` is the variable that will take on each value from `cur_arr` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element. If `cur_arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `cur_arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `cur_arr` is not empty.
   - The variable `i` will take on the values from `cur_arr`, but its specific value before the loop starts is not relevant to the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cur_arr` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0**
