Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it should be correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the prices and indices of the tickets for each day. This allows the algorithm to always consider the cheapest available ticket first.

2. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a heap to efficiently get the lowest price ticket each iteration. It ensures that the tickets are bought in such a way that the total cost is minimized.

3. **Price Increase Mechanism**: After buying tickets on a particular day, the program correctly updates the price increase for subsequent days based on the number of tickets bought on the current day. This is done by adding the number of tickets bought to the `price_increase` variable.

4. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program buys up to `m` tickets per day until the required `k` tickets are purchased. It ensures that the total cost is calculated correctly by multiplying the price (including any increases) by the number of tickets bought.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the number of tickets to be bought exceeds the number of available tickets in a single day by buying as many as possible without exceeding `k`.

Given the above points, the program should correctly compute the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
