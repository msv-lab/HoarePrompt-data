Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in res`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `res`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is given as 3.
   - `res` is given as containing `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[3]`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in res` to execute, `res` must be a non-empty iterable (list, tuple, etc.) because the loop iterates over each element in `res`.
   - Since `i` is given as 3, it is already set and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `res` is a non-empty iterable. Given that `res` contains `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[3]`, it is a non-empty iterable.
   - The value of `i` being 3 is already provided and does not need adjustment.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `res` is a non-empty iterable.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` is a non-empty iterable containing `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[3]`, `i` is 3**
