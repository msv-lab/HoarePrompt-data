Output State: `t` is 1, `i` is 2, and `N` is greater than 0.

Explanation: Based on the given information, after the loop has executed 3 times, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, and `N` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop has completed its full execution, there is no further change in the values of these variables. The value of `t` remains 1 because it was incremented once when `cnt[2]` was 1 (assuming `cnt[2]` was the last element checked before the loop condition was met). The value of `i` is 2 as it was incremented three times within the loop but did not reach a point where the loop would break due to `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`. Therefore, `N` remains greater than 0 as it was initially and has not been modified by the loop.
