Postcondition: **`C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` or `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. `C[out_aa]` is set to `D[out_aa]` if `C[in_aa]` equals `C[in_aa]` + 1. `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged if `D[in_aa]` is incremented. `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0. `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` equals `C[in_aa]` + 1, otherwise it is not decreased. `C[in_aa]` is always greater than 0. `aa[m:]` must have at least one element, and `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element.**
