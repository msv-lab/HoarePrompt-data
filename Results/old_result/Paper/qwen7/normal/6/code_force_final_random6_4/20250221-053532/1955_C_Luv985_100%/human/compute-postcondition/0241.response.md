Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which represents the number of sub-cases. For each sub-case, it takes two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and a list of n positive integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i represents the durability of the i-th ship. The function returns different outputs based on the values of n, k, and the list a for each sub-case.**

This functionality describes a function that iterates over multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and processes them according to the given conditions without accepting any external parameters directly.
