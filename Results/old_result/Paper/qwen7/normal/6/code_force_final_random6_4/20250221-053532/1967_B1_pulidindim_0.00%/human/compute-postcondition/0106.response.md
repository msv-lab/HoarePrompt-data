Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an integer such that `m` is at least the value that causes the loop to exit, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is equal to the sum of `n` plus the series \(\sum_{k=2}^{m+1} \left(\frac{n}{k} - (k-2)\right) + 1\), `countmins` is 0, `g` is now `n / (m + 1) - 0`.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop continues until `count` exceeds `m`. For each iteration, `ans` accumulates the value of `g / count + 1`, where `g` is adjusted based on the current `count`. After `m` iterations, `count` becomes `m + 1`, and `ans` contains the sum of the series described above.
