You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. It prints pairs of identical elements from the left half of the list and single occurrences from both halves up to a limit defined by k. After processing, it ensures all elements in the `sng` list have been printed and the `sz` variable equals the total number of elements in `sng`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to split the array `a` into two subsets `l` and `r`, each of length `2k`, such that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`. The array `a` consists of each integer from 1 to `n` exactly twice.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the array `lst` which is of length `2n`.
   - It splits `lst` into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, corresponding to the first `n` and last `n` elements of `lst`, respectively.
   - It initializes empty lists `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` to store elements with duplicates, unique elements from the left half, and unique elements from the right half, respectively.
   - It sorts `lft` and `rgt` to easily identify duplicates and unique elements.
   - It populates `ldb` with duplicate elements from `lft` and `sng` with unique elements from `lft`.
   - It populates `rdb` with duplicate elements from `rgt`.
   - It constructs `l` and `r` using elements from `ldb` and `sng` to ensure the XOR condition is met.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for constructing `l` and `r` ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` will match the XOR of elements in `r` because:
     - Duplicates in `ldb` are added in pairs, ensuring their XOR cancels out.
     - Unique elements in `sng` are added to both `l` and `r` in such a way that their XOR remains balanced.
   - The sorting step helps in easily identifying duplicates and unique elements, which is crucial for the construction of `l` and `r`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `k` is small enough to fit within the available unique and duplicate elements.
   - It ensures that the XOR condition is met by carefully selecting elements from `ldb` and `sng`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The code correctly implements the solution by ensuring that the XOR of elements in `l` matches the XOR of elements in `r`.
   - The logic is sound and should work for all valid inputs as per the problem constraints.
