Output State: **`i` is 3, `dif` is not 0, `res` is -1, `ans` is `ans` + `dif`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif`. Since `dif` is not 0, `ans` will be updated by adding the value of `dif` to its current value. The other variables (`i`, `dif`, and `res`) remain unchanged. The condition `k >= dif * (i + 1)` is not relevant to the direct impact on the variables `ans`, `i`, `dif`, and `res`.
