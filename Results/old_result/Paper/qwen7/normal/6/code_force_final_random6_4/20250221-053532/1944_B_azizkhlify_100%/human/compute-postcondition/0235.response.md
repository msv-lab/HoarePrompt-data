Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the fifth element from `res`.
- `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res` and 2 * `n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`.
- The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

From the information given, we know that `a[i]` is the value at the index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is the fifth element from `res`, and no specific value for `res` is provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]`. However, we do know that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, which implies that `a[i]` must be 3 because `r[a[i] - 1]` would be `r[2]` (since `a[i] - 1 = 2`).

Therefore, `a[i]` is 3.

Output: **3 3**
