Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least two elements; xor is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`.**

Explanation: The variable `xor` is updated by performing the XOR operation with each element `i` in the list `cur_arr`. Since the initial value of `xor` is not specified, it is assumed to start as 0 (the default value for XOR operations). After the code runs, `xor` will hold the result of XORing all elements in `cur_arr`. The list `cur_arr` remains unchanged.
