Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `n-2` to `-1` in reverse order.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.
   - The value of `y[i]` is determined by the condition `t[i] == 'R'`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs in reverse, the next value of `i` will be one less than the current value of `i`.
   - If `i` was `n - 2` in the previous iteration, it will now be `n - 3`.
   - If `i` was `n - 3` in the previous iteration, it will now be `n - 4`.

4. **Update the State:**
   - The new value of `i` will be `n - 3` or `n - 4` depending on the previous value.
   - The value of `y[i]` will be updated based on the condition `t[i] == 'R'` for the new value of `i`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`i` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4`; `y[i]` is `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i]` equals 'R', otherwise `y[i]` is `k * a[q1] % m`**.
