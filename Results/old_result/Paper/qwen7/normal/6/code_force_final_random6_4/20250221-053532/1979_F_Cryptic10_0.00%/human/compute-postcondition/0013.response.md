Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding `v`, `d` is n-1, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list with the last element being `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement. All the other variables remain in their previous states.
