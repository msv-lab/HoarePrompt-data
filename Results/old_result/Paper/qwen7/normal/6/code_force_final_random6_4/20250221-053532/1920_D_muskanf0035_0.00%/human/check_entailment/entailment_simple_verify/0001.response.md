### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `array = []`: Initializes an empty list.
   - `result = []`: Initializes an empty list to store results.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - The function iterates through each operation.
   - If the operation type (`op_type`) is 1, it appends the value to the `array`.
   - If the operation type is 2, it extends the `array` by repeating its current content `value` times.

3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, it calculates the index using modulo operation: `(k - 1) % len(array)`.
   - This ensures that the index wraps around the array, which is necessary when the array size exceeds the query index.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries respectively.
   - Reads the operations and stores them in a list.
   - Reads the queries and stores them in a list.

2. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - Calls `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
   - Prints the results.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly handles both types of operations:
  - Appending a single value (type 1).
  - Extending the array by repeating its current content (type 2).
- The query handling in `func_1` uses the modulo operation to handle large indices efficiently, ensuring that the index wraps around the array size.
- The `func_2` function correctly processes each test case and calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.

However, there is a critical issue with the implementation of extending the array by repeating its current content. Specifically, the line:
```python
array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
```
This line incorrectly repeats the entire array `value` times instead of repeating each element `value` times. The correct approach would be to repeat each element `value` times, but the current implementation simply repeats the entire array.

To fix this, we need to use:
```python
array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))] * value)
```

### Corrected Implementation:
Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))] * value)
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the current implementation of extending the array is incorrect. The corrected implementation should use the multiplication operator to repeat each element `value` times.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the mistake in the array extension logic.
