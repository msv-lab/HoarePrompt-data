Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to `mod_y`. The value of `num` is the first element of the list `arr`, and `mod_x` is defined as `-num % x`, which does not affect the value of `num` or `arr`. Therefore, `arr` remains a non-empty list with `num` as its first element, and `mod_y` is now the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
