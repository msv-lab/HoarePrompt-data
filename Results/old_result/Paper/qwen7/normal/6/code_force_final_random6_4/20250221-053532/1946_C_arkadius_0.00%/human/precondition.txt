t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. Each set also includes n-1 lines, where each line contains two integers v and u representing an edge between vertices v and u in the tree. The sum of all n values across all sets does not exceed 10^5.
