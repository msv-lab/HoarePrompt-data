To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head, which consists of the variables `i` and `j`.

Given the loop condition `i <= j`, the loop can continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, or `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i <= j` must still hold true. Let's analyze both cases:

1. **Case 1: `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1**
   - If `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, then `i <= j` is true because 0 is less than or equal to the length of `arr` - 1.
   - This case does not require any adjustment since the loop condition is already satisfied.

2. **Case 2: `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2**
   - If `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, then `i <= j` is also true because 1 is less than or equal to the length of `arr` - 2.
   - This case does not require any adjustment since the loop condition is already satisfied.

Since both cases already satisfy the loop condition `i <= j`, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, or `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2**
