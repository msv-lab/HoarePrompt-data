Output State: **`ans` is 3, `sm` is `k`, `r` is `previous_r + 1`, `m` must be less than or equal to `previous_r + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `previous_r + 1`, `ca[a[previous_r + 1]]` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `sm -= 1` decrements the value of `sm` by 1. Initially, `sm` was `k + 1`. After decrementing, `sm` becomes `k`. All other variables (`ans`, `r`, `m`, `n`, and `ca[a[previous_r + 1]]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
