Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is the second largest value among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`, and `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing three consecutive elements starting from index `i` to `i + 2`. After the if-else block executes, `max` is equal to `temp[1]`.
