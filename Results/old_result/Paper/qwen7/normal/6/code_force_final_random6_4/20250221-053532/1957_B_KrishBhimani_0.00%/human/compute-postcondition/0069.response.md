Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` must be non-zero and `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0 and 1, `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5. If `k` is odd, `k` is incremented by 1 and `arr` is updated to contain 1. If `k` is even, the values of `i`, `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k0`, `arr`, `ans`, and `c` remain unchanged.
