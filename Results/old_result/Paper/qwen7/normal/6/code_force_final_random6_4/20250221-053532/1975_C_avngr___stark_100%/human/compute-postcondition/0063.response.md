Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is the second largest value among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`, `max` is updated to the maximum second largest value found during the entire execution of the loop, `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing three consecutive elements, and `temp` is sorted after each iteration.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, while the other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
