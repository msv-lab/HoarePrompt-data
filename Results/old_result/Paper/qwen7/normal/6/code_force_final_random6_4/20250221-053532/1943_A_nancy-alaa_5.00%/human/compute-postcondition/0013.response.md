Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`
- `i` is `0`
- `n` is greater than `0`
- `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`
- The current value of `i` is such that `mpp[i]` equals `1` and `first` is `True`

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

Given that `first` is `True` and `mpp[i]` equals `1`, it implies that `i` is the first occurrence of an element in `arr` whose count is `1`. Since `i` is initially set to `0`, and no other conditions contradict this, `i` must still be `0` at the point of execution.

Output: **0**
