Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and the string `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, assigning each character to `i` in turn.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ac` and `bc` are integers.
   - `q` is `t`.
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is the first character of `s`.
   - If the first character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 0. Otherwise, `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character of `s`, `i` will be set to the next character in `s`.
   - `s` remains the same as it is the string being iterated over.
   - `ac` and `bc` remain unchanged because they are determined by the initial character of `s` and not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be the second character of `s`.
- `ac` and `bc` will retain their values from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ac` and `bc` are integers, `q` is `t`, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `s`. If the second character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 0. Otherwise, `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 1.**
