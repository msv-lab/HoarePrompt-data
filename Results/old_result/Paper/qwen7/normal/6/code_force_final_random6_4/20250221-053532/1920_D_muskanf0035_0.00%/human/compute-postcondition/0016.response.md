Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers formed by splitting and converting the input string using map function.**

Explanation: The code `queries = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list from these integers. The original values of `t` and `q` remain unchanged, and `n` is the number of elements in the input string before conversion to integers, which is now stored in the `queries` list.
