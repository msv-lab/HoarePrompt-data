Output State: `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the final value after the loop completes, `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated within the loop plus additional increments based on the specified conditions.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains 0 as it was not modified inside the loop. The variable `a` retains its initial value since it is not changed within the loop. The variable `b` will be set to the highest value of `i` used in the loop, which is `b + 1` where `b` is the original value passed into the loop. The variable `suma` accumulates the value of `x` for each iteration of the loop, adding 1 to `suma` if the specific condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is met for any `i`.
