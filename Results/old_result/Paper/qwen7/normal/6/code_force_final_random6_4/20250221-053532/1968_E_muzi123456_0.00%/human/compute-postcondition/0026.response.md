Output: **1** 

Explanation: The initial state defines that `t` is 1001, `i` is 1004, and `n` must be greater than 1003. These values do not affect the execution of the print statement `print('1', end=' ')`. The `end=' '` parameter in the print function is used to specify what character should be written at the end of the output, but it does not change the content being printed. Therefore, the statement will simply print the character '1'.
