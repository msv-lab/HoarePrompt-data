Based on the initial state and the given conditions, we know that:

- `sz` is an integer that is greater than or equal to `k`.
- If `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k - 2`, it is now exactly `k - 2`.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since no specific value is given for `elem`, we cannot determine its exact value from the provided information.

Given this, the output will be:

Output: **elem elem ** (where `elem` is the value of the variable `elem`)
