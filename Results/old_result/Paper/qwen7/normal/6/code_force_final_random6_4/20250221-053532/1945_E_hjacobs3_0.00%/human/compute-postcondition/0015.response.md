To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head conditions and the current values of the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `l <= r`.

2. **Current Values:**
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
   - If `array[mid] >= find`, then `l` is 0, `r` is `mid - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition:**
   For the loop to continue executing, the condition `l <= r` must hold true.

4. **Analyze the Current States:**
   - If `array[mid] >= find`, then `l = 0` and `r = mid - 1`. In this case, `l <= r` is true because `0 <= mid - 1` (assuming `mid > 0`).
   - If `array[mid] < find`, then `l = mid + 1` and `r = n - 1`. In this case, `l <= r` is true as long as `mid + 1 <= n - 1` or `mid < n - 1`.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to maintain the condition `l <= r`. This means:
   - If `array[mid] >= find`, `l` should remain 0 and `r` should remain `mid - 1`.
   - If `array[mid] < find`, `l` should be `mid + 1` and `r` should be `n - 1`.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   Since the loop condition `l <= r` must hold true for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `l` and `r` are set such that `l <= r` is satisfied.

### Conclusion:

Given the conditions, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `r` to ensure that `l <= r` holds true for the next iteration. The current values of `l` and `r` are already set based on the conditions provided, so no further adjustments are necessary.

### Final Answer:

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `mid - 1` if `array[mid] >= find`, otherwise `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is `n - 1`**.

This ensures that the loop condition `l <= r` is satisfied for the next iteration.
