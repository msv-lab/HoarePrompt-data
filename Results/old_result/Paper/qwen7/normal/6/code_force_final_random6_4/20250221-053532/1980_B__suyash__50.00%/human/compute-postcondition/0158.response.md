Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` by spaces and converting each part to an integer.
- `o` is a list of strings sorted in reverse order.
- `n` is the first element of list `b`.
- `f` is the second element of list `b`.
- `k` is the third element of list `b`.
- `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` of list `o`.
- `dic` is a dictionary where keys are elements of list `o` and values are their counts in list `o`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` without any dependence on the values of other variables or objects.

Output: **NO**
