### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants based on their preferences.
   - Each tent can hold up to 3 people.
   - Introverts need a tent alone, Extroverts need a tent with 2 others, and Universals can share a tent with anyone.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as input.
   - It checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0`. If true, it further checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`.
     - If this condition is true, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate these participants.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the constraints for extroverts and universals. However, there is a flaw in the condition check. Specifically, the condition `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` should be `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` but it should be checked more carefully. For example, if `extroverts % 3 == 1` and `universals == 1`, it should still be possible to form a group of 3, but the current condition would incorrectly return `None`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as input.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` (indicating impossibility).
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1`.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly uses the result from `func_1` and adds the introverts' requirements.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` has a flaw in the condition check. Specifically, it incorrectly returns `None` in some cases where it should not.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the results from `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where it's impossible to accommodate the participants (e.g., when `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`), but it fails in certain scenarios due to the flawed condition check in `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions have a logical error in `func_1` due to the flawed condition check. This error can lead to incorrect results in certain test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
