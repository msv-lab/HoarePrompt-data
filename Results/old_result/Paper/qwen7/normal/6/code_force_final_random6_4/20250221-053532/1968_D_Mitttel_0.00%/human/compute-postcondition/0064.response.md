Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(remainder_steps)`. The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `remainder_steps`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `remainder_steps` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `full_cycles` remains unchanged
   - `remaining_steps` remains unchanged
   - `remainder_steps` remains unchanged
   - `score` is increased by `a[current_pos - 1]`
   - `cycle_score` remains unchanged
   - `current_pos` is updated to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`

4. **Determine the adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop depends on `remainder_steps`, we need to ensure that `remainder_steps` is decremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - All other variables (`full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `score`, `cycle_score`, `current_pos`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Decrease `remainder_steps` by 1.
   - The other variables remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`full_cycles` remains unchanged, `remaining_steps` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is decreased by 1, `score` is increased by `a[current_pos - 1]`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `current_pos` is updated to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`**
