Output State: **`i` is 0, `c` is the previous value of `c` + 1, and `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `i` remains unchanged and `ans` does not get modified, the values of `i` and `ans` stay the same as they were in the initial state. The only change is that `c` is now one more than its previous value.
