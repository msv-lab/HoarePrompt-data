Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`, and the current value of `y` is greater than or equal to the current value of `x`, `b` is a list that includes the value of `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` is 0, `lit[i]` refers to the first element of the list `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
