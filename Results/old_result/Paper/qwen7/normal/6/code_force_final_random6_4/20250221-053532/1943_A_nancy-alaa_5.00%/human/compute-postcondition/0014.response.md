Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered within the given code snippet, the values of `first`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the program breaks out of the current loop or conditional block.
