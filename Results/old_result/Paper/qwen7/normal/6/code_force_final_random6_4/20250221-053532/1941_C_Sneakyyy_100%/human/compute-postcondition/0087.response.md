Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'.
   - `a` is a new string input by the user and its length must be greater than 5.
   - `i` is 4.
   - The substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3.

3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.

Given that `i` is currently 4, the loop will execute one more time if `len(a) - 2` is greater than 4. This means `len(a)` must be greater than 6.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ans` is 2 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `a` is a new string input by the user and its length must be greater than 5, `i` is 4, the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3, and `len(a)` must be greater than 6**
