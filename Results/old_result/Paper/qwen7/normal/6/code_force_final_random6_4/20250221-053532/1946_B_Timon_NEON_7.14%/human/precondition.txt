t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the array a has n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; the function mod(number) returns the remainder of a number modulo 10^9 + 7.
