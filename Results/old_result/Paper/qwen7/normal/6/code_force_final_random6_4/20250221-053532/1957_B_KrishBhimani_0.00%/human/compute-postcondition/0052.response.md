Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is 4, `k` is 1, `k0` is equal to 4, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4], `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5.**

Explanation: The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length matches `n`. Initially, `ans` is `[4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16]` and `n` is 4. The length of `ans` is 8, which is already equal to or greater than `n`. Therefore, no new zeros are appended to `ans`. The loop has completed its iterations, and `c` is incremented to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
