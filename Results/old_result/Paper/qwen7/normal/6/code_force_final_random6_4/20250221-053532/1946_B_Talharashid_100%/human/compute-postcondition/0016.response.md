Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `l`.
- The postcondition given tells us about the conditions under which the loop updates the variables `c` and `maxi`.

### Loop Head Variables
- The only variables involved in the loop head are `ele`, `c`, and `maxi`.

### Conditions to Consider
1. **If `ele` is less than 0**:
   - `c` is set to 0.
   - `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` (which is 0) and the previous value of `maxi`.

2. **Otherwise (`ele` is non-negative)**:
   - `c` is updated to `c + ele`.
   - `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`.

### Previous Iteration State
- We know from the postcondition that `l` must have at least one integer element.
- We also know the values of `c` and `maxi` after the previous iteration.

### Next Iteration State
- We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the next `ele`**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `l`, the next `ele` will be the next integer in the list `l`.

2. **Update `c` and `maxi` based on the conditions**:
   - If the next `ele` is less than 0, `c` becomes 0, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of 0 and the previous value of `maxi`.
   - If the next `ele` is non-negative, `c` is updated to `c + ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`.

### Example Calculation
Assume the following values after the previous iteration:
- `c = 5`
- `maxi = 7`
- `l` still has elements left to iterate over.

#### Case 1: `ele < 0`
- Suppose the next `ele` is `-3`.
- `c` becomes 0.
- `maxi` is updated to the maximum of 0 and 7, which remains 7.

#### Case 2: `ele >= 0`
- Suppose the next `ele` is `4`.
- `c` becomes `5 + 4 = 9`.
- `maxi` is updated to the maximum of 9 and 7, which becomes 9.

### Final State
- The next `ele` will be the next integer in `l`.
- `c` will be either 0 (if `ele` is negative) or `c + ele` (if `ele` is non-negative).
- `maxi` will be the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.

### Conclusion
State: **`l` must have at least one integer element, `ele` is the next integer in `l`, `c` is either 0 or `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**

To provide a specific example, if the next `ele` is `-3`:
State: **`l` must have at least one integer element, `ele` is -3, `c` is 0, and `maxi` is 7.**

If the next `ele` is `4`:
State: **`l` must have at least one integer element, `ele` is 4, `c` is 9, and `maxi` is 9.**

In general:
State: **`l` must have at least one integer element, `ele` is the next integer in `l`, `c` is either 0 or `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
