Based on the initial state provided, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, the value of `i` itself is not relevant to the print statement, which simply outputs the string 'PEAK'.

Since the print statement does not reference any of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`, and only outputs the fixed string 'PEAK', the output will be:

Output: **PEAK**
