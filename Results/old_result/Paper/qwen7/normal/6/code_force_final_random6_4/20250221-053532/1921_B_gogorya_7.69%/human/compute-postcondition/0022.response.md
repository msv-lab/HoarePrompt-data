Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `res` is increased by 1 if `s1[i+1] == '1'` and `s2[i+1] == '0'`, and the condition `s1[i+1] == '1' and s2[i+1] == '0'` is checked whether `hd` is greater than 0 or not. If `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is decreased by 1 and the loop or iteration continues as before; if not, the condition remains unchanged.**
