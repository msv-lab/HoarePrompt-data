Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), and `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). If `A` is even, then `A` remains unchanged and \(B * 2 \geq C\) still holds. Otherwise, `A` is replaced by \(A // 2\).**
