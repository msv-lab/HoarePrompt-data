Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = [], []
    cp = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        if len(a) == 0:
            x = float('inf')
        else:
            x = a[-1]
        if len(b) == 0:
            y = float('inf')
        else:
            y = b[-1]
        if x > y:
            if y >= lit[i]:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
        elif x == y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif x < y:
            if x >= lit[i]:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    print(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `len(b)`, and `s` is the total count of times `b[i]` was found to be greater than `b[i - 1]` over all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(b)`, `b` is a list with at least one element, and `s` is the count of elements in list `b` where each element is greater than its preceding element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` will be equal to `len(b)`, `b` must have at least one element, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` will be the total number of times the condition `b[i] > b[i - 1]` was true during the loop's execution, `x` will be the last element of list `a` (or infinity if `a` is empty), and `y` will be the last element of list `b` (or infinity if `b` is empty).

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have reached the length of list `b`, indicating that every index from 1 to `len(b)-1` has been checked. The variable `s` will hold the count of consecutive increasing elements in list `b`. The values of `x` and `y` will remain as defined initially, unaffected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
