Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.
   - `rows` remains unchanged.
   - `costs` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `len(costs) - (k - 1)` remains unchanged because it is based on the length of `costs`, which does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `len(costs)` remains unchanged.
   - `costs` remains unchanged.
   - `total_costs` remains unchanged.
   - `rows` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every k consecutive elements from costs, rows remains unchanged, costs remains unchanged, i is 1, and len(costs) must be greater than or equal to k - 1**.
