Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 3.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, `n - 1` must be greater than 3, meaning `n` must be greater than 4.

5. **New State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 4 (since `i` is 3 and needs to be less than `n - 1`).
   - `i` remains 3 because it is not modified within the loop body in the given information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 3**
