### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants based on their preferences.
   - Each tent can hold up to 3 people.
   - Introverts need a tent alone, Extroverts need a tent with 2 others, and Universals can share a tent with anyone.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as input.
   - It checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0`. If true, it further checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`.
     - If this condition is true, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate these participants.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the constraints for extroverts and universals. However, the check `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` is unnecessary because if `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means there is at least one extrovert who cannot find a pair, making it impossible to accommodate all extroverts and universals together. Therefore, the check can be simplified to just `extroverts % 3 != 0`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as input.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` (indicating impossibility).
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1`.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly uses the result from `func_1` and adds the introverts' requirements.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the constraints for extroverts and universals, but the check `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` is redundant and can be removed.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly uses the result from `func_1` and adds the introverts' requirements.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where it's impossible to accommodate the participants (e.g., when `extroverts % 3 != 0`).

### Conclusion:
The provided functions correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required based on the given constraints. The original assessment is accurate except for the unnecessary check in `func_1`.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
