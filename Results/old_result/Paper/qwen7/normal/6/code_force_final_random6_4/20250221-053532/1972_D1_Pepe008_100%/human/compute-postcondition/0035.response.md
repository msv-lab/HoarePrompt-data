Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is `int(info[0])`.
   - `b` is the final value after the loop completes.
   - `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated within the loop plus additional increments based on the specified conditions.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `b + 1`.
   - For each `i` in this range, the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is checked.
   - If the condition is met, `suma` is incremented by 1.

3. **Final Values:**
   - `t` remains 0 because it is not modified in the loop.
   - `a` retains its initial value `int(info[0])` because it is not modified in the loop.
   - `b` is the highest value of `i` used in the loop, so `b = b + 1`.
   - `suma` is the sum of all `x` values that meet the specified condition.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(suma - 2)`.

Given the above, let's determine what will be printed:

- `suma` is the sum of all `x` values that meet the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `b + 1`.
- The print statement subtracts 2 from `suma`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **suma - 2 (where suma is the sum of all x values that meet the condition for each i in the range from 1 to b + 1)**
