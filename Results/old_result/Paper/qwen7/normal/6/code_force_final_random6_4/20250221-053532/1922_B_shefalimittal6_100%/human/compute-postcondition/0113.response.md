Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `x` is an integer value from `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `x`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and now `x` holds the integer value from `data[idx]`.
