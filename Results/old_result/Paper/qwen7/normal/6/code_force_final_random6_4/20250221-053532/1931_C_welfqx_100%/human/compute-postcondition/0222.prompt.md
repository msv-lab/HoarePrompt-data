Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n - 1`. After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - 2` (since it starts from `n - 1` and increments with each iteration until it reaches `n - 2`). The variable `cn` will be incremented each time `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`. The final value of `cn` will depend on how many consecutive elements in `num` are equal. The variables `j`, `f`, `onum`, `ck`, and `symb1`, `symb2` will retain their initial values unless explicitly changed within the loop, which they are not in this case.

In summary, the output state after the loop executes all iterations will be:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements in `num`
- All other variables (`j`, `f`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(n - 1):
    if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
        ck += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 1. If `onum[0]` is equal to `onum[1]`, then `ck` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ii` remains 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `onum[2]` is equal to `onum[3]`, then `ck` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
