You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/6b5282a065196a0a0ca650a68a351af816de8549.png)
It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
This function aims to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row of the river such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the first support cost to 1.
   - For the next `d-1` positions, add 2 to the cost because the distance between the first support and these positions is 1, and we need to add an additional support at each position.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - Create a min-heap with the initial costs and their indices.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - For each subsequent position `i` from `d` to the end of the row:
     - Remove the smallest cost from the heap until the index is greater than `i - (d + 2)`. This ensures that the distance between the current position and the last support in the heap is at least `d`.
     - Calculate the new cost for the current position `i` and push it into the heap.
     - Push the updated cost back into the heap.

4. **Return the Last Cost**:
   - The last element in the row will be the minimum cost for the entire row.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function calculates the total minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - Read the depth values for each row.

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Row**:
   - Use `func_1` to compute the minimum cost for each row.

3. **Calculate Total Costs for Consecutive Rows**:
   - Compute the sum of costs for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Find Minimum Total Cost**:
   - Find the minimum sum among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Verification

1. **Heap Usage**:
   - The use of a min-heap is correct for maintaining the minimum cost within the required distance constraint.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The logic for updating costs and maintaining the heap is sound and correctly implements the constraints.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input parsing and output printing are handled correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the row length might be less than `d` or when `k` is 1.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly according to the problem statement. The logic for calculating the minimum cost of placing supports in each row and then finding the minimum cost for consecutive rows is sound.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
