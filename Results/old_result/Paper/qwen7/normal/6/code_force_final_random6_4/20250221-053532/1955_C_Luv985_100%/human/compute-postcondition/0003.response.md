Output State: **T is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 - 1**

Explanation: The initial state of T is a positive integer within the range [1, 10^4]. After executing `T -= 1`, T is decremented by 1. Since T was originally at least 1, it is now a positive integer within the range [0, 10^4 - 1]. All other information about T being a positive integer within the original range remains valid, but the upper bound is now 10^4 - 1.
