Output State: **`hd` is `a1 - a2 - 4` (or `a1 - a2 - 6` if `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0'), `n` is greater than 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + 2`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The line `hd -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `hd`. Given the initial state, `hd` was either `a1 - a2 - 3` or `a1 - a2 - 5` depending on the values of `s1[2]` and `s2[2]`. After executing the line, `hd` becomes `a1 - a2 - 4` or `a1 - a2 - 6` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
