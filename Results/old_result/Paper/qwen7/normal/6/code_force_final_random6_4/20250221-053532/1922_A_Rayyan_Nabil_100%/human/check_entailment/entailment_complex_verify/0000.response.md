### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not.
   - A template `t` consists of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters.
   - For lowercase letters in `t`, the corresponding characters in `a` or `b` must match.
   - For uppercase letters in `t`, the corresponding characters in `a` or `b` must differ from the lowercase version of the character in `t`.

2. **Current Implementation (`func_1`):**
   - The current implementation checks if for each position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - This does not satisfy the requirement that `a` and `b` must match the template while `c` does not.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     2
     aa
     bb
     ab
     ```
   - According to the problem description, a valid template could be `"AA"` or `"BB"`.
   - The current implementation would return `'NO'` because there is no position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.

4. **Corrected Implementation:**
   - The original assessment suggests a corrected version of `func_1`:
     ```python
     def func_1(n, a, b, c):
         for i in range(n):
             if (a[i] == c[i] and b[i] != c[i]) or (b[i] == c[i] and a[i] != c[i]):
                 return 'YES'
         return 'NO'
     ```
   - This corrected function checks if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `c[i]` while the other does not, ensuring that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

5. **Verification Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` iterates through each character and checks the conditions specified in the problem description.
   - `func_2` processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described, and the suggested correction is necessary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect based on the problem requirements.
