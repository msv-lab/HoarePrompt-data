The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer
- `f` is 0 (though `f` is not part of the loop head, it does not affect the loop condition)

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop can execute again as long as `n` remains a positive integer and `j` is incremented to 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be 1
- `n` must remain a positive integer

State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**
