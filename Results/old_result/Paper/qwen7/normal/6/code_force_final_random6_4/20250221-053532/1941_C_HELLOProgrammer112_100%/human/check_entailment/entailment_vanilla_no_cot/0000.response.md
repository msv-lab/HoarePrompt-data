Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The logic `x + y - z` is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping substrings and does not ensure the minimum deletions.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate through the string and check for occurrences of "pie" and "map". We should keep track of the minimum deletions required to avoid both substrings. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        i = 0
        deletions = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            if 'pie' in s[i:]:
                start = s[i:].find('pie')
                end = start + 3
                deletions += 3
                i += end
            elif 'map' in s[i:]:
                start = s[i:].find('map')
                end = start + 3
                deletions += 3
                i += end
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(deletions)

func()
```

This corrected program iterates through the string and finds the minimum deletions required to remove either "pie" or "map" substrings, ensuring the minimum number of deletions.
