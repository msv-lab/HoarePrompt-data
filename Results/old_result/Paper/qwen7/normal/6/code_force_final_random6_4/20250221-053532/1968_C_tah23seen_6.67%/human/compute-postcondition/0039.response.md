Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be -1, and `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` will be the final value of `ans` which is the maximum possible value that can be achieved by doubling the values according to the given conditions.**

To break this down in natural language:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have been decremented below 0, making it -1. The final element in the `ans` list, `ans[length_of_arr - 1]`, will hold the result of the process described in the loop. This result is obtained by starting with `ans[0]` initialized to `arr[0] + 1`, then iteratively updating subsequent elements of `ans` based on the values in `arr`. During these updates, each `ans[j]` (where `j` ranges from 1 to `length_of_arr - 1`) is doubled until it exceeds the corresponding `arr[j]`, ensuring that the final value of `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` reflects the cumulative effect of these operations across all elements of `arr`.
