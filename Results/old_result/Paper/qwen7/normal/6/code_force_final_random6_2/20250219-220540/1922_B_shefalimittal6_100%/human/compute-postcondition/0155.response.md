Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in the list `v` from index `0` to `2 * n`, `ans` is the sum of all increments based on the values of `v[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `2 * n`, and `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string representation of `ans` to the list `results`. Since `results` was not mentioned to have any initial elements, after appending, `results` will contain one element which is the string representation of `ans`. The values of `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their final values after the loop.
