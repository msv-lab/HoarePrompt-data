Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(cycle_length)`. The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `cycle_length`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `cycle_score` is increased by the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]`.
   - `cycle_pos` is updated to the value of `p[cycle_pos - 1]`.
   - `cycle_length` must be greater than 0.

3. **Check the Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute again, `cycle_length` must be greater than 0. Since `cycle_length` must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it means `cycle_length` is still greater than 0 for the current iteration.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `cycle_length` must remain greater than 0. No other states need adjustment since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, because the loop condition is still satisfied.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cycle_score` is increased by the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]`, `cycle_pos` is updated to the value of `p[cycle_pos - 1]`, `cycle_length` must be greater than 0**.
