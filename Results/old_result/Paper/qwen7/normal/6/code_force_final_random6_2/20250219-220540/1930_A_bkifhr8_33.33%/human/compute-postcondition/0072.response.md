Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `ans_f` contains the last calculated `ans`, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i` or `ans_f`. Therefore, the output state retains the value of `i` as `2 * n + 1` and keeps `ans_f` containing the last calculated `ans` value, while setting `ans` to 0.
