Output State: **`cur_arr` contains at least one element; `xor` is the XOR of `xor` and the first element of `cur_arr`.**

Explanation: The variable `xor` is updated by performing the XOR operation between its current value and the value of the first element `i` from `cur_arr`. Since `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `cur_arr`, and `xor` is now the XOR of its original value and `i`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
