Output State: **The set `a` now contains all unique characters from the string `s`, and the variables `i`, `t`, and `isreverse` remain unchanged; `isreverse` is the reversed version of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `isreverse = s[::-1]` reverses the string `s` and assigns the reversed string to the variable `isreverse`. The set `a`, variables `i`, `t`, and the original string `s` remain unchanged.
