Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `row`, a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells, and `d`, a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between supports. The function returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated such that each element from index `d` to the end is incremented by the smallest value found in `min_heap` plus one.**
