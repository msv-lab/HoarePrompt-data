Output State: **`j` is 2, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` is equal to `over_sum`, `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`.**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the current value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` was greater than `over_sum` before this assignment, now `over_sum` is equal to `sm`. The other variables (`j`, `lst`, `r`, `l`) remain unchanged.
