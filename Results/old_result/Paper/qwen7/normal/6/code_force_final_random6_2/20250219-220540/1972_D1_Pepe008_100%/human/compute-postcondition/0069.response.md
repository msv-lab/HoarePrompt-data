Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for t in range(T)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `t` and `T`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is greater than or equal to 4.
   - `i` is 5.
   - `x` is 4.
   - `suma` is 15.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `t < T`. Since `t` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue until `t` reaches `T`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was some value (let's say `t_prev`). For the next iteration, `t` will be `t_prev + 1`.
   - Since `i`, `x`, and `suma` are not part of the loop head, their values remain unchanged.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `b` remains greater than or equal to 4.
   - `i` remains 5.
   - `x` remains 4.
   - `suma` remains 15.
   - `t` will be `t_prev + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote it as `t_prev`. However, for the next iteration, `t` will be `t_prev + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`b` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 5, `x` is 4, `suma` is 15, `t` is `t_prev + 1`**.
