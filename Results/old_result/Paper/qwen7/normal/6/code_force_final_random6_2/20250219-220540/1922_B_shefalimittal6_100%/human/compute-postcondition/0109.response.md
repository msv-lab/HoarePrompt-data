Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is calculated based on the specified conditions, `idx` is `n + 3`, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `v` of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. The values of `results`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial states.
