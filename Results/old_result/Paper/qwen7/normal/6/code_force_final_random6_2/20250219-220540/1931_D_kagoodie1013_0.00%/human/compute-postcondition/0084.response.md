Output State: **`count` is `next_num % y` + (-next_num % x) + 2, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 3, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_x = -next_num % x`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 1, `mod_x_key` is `next_num`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` as `-next_num % x`. This does not affect the values of `count`, `arr`, `mod_y_map`, `results`, `mod_x_map`, or `mod_x_key`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states except for the new assignment to `mod_x`.
