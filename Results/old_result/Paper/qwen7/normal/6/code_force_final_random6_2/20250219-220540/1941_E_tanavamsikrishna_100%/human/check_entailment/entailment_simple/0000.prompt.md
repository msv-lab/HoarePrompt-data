Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `row` list will start with 1, and each subsequent element will be 2 more than the previous one, up to the length of the list determined by `d`. The value of `d` must be at least 3 for the loop to run at least three times, and `i` will be set to `d-1` after the loop completes.

    #State: The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches the length of `row`. At this point, `i` will be equal to `len(row)`, and `min_heap` will contain tuples where each tuple consists of an updated value of `row[i]` and the corresponding index `i`. Each element in `row` from index `d` to the end will be updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, where `e[0]` is the smallest value popped from `min_heap` during the execution of the loop. The `min_heap` will reflect these updates, ensuring that the smallest value in `min_heap` is always the smallest updated value in `row` from the current `i` to the end of the list.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which has been updated such that each element from index `d` to the end is incremented by the smallest value found in `min_heap` plus one.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m, k, d) are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0. The sum of n⋅m for all sets of input data does not exceed 2⋅10^5. costs is a list of integers calculated by calling func_1(row, d) for each row in rows. total_costs is a list of integers calculated by summing k consecutive elements from costs.

    #State: Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every consecutive `k` elements of `costs` starting from the first element up to the second-to-last element of `costs`; `rows` is unchanged, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values; `d` retains its original value; `costs` is unchanged; `i` is now equal to `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain sums of all possible consecutive segments of length `k` within the `costs` list. The loop iterates from the start of `costs` to the point where a segment of length `k` can still fit within the list, hence the condition `range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs contains the sums of all possible consecutive segments of length k within the costs list)
