Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, and `flag` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `flag` is set to `False` without affecting the values of `i`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, the conditions for `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain the same as the initial state.
