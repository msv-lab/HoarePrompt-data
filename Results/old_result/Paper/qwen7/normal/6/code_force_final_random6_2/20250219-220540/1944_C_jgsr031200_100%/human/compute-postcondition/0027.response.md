Output State: **`cou` remains 0 or becomes 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `cou`, `i`, or `n`, their states remain unchanged from the initial state, except that the loop continues.
