Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
