Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States:
- `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`
- `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`
- `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state
- `ans` is either 1 or 2
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `k` is less than or equal to \(2 * x\)
- `n` must be at least 2
- `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, where `x` is either `a - x` or `b - x` depending on the condition
- `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`

### Loop Condition:
```
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `k`:**
   - `k` must be non-zero for the loop to continue.
   - Since `k` is initially set to some value (let's say `k = k_initial`), and it decreases within the loop, we need to ensure that `k` is still non-zero at the start of the next iteration.
   
2. **Condition `len(nums) >= 2`:**
   - The length of `nums` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.
   - Initially, `nums` has at least 2 elements because it is a deque with one less element at both ends compared to its original state.
   - Each iteration of the loop removes one element from each end of `nums`, reducing its length by 2.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `nums` must have at least 2 elements remaining.

### Adjusting States:
- **`k`:** We need to ensure that `k` is non-zero at the start of the next iteration. This means we need to keep `k` as it is or adjust it to a non-zero value if it was zeroed out in the loop body.
- **`len(nums)`:** We need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 2 at the start of the next iteration. This means we need to keep `nums` having at least 2 elements.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the conditions `k > 0` and `len(nums) >= 2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, where `x` is either `a - x` or `b - x` depending on the condition, `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`**.
