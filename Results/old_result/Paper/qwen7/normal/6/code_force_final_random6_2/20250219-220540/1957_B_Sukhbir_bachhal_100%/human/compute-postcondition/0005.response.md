Output State: **`position` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `position` right-shifted by 1 bit, and `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9**.

The code `n >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `n` by 1 bit. This means that the value of `n` is divided by 2 (integer division). Since `n` was initially 0, after the operation, `n` remains 0. All other variables (`position`, `t`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
