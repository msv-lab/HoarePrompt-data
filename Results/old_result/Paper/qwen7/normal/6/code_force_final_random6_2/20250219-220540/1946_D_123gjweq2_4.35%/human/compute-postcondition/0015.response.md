Output State: **`new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it, `cur_arr` contains the length reduced by one.**

Explanation: The code `new_arr.append(xor)` appends the value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. The value of `xor` is equal to the first element of `cur_arr`, and `cur_arr` contains the length reduced by one. Therefore, `new_arr` now contains the value of `xor` appended to its existing elements, and `cur_arr` contains the length reduced by one.
