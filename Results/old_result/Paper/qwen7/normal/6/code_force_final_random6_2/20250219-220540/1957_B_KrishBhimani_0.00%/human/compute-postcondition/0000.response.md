Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables**:
   - `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
   - The sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute based on the input value, which is `t`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is a valid input within the specified range.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
