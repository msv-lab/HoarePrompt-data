Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of vertices \( n \) and the number of edges to be removed \( k \). It then constructs the tree using the `Tree` class and adds the edges as specified. The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is used to establish the parent-child relationships within the tree.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum \( x \)**: The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges and ensure that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices. This is done through the `func_4` function, which calls `func_3` to check if a given \( x \) is feasible.

3. **Checking Feasibility with `func_3`**: The `func_3` function uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach via `func_1` to calculate the number of good components (`good_components`) and the remaining size (`remaining_size`) for a given \( x \). A good component is defined as a subtree where the size of the component is at least \( x \).

4. **DFS Implementation**: The DFS implementation in `func_1` and `func_2` correctly traverses the tree and updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each node. The logic ensures that the `good_components` count includes nodes whose size is at least \( x \), and the `remaining_size` is the sum of sizes of subtrees that do not meet the \( x \) requirement.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**: The program handles the constraints appropriately, ensuring that the sum of vertex counts does not exceed \( 10^5 \) and that the number of test cases \( t \) is within the allowed limit.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum \( x \) and handles all specified constraints and requirements, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
