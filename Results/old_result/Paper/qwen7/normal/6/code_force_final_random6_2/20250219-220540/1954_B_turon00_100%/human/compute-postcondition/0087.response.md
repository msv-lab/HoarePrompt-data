Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` must be less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, and the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This means that regardless of the initial value of `ans`, it remains unchanged because `cnt` is now 0. All other conditions and variables remain as they were in the initial state.
