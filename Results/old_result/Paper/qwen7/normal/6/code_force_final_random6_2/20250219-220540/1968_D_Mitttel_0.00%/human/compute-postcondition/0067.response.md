Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length - 2`, `score` is `4 * score + a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `score += a[current_pos - 1]` increments the value of `score` by `a[current_pos - 1]`. All other variables (`full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, `remainder_steps`, `current_pos`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `score` is the original `score` multiplied by 4 plus the value of `a[current_pos - 1]`. The `current_pos` is also updated to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`.
