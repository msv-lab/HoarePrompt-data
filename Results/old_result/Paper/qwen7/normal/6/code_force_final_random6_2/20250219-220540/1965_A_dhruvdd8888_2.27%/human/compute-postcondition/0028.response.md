Postcondition: **`cd` is either 2 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3. If `nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1`, then `cd` is set to 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
