Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `[u, v]` is a list of two integers where `u-1` and `v-1` are connected by an edge in the tree, `[u, v]` is assigned the values from input split and converted to integers.**

The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to the list `[u, v]`. Since the initial state of `i` and `n` is unchanged and the condition for `n` remains the same, these are included in the output state. The list `[u, v]` is updated to hold the integers entered by the user.
