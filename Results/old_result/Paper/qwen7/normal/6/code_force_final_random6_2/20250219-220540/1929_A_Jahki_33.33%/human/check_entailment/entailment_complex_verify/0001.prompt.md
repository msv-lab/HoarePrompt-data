You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array elements, and num2 is not used in the function and can be ignored.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue executing until `i` reaches `num2`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `num2`, and `order` will be incremented each time the condition `a[i-1] >= a[i]` is true. Therefore, `order` will count the number of times an element in the list `a` is greater than or equal to its successor.
    #
    #In summary, the final output state will be a list `a` of integers, an integer `i` equal to `num2`, and an integer `order` that represents the number of adjacent pairs in the list `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and returns `True` if no element in the list is greater than or equal to its successor, otherwise it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is maximized when the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are as large as possible.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It then checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order using `func_1`.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, the beauty is 0 because the differences are non-negative but not necessarily maximized.
   - Otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Checking the Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` checks if the array is in non-decreasing order.
   - This function is correctly implemented and works as expected.

4. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The beauty calculation in the main loop is correct. Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest possible differences, maximizing the beauty.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases like identical elements (e.g., all elements being the same) correctly, resulting in a beauty of 0.
   - The solution also handles small arrays and large values within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the differences. The approach is sound and handles all the given test cases accurately.
