You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

Kostyanych has chosen a complete undirected graph^{\dagger} with n vertices,
and then removed exactly (n - 2) edges from it. You can ask queries of the
following type:

  * "? d " — Kostyanych tells you the number of vertex v with a degree at least d . Among all possible such vertices, he selects the vertex with the minimum degree, and if there are several such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. He also tells you the number of another vertex in the graph, with which v is not connected by an edge (if none is found, then 0 is reported). Among all possible such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. Then he removes the vertex v and all edges coming out of it. If the required vertex v is not found, then "0\ 0 " is reported. 

Find a Hamiltonian path^{\ddagger} in the original graph in at most n queries.
It can be proven that under these constraints, a Hamiltonian path always
exists.

^{\dagger} A complete undirected graph is a graph in which there is exactly
one undirected edge between any pair of distinct vertices. Thus, a complete
undirected graph with n vertices contains \frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges.

^{\ddagger} A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that passes through each
vertex exactly once.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Interaction

Interaction for each test case begins with reading the integer n .

Then you can make no more than n queries.

To make a query, output a line in the format "? d " (without quotes) (0 \le d
\le n - 1 ). After each query, read two integers — the answer to your query.

When you are ready to report the answer, output a line in the format "! v_1\
v_2 \ldots v_n " (without quotes) — the vertices in the order of their
occurrence in the Hamiltonian path. Outputting the answer does not count as
one of the n queries. After solving one test case, the program should
immediately move on to the next one. After solving all test cases, the program
should be terminated immediately.

If your program makes more than n queries for one test case or makes an
incorrect query, then the response to the query will be -1 , and after
receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to
receive the verdict Wrong answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.

After outputting a query, do not forget to output an end of line and flush the
output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Idleness limit
exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 

The interactor is non-adaptive. The graph does not change during the
interaction.

Hacks

To hack, use the following format:

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

Each of the following (n - 2) lines should contains two integers u and v (1
\le u, v \le n , u \ne v ) — ends of the edge that was removed from the graph.
Each edge must not occur more than once.

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^5 .

Note

In the first test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75d8c5328ccca8f82b69ba8300140bed4d40ce80.png)

Consider the queries:

  * There are no vertices with a degree of at least 3 in the graph, so "0\ 0 " is reported.
  * There are four vertices with a degree of at least 2 , and all of them have a degree of exactly 2 : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Vertex 1 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 4 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 1 . After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * There are three vertices with a degree of at least 1 , among them vertices 2 and 3 have a minimum degree of 1 (vertex 4 has a degree of 2 ). Vertex 2 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 3 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 2 . After this, vertex 2 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the second test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/44d26c229eaff752c0a00c7160792daef41c7502.png)

Consider the queries:

  * Vertex 1 has a degree of at least 3 , but it is connected to all vertices, so "1\ 0 " is reported. After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * The remaining vertices 2 , 3 , and 4 have a degree of at least 0 , but among them vertex 4 has the minimum degree of 0 (vertices 2 and 3 have a degree of 1 ). Vertex 4 is not connected to both vertices 2 and 3 , so vertex 2 is reported (as it has the minimum number). After this, vertex 4 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the third test case, the graph consists of 2 vertices connected by an edge.

- Annotated Code: 
import sys

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    func_2(n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= n - 1, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.
def func_1(d):
    print(f'? {d}')
    #This is printed: ? d (where d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= n - 1)

    return v, u
    #The program returns two values, `v` and `u`, where `v` is an input integer and `u` is another input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `d` within the range of 0 to n-1, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. It then reads two integers `v` and `u` from user input and returns these two integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
def func_2(n):
    path = []
    remaining_vertices = set(range(1, n + 1))
    while remaining_vertices:
        for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            v, u = func_1(d)
            if v == 0:

                break
        
    #State: Output State: `d` is -1, `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations, `path` contains all vertices that satisfy the given conditions, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set since all vertices from 1 to `n` have been processed and added to `path`.
    #
    #In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning it has iterated through all possible values of `d` from `n-1` down to `-1`. The variable `d` will have reached `-1`, indicating the end of the loop. The variable `v` will hold the last value returned by `func_1(-1)`, and `u` will hold the corresponding second return value. The `path` list will contain all the vertices that met the condition of being in `remaining_vertices` and were successfully appended to `path` before being removed from `remaining_vertices`. Finally, `remaining_vertices` will be an empty set because all vertices from 1 to `n` have been processed.
    print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")
    #This is printed: ! path (where path contains all vertices that satisfied the given conditions)
    sys.stdout.flush()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` and constructs a path containing all vertices from 1 to `n` that satisfy certain conditions. It uses a loop to iterate through possible values of `d` from `n-1` down to `-1`, calling another function `func_1(d)` to get pairs of vertices `(v, u)`. If `v` is found in the set of remaining vertices, it is added to the path and removed from the set. After processing all vertices, it prints the path and ensures the set of remaining vertices is empty.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function prints a query to the standard output asking for the number of vertices with a degree at least `d`.
   - It then reads the response from the standard input and returns the values `v` and `u`.
   - This function correctly implements the query mechanism described in the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the queries provided by `func_1`.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices in the Hamiltonian path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
   - It enters a loop that continues until all vertices are processed (`remaining_vertices` is empty).
     - For each degree `d` from `n-1` down to 0, it calls `func_1(d)` to get the vertex `v` and the non-adjacent vertex `u`.
     - If `v` is 0, it means no vertex with the current degree `d` exists, so it continues to the next degree.
     - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
   - Finally, it prints the path and flushes the output buffer.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Query Mechanism**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly sends queries and processes the responses as per the problem statement.
   
2. **Path Construction**:
   - The function `func_2` iteratively finds vertices with the highest degrees and ensures that the selected vertex is not already in the path.
   - By removing the selected vertex and all edges connected to it, the function progressively builds a Hamiltonian path.
   - The approach of starting from the highest degree and moving downwards ensures that the path is constructed correctly, as the removal of vertices and edges maintains the connectivity necessary for a Hamiltonian path.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The function stops when all vertices are added to the path, ensuring that a Hamiltonian path is found within the allowed number of queries.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path using the specified queries. The approach ensures that the path is built correctly and efficiently within the constraints.
