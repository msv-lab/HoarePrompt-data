You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 0, `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 489, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10, 10].
    #
    #Explanation: After the first three iterations, the value of `i` can either be 0 or 10. If `i` is 0, the loop breaks immediately as it does not satisfy the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. Therefore, `i` remains 0, and no further iterations occur. The value of `mx` remains 10 because it was last updated to 10 during the third iteration, and `x` is reduced to 489 after the third iteration. The list `subseq_lens` contains [10, 10] because `i` was 10 twice in the previous iterations. If `i` is 10, the loop continues, but since `x` is now 489, the inner while loop's condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` will not be satisfied for any `i`, leading to the same final state as when `i` is 0.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 5; `ansv` contains the elements `subseq_lens[2]`, `subseq_lens[3]`, and `subseq_lens[4]`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `len(subseq_lens) - 1`. Given `subseq_lens` is a list with 2 elements, the loop will run until `i` reaches 4 (since `range(1, len(subseq_lens))` means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `len(subseq_lens)`). After the loop completes, `i` will be 5, and `ansv` will contain the elements `subseq_lens[1]`, `subseq_lens[2]`, and `subseq_lens[3]`, which are `[10, 10, 10]` based on the initial list provided.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 3
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `i` is 5, `ansv` contains the elements `[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`
    print()
    #This is printed: None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^18. The function returns a result based on the given constraints.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
