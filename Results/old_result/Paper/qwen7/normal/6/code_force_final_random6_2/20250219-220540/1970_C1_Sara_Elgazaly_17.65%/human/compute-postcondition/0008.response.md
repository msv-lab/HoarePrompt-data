Output State: **`x` must be greater than 2, `y` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\), `a` is the first integer input from the user, `b` is the second integer input from the user, and both are integers, and `lst[a]` now includes `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b` to the list `lst[a]`. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only change is that `lst[a]` now contains the value `b`.
