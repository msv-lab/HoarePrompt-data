Output State: **`a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`; `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`; `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state; `ans` is either 1 or 2; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `k` must be greater than 0; `n` must be at least 2; `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`; `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `nums`, `ans`, `t`, `k`, `n`, `x`, and the condition on `b` remain unchanged. We simply note that the execution breaks out of the current loop or conditional structure.
