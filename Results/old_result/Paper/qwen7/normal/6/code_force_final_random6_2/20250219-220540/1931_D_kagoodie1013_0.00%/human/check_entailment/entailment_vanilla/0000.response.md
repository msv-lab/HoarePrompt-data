Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into chunks for each test case. It then processes each test case one by one.
2. **Data Structure Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
3. **Count Calculation**: For each element in the array, it calculates the remainder when the element is divided by `x` and `y`. It uses these remainders to find the number of previously seen elements that form a "beautiful pair" with the current element.
4. **Modulo Handling**: The program handles negative numbers correctly by using `-num % x` to ensure the remainder is non-negative.
5. **Result Collection**: The count of beautiful pairs for each test case is collected and returned.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to correctly calculate the number of beautiful pairs according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
