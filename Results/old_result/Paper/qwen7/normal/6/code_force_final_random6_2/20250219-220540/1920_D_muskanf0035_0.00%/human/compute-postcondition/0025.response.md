Output State: The `queries` list has been fully iterated over, meaning `k` has taken on each value in `queries` exactly once. For each iteration, `result` has had an element appended to it, where the element is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`. Therefore, `result` is a list containing all the values of `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` for each `k` in `queries`, in the order they appeared in `queries`. The `array` remains unchanged throughout the process.

In simpler terms, `result` is a list that contains the elements of `array` indexed by the elements of `queries` (with wrapping around the length of `array` if necessary), and `array` stays the same as it was initially.
