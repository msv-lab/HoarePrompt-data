Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is 0, `n - 2` is less than 1, `temp` is a slice of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 3**.

The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` creates a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 3`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `i`, the output state only describes the slice operation without specifying the exact values in the slice. All other variables remain unchanged.
