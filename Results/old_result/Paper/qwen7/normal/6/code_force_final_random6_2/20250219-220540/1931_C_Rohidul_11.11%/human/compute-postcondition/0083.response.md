Based on the initial state provided:

- `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are all equal to `n - 1`.
- `ans` is either `n - 3` or `0` depending on whether the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.
- The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.

Given this information, we can determine that `ans` must be `0` because the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.

The `print` statement is `print(max(0, ans))`. Since `ans` is `0`, `max(0, ans)` will simply return `0`.

Output: **0**
