Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, and `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. The condition `space_x <= remaining_cells` is false.**
