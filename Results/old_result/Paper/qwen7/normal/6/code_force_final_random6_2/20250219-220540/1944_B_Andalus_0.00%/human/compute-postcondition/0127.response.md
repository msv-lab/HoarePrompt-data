Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `elem` and `rdb`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `rdb`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains at least one element (excluding the one processed in the current iteration), `sz` is either 5 or 7, and `sng` must contain at least two elements.
   - If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` becomes 7. Otherwise, `sz` remains 5.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `rdb`, one element from `rdb` has been processed in the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, `rdb` now contains at least one less element than before.
   - The value of `sz` could either remain 5 or change to 7 based on the condition `k - sz >= 2`.
   - `ldb` remains empty as it was not modified within the loop.
   - `sng` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `ldb` remains empty.
- `rdb` now contains at least one less element than before.
- `sz` could be either 5 or 7 depending on the condition `k - sz >= 2`.
- `sng` must still contain at least two elements.

Since we don't know the exact value of `sz` after the condition check, we'll keep both possibilities.

**Final State:**
- `ldb` is empty.
- `rdb` contains at least one less element than before.
- `sz` is either 5 or 7.
- `sng` must contain at least two elements.

So, the final state is:

State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains at least one less element than before, `sz` is either 5 or 7, and `sng` must contain at least two elements.**
