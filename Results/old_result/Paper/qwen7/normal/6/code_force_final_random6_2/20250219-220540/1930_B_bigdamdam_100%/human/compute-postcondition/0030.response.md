Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1000.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `p[i]` is `ind + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.
   - `ind` is `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive), so the loop variable `i` increments by 1 each iteration.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range of `range(n)`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n`.
   - Since `i` is now `n`, it does not satisfy the condition `i < n` anymore, and the loop will terminate.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be `n` (which is `n`).
   - `p[i]` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `p[i]`.
   - `ind` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `ind`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the termination of the loop) will be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1000; `i` is `n`; `p[i]` is `ind + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`; `ind` is `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`**.
