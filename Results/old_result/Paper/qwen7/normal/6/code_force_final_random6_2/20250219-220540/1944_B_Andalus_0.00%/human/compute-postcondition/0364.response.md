Output State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a list containing unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`, `n` is the total length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end (which is an empty list in this case), `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing the last element of `rgt` (if there are any elements in `rgt`), `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n-1` (which is the entire list `lst` since `n` is the total length of `lst`).**

In this final state, the loop has executed for all possible iterations, meaning `i` has reached the length of `lst`. At this point, `n` is equal to the length of `lst`, making `lft` a sorted version of the entire `lst`. The variable `rdb` will contain the last element of `rgt` if `rgt` was not empty during the loop's execution.
