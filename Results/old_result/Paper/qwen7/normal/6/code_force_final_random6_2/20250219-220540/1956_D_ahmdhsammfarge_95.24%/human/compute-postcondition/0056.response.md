Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j` and `i`.
- If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `i` and `l` is set to `j`.
- If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, there is no change to `r` and `l`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- The loop variable `j` ranges from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`.
- The loop does not directly modify `i`, `r`, or `l`.

### Adjusting States
At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j` and `i`.
- `r` and `l` are either unchanged or updated based on the condition `sm > over_sum`.

For the next iteration of the loop, the only variable that changes is `j`. The value of `j` increases by 1 each time the loop iterates.

### Next Iteration
- The new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
- Since `r` and `l` are not directly modified by the loop itself, they remain the same unless the condition `sm > over_sum` is met during the current iteration.

### Updated State
State: **`sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j + 1` in list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j + 1` and `i`, `r` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged.**

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j + 1` in list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j + 1` and `i`, `r` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged.**
