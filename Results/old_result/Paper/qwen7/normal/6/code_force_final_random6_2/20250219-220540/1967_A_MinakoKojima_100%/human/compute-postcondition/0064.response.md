Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `k` is `-dif * 3`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, and `res` is -4.**

Explanation: The code `res -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `res`. Initially, `res` is -3. After executing the code, `res` becomes -3 - 1, which is -4. The values of the other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
