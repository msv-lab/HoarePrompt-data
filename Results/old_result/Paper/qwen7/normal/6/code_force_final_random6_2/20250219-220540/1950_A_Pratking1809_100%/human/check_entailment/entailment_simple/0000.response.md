### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) from the input. This part is also correct.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is met.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is met.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

4. **Output Format**: The program outputs the results in the correct format, matching the example provided.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` correctly according to the problem statement. It correctly identifies stairs, peaks, and when neither condition is met.

6. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each test case exactly once, ensuring that all test cases are processed.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
