Output State: **`nabors` is decremented by 1; `aa` is a list of integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list to the variable `aa`. The variable `nabors` is decremented by 1 but no specific value is given for `nabors` initially, so it is only mentioned that it is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this code and are assumed to be assigned values from the input split into a list of integers, which is now stored in `aa`.
