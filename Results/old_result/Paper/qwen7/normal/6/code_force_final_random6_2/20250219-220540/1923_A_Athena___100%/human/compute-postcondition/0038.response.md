Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a value between 0 and 1000 (though this variable does not affect the output of the `print(res)` statement).
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the output of `res`).
- `a` is a list with at least 3 elements.
- `res` is explicitly stated to be 3.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 2, but this value is not used in the final output.

Given that the loop has executed 3 times, and `res` is set to 3, it indicates that there were at least 3 zeros in the list `a`.

Output: **3**
