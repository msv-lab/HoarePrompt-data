Output State: **`in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` is the corresponding element in `aa[:n - m]`; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increases the value of `C[out_aa]` by 1 and decreases the value of `D[out_aa]` by 1. The values of `in_aa` and `out_aa` remain unchanged from their initial states.
