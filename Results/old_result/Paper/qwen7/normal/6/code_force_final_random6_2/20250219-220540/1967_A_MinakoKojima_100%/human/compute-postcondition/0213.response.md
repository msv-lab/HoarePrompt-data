Output State: **`i` is 1; `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`**

Explanation: The code `dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]` calculates the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression `a[i + 1] - a[i]` becomes `a[2] - a[1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, so it is still 1. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value for `dif` and the unchanged value for `i`.
