Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case does not explicitly define any variables like in the previous examples. However, the loop's continuation depends on the value of `n`, which must be greater than 1.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` was greater than 1.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the only variable directly controlling the loop's continuation is `n`, and it must remain greater than 1 for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than 1.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `n` is still greater than 1.

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `2 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `7 * y + x + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2)` if `y` is even or `15 * (y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - 2 * y`, `result` contains either `screen_require_for_y` or a list containing one element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.**
