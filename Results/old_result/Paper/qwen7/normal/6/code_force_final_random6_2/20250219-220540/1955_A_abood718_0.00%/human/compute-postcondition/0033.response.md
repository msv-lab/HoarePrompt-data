Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: 
   - `i` is 2 (though this value is not used in the code snippet).
   - `A` is an input integer.
   - `B` is an input integer.
   - `C` is an input integer.
   - `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

2. The code snippet to execute is:
   ```python
   print(X)
   ```

3. Since `X` is defined as `A // 2`, the value of `X` will be the integer division of `A` by 2.

4. The `print` statement will output the value of `X`.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the integer division of `A` by 2.

Output: **A // 2 (where A is an input integer)**
