Output State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since the initial conditions for `sz` and `rdb` remain unchanged, they are still as described in the initial state.
