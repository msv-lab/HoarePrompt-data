Output State: **`i` is one of the elements in `arr`, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list with the element `k0 - sum(ans)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `k0` and `ans`, we know that `ans` is now a list with one additional element, which is the result of `k0 - sum(ans)`. The conditions and lists `i` and `arr` remain unchanged.
