Output State: **`a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`; `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`; `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state; `ans` is either 1 or 2; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `k` must be greater than 0; `n` must be at least 2; `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`; `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `a` and `b` to `x`. The values of `a`, `b`, `nums`, `ans`, `t`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `x` is updated to be the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `ans` is 2, then `b` should be less than or equal to 0; otherwise, `b` is appended to `nums`.
