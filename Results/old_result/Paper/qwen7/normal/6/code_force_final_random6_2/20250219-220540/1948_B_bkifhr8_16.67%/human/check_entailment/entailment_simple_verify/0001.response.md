### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It then iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

#### Operation Implementation:
- The program attempts to implement the operation by iterating through the array and checking if the current element is greater than the previous one and greater than 10.
- If the condition is met, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
- However, the implementation of the digit splitting and insertion is indeed incorrect. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits.

#### Sorting Check:
- After attempting to apply the operation, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function, which simply compares the original array with its sorted version.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Digit Splitting and Insertion:**
   - The current implementation does not correctly split the element into its digits and insert them back into the array.
   - The logic inside the loop where it tries to split and insert digits is flawed and does not achieve the desired effect.

2. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The loop only checks if the current element is greater than the previous one and greater than 10, but it does not actually perform the necessary operations to transform the array into a sorted one.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, the program should:
1. Apply the operation of splitting elements into digits and inserting them back into the array until no more operations can be performed.
2. After applying the operation, check if the array is sorted.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code shows that the program attempts to split and insert digits, but the logic is incorrect.
- The `func_1` function checks if the array is sorted, which is a good approach, but it doesn't address the issue of the incorrect digit splitting and insertion.

### Corrected Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
1. Iterating through the array and performing the digit splitting and insertion operation whenever an element is greater than 10 and greater than the previous element.
2. Repeating this process until no more operations can be performed.
3. Finally, checking if the array is sorted.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original program, the provided program does not correctly implement the required operations and thus cannot be considered correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
