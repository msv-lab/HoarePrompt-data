Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from the input split by space, `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `c` is the final cumulative value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and the value of `c` when `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)` is false, or 0 when it is true, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `int(input())` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `l`. The variables `n`, `k`, `c`, `maxi`, `i`, and `int(input())` remain unchanged from their previous states.
