Output State: **`ans` is `n`, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`. The current value of `g` is less than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement. Therefore, the values of `ans`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged.
