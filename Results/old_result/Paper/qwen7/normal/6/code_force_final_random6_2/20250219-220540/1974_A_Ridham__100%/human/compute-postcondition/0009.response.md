Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, and `y` is an even number.**

Explanation: The code `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` assigns the value of `y` divided by 2 (integer division) to the variable `screen_require_for_y`. Since `y` is an even number, the value of `screen_require_for_y` will be half of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
