Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two integers, `n` and `k`, with constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3. For each test case, the function determines and returns some result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes a series of test cases, each containing integers `n` and `k`, and returns a specific value or result for each test case based on these inputs. However, without additional details on the exact computation or return value for each test case, the precise functionality cannot be fully specified beyond the described structure.
