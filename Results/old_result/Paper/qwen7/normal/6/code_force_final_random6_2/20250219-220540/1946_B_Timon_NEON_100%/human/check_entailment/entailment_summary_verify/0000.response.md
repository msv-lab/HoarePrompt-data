### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an array by performing up to `k` operations.
- Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
- The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1`: Takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `func_2`: Finds the maximum sum subarray. However, this function is not being used in the main logic.
   - `func_3`: Accepts an integer `number` (sum of the original array) and a non-negative integer `quantity` (number of operations). It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to maximize the sum.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - There is no main function or logic that uses the provided functions to solve the problem.
   - The program does not handle the core logic of performing the operations to maximize the sum of the array.

#### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is correctly defined and used to compute the sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is part of the problem requirements.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function finds the maximum sum subarray, but it is not utilized in the main logic to solve the problem.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is partially implemented but does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to maximize the sum.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program lacks the main logic to perform the operations as described in the problem statement. It does not use `func_2` or any other mechanism to insert the sum of subarrays back into the array.

#### Potential Case Analysis:
- Consider the example provided in the problem description:
  ```
  2 1
  -4 -7
  ```
  - The optimal strategy would be to take the sum of the entire array and insert it back into the array. This would result in the array becoming `[11, -7]`, with a sum of `4`.
  - However, the program does not perform this operation, leading to an incorrect result.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.
