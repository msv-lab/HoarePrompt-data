Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is odd. According to the problem description, if `n` is odd, the output should be 'NO'. However, the current implementation prints 'NO' only when `n` is odd, but it does not check for this condition before generating the string. For example, if `n = 1`, the program should print 'NO', but it generates and prints the string 'AAB' which has 3 special characters, not 1. This violates the problem description.
