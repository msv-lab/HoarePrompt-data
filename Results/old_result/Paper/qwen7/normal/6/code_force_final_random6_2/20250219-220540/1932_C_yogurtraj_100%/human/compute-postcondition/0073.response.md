Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an integer, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `y[-1]` is equal to `k`, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, and the first element of `t` is not 'R'**.

Explanation: The code `q1 -= 1` decrements the value of `q1` by 1. Since the initial value of `y[-1]` is `k`, and `k` is defined as `k * a[q1] % m`, the value of `y[-1]` remains unchanged. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state, except for `q1`, which is now `q1 - 1`. Therefore, `i` is updated to `n - 3` because `i` was initially `n - 2`.
