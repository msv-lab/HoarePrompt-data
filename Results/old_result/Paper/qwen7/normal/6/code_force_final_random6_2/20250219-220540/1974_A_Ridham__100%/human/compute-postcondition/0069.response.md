Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\) (where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\)). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given conditions and appends it to a list. Finally, it prints each value in the list on a new line. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints a list of integers derived from the input values.**
