Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `x` is an integer value from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `x`. The precondition that `n` must be a positive integer remains unchanged. The new information is that `x` now holds an integer value from `data[idx]`.
