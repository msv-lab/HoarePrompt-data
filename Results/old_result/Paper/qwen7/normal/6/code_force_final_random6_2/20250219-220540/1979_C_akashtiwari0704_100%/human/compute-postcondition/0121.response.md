Output State: **`i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 10, `ans` is updated by adding the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the variable `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is equal to `bets`) with a space. The values of `i` and `bets` remain unchanged, and the updated value of `ans` includes the new string added to it.
