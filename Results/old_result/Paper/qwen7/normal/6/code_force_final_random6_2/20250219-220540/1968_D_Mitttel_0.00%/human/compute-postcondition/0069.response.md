Output State: `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length - (remainder_steps % cycle_length - 1)`, `score` is `4 * score + sum of a[current_pos - 1] for each iteration`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `full_cycles` will be the integer division of `remaining_steps` by `cycle_length`. `remaining_steps` will be the remainder when `k - steps` is divided by `cycle_length`. `cycle_score` and `cycle_pos` will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. `remainder_steps` will be `remaining_steps % cycle_length` after all iterations. The `score` will be the initial score plus four times the previous score plus the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration of the loop. `current_pos` will be updated to `p[current_pos - 1]` after each iteration.
