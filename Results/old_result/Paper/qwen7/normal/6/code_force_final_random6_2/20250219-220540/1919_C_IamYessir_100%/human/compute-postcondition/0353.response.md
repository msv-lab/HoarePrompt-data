Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with the last element being `lit[0]` and `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). The current value of `x` is greater than `y`, and if the condition `(x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y)` is satisfied, then `x` remains unchanged and the condition `x > y` still holds. If the condition is not satisfied, `x` remains unchanged and the condition `x > y` still holds.
