Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `4 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `5 * y + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - 4 * y`, `result` now contains either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` depending on whether `x` is less than or equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - 4 * y`.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `space_x` from `x * 4` to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `space_x` is updated to `x`, while the expressions involving `space_y`, `total_space`, `remaining_cells`, and `result` are adjusted accordingly.
