Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is converted to an integer from the string `r`, `c` is a string.**

Explanation: The code `r = int(r)` converts the string `r` to an integer and assigns it to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.
