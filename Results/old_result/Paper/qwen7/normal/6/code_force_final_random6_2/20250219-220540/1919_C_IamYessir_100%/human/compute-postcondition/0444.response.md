Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where the last element is the value appended from `lit[i]`, `b` is a list with two elements and the last element is `b[1]`, and `y` is `b[1]` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 2, the last element of `a` will be `lit[2]`. All other variables (`n`, `b`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
