Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the functions `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_1` processes the operations to build the array `array` and then uses the queries to find the corresponding elements in the array.
3. `func_2` reads the necessary inputs, calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters, and prints the results.
4. The logic in both functions aligns with the problem description and examples provided.
5. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code that would cause incorrect behavior based on the given problem constraints and examples.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
