Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `t + 1`.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `m` is the second input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The print statement is `print(k)`, which means it will print the value of `k`.

The value of `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \( k = |n - m| \).

Therefore, the output will be the absolute difference between the two input integers `n` and `m`.

Output: **|n - m|**
