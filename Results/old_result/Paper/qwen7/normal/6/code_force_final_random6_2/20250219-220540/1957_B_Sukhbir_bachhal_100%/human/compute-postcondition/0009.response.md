Output State: **`position` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 1, and `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\)**.

Explanation: The initial value of `position` is 2. After executing `position += 1`, `position` is incremented by 1, making its new value 3. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet. `n` is defined as `position` right-shifted by 1 bit, which results in `n` being 1 (since shifting 2 right by 1 bit gives 1).
