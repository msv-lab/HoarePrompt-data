Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(2, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `dp` is a list containing `[6, 18]`, and `i` is 5.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `2` and goes up to `n + 1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Analyze the current value of `i`**: Currently, `i` is 5.

5. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented within the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `6`.

6. **Determine the new value of `n`**: For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than `i`. Since `i` is now `6`, `n` must be greater than `6`.

7. **Adjust the state**: The only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `n`. The state of `dp` does not change as it is not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`dp` is a list containing [6, 18], `i` is 6, `n` must be greater than 6**
