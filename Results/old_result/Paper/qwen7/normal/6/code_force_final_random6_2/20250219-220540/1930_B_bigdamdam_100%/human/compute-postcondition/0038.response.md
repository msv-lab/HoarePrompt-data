Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `p[0]` is `n`, `ind` is `n - 2`, `p[2]` is `n - 2`**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` updates the list `p` such that the element at index `i` (which is 2) is set to the value of `ind` (which is `n - 2`). All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `p[2]` is now `n - 2`.
