Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: 
   - `i` is 3.
   - `k` is decreased by `dic[l[3]]`.
   - `k` is less than or equal to 0.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. Analysis:
   - The value of `k` is not explicitly mentioned, but it is stated that `k` is decreased by `dic[l[3]]` and then `k` is less than or equal to 0. This means the value of `k` after the operation is 0 or a negative number.
   - The `print` statement does not depend on the value of `k` or any other variable; it simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
