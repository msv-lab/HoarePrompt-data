Output State: **`ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is a list which is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `onum[0]` to `symb2`. Since `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `onum[0]` is the same as `num[-1]`, which is also equal to `symb1`. Therefore, `symb2` is equal to `symb1`, which is `num[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
