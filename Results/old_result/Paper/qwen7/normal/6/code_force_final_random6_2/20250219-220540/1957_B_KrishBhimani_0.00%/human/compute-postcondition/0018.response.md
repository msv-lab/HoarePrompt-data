Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is greater than 0 and now equal to `k // 2`, and `arr` is a list containing the values 0 and 1. If `k` was odd, `arr` is updated to contain the values 0 and 1.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`. This operation divides `k` by 2 and discards the remainder. Since `k` is initially a positive integer, after the operation, `k` is now equal to `k // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. If `k` was odd before the operation, `arr` remains unchanged as it was already updated to contain the values 0 and 1.
