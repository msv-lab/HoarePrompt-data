Output State: **`s` is `k * c * i * c * m + k * c * a`, `i` is `100000 + m`, `k` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is the sum of `a` plus `f` for each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The values of `s`, `i`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged, and the value of `a` is updated as the sum of its previous value and `f` for each iteration of the loop. However, since no loop is mentioned in the code, the value of `a` remains unchanged. The values of `s` and `i` are dependent on the initial conditions and are not directly affected by the input values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
