Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an input integer, `word` is the string 'aaa', `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The code appends the string `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` to the existing string `word`. Since `word` was initially an empty string, it becomes `'aaa'` after appending `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`, assuming `alphabet[n - 3]` is `'a'` (as it's the simplest case without knowing the exact value of `n`). The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
