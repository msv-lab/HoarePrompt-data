Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(1, n)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will start when `i` is 1 and continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is initially set to `n` (as stated in the problem), the loop will not start because `i` is not within the range `1` to `n-1`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initially `n`, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range `1` to `n-1` for the loop to start.
   - The value of `n` should be such that there is at least one valid `i` in the range `1` to `n-1`.

Given these points, we need to adjust `i` to be `1` and ensure that `n` is at least `2` (since `n > 2` is already given and `n` cannot be `1` for the loop to start).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2**
