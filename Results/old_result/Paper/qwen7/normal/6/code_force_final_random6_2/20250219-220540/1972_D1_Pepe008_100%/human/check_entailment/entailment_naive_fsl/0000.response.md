Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the formula used in the loop to calculate `x` does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement.

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program attempts to use a different approach involving the value of \(i\) and does not correctly handle the gcd condition.

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- According to the problem, valid pairs include \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\), which totals 14 pairs.
- However, the program outputs 14 for this case, which seems correct initially. But upon closer inspection, the program's logic does not correctly account for all valid pairs due to the incorrect formula used.

A correct implementation would involve iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the solution, it fails for at least one case, hence the correctness is **False**.
