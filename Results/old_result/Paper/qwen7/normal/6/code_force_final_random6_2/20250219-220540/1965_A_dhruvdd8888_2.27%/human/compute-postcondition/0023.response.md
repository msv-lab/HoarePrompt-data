Postcondition: `cd` is either 1 or 0, depending on whether the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is equal to 1. Specifically, if the difference is 1, `cd` is set to 1; otherwise, `cd` remains 0. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3.
