Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `l` and `r`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `l <= r`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.

4. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `l <= r` must be true.
   - Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, the condition `0 <= n - 1` is always true for any positive integer `n`.

Since the condition `l <= r` is always true given the current values of `l` and `r`, no adjustments are necessary.

**Conclusion**: The loop can execute the first time without any modifications to the states of `l` or `r`.

**Answer**:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1**
