Output State: **`segments_variants` is now ['new_segment', 'i - 1'], `new_segment` remains unchanged, `max_segment` is ['new_segment', 'i - 1'], `max_sum` is -1, `arr` remains unchanged, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0, and max_segment[0] is equal to new_segment[0].**

Explanation: The code sets `max_segment` to the value of `new_segment`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `new_segment` is set to `max_segment`, `max_segment` now becomes `['new_segment', 'i - 1']`. The conditions about `arr[i]` being less than 0 and `max_segment[0]` being less than or equal to `new_segment[0]` are still valid.
