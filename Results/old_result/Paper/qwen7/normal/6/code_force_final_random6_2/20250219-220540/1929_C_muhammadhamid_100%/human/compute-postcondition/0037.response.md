Output State: `i` is equal to the value of `x` which was set initially, `x` retains its initial value from the input (new_x), and `s` is equal to the final value calculated after all iterations of the loop, which is `s = (2^x - 1) * (k - 1) + 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `x` because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The variable `x` retains its initial value from the input since it is not modified within the loop. The variable `s` is updated in each iteration according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. Starting from `s = 1`, after `x` iterations, `s` will be the sum of a geometric series plus some additional terms, resulting in `s = (2^x - 1) * (k - 1) + 1`.
