Output State: **`ans` contains all possible players who could have the ball except 0, and `temp` holds the same set of values as the updated `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the element `0` from the set `ans`. Since `temp` initially holds the same set of values as `ans`, it remains unchanged. Therefore, `temp` still contains all the players who could have the ball, including all elements except `0`.
