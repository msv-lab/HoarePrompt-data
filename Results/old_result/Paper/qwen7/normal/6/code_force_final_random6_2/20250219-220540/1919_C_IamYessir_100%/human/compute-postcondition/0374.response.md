Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the element `lit[0]` with `x` being infinity or the last element of the updated list `a`, `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` (which is `lit[0]` since `i` is 0) to the list `a`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
