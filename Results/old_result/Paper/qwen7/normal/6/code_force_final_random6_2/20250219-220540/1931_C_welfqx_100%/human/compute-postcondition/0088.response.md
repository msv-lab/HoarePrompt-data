Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, and `f`. It only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
