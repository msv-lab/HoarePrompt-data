Output State: **`a` is an integer value, `t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `b` is an integer value.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5`, which means `t` is now the integer division of its original value by 5. Since `t` was originally equal to `b * 2`, the new value of `t` is `b * 2 // 5`. All other variables (`a`, `n`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
