Output State: **`ind` is `n`, `i` is 8, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `p[8]` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the index `i` in the list `p`. Given that `i` is 8, `ind` is `n`, and `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, after executing the code, `p[8]` will be set to `n`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
