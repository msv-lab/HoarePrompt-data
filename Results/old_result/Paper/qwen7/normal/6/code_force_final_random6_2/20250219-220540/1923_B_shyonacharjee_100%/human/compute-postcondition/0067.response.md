Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **can_survive**: The initial state explicitly states that `can_survive` is `False`.
2. **bullets_used**: The initial state mentions that `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters. Since all monsters have been processed and `monsters` is an empty list, it implies no monsters were left with any health, so `bullets_used` would be the sum of the health values of these non-existent monsters. However, since there are no monsters, `bullets_used` is effectively 0.
3. **monsters**: The initial state explicitly states that `monsters` is an empty list.

Given the expression `print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')`:
- Since `can_survive` is `False`, the condition `if can_survive` evaluates to `False`.
- Therefore, the `else` part of the conditional expression is executed, printing `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
