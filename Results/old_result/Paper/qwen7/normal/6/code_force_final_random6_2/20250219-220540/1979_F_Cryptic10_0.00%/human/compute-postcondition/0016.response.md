Output State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding 0, `d` is `n-2`, and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop continues, the values of `v`, `u`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, and `d` remain unchanged.
