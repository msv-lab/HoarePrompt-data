Postcondition: `i` is 3, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is adjusted based on the condition: if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `res` is decreased by 1 and `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`; otherwise, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`, `k` is reset to 0, and `ans` remains unchanged. This holds true regardless of whether `k` is 0 or not, as the if part covers all possible scenarios.
