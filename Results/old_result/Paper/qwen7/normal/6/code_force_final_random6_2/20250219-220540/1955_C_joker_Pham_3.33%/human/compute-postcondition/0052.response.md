Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is greater than or equal to \(a[r] \times 2 - a[r] \times 2\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2, and the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]\).**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by `a[r] * 2`. Given that `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, the new value of `k` is `k - a[r] * 2`, which simplifies to `k - 2 * a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
