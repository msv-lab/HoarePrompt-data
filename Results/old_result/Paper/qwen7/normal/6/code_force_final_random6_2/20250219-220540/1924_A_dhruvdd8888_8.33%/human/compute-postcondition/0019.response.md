Output State: **`i` is added to the set `win`, `s` is the original string, `us` is unchanged, `win` is now a set containing the elements `i` and `ans[0]`, `ans` is now a list containing the element `i`, `ps` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was previously unchanged and assumed to contain one element (let's denote it as `ans[0]`), after appending `i`, `ans` now contains two elements: `ans[0]` and `i`. The other variables (`s`, `us`, `win`, and `ps`) remain unchanged.
