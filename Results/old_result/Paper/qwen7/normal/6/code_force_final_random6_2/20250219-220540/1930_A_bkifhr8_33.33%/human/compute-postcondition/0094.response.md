Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is less than `n * 2`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`
   - If the length of `lst` is not 2, the second element of `lst` (index 1) is removed; otherwise, the value of `ans` is the original `ans` plus the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in `range(n * 2)`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `i < n * 2`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i < n * 2` needs to hold true for the next iteration.

4. **States to Adjust:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
   - We need to ensure that the postconditions related to `ans` and `lst` remain valid for the next iteration.

5. **Postconditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` should be less than `n * 2` for the next iteration.
   - `ans` should be updated based on the same logic as before.
   - If the length of `lst` is not 2, the second element of `lst` (index 1) should be removed; otherwise, `ans` should be updated by adding the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ans` is updated based on the same logic as before.
- `lst` is checked for its length and updated accordingly.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is less than `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and if the length of `lst` is not 2, the second element of `lst` (index 1) is removed; otherwise, the value of `ans` is the original `ans` plus the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`**.
