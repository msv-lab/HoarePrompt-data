Output State: **`i` is 3, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is `res - 1`, `k` is 0, and `ans` is `ans + dif`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif` adds the value of `dif` to `ans`. Since `dif` is defined as `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `ans` now includes this difference. All other variables (`i`, `res`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
