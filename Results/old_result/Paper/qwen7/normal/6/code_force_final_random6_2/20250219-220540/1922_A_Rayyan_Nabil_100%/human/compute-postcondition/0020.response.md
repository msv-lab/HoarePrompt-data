Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

In this case, the code simply takes an input, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `c`. The other variables (`results`, `n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
