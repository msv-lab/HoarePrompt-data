The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. The function returns a list that combines the quotients from the division of `x` by its divisors (in descending order) with the divisors themselves (also in descending order). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return a list containing the divisors of `x` (in descending order) followed by their corresponding quotients when `x` is divided by these divisors (also in descending order).
