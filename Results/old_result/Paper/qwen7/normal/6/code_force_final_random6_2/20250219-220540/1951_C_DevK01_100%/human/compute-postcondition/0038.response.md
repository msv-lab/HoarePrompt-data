To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t > 1`: This tells us that `t` is some value greater than 1, but its exact value isn't needed for determining `cost`.
   - `L` is a list of integers where:
     - `L[0]` is the length of the list `N`.
     - `L[1]` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`.
     - `L[2]` is the third element of `L`.
   - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.

2. **Conditions for Calculating `cost`:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, if `n * m != k`, then:
     - `N` is modified to exclude the last element of `M`.
     - `w` is the last element of `N` before it is popped.
     - `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - `cost` is updated to include `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Given the conditions, the exact value of `cost` depends on the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `q`. However, since these values are not explicitly provided, we need to describe the formula used to calculate `cost`.

Based on the initial state and the conditions, the formula for `cost` can be described as follows:

- If `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- Otherwise, `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * (k - (n - 1) * m)`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `q` are not provided, we cannot compute a numerical value for `cost`. Therefore, the print statement will output the formula for `cost` based on the given conditions.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the formula: if n * m == k, then cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2); otherwise, cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * (k - (n - 1) * m))**
