Output State: **i must be less than or equal to d + 2 and the second element [1] of the popped element e must be less than or equal to i - (d + 2).**

In Natural Language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable `i` must be less than or equal to `d + 2`, and the second element of the tuple that is popped from the `min_heap` during each iteration must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. This condition ensures that the loop continues to execute as long as these criteria are met.
