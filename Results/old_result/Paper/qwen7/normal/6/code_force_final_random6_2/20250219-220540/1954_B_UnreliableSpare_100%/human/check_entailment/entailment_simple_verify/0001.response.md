### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Array Check**:
   - The `func_1` function checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If it is, it prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement. However, there is a flaw in the logic here. The current implementation of the `flag` check is unnecessary and can be simplified. The `flag` variable is set to `False` only if a non-uniform element is found, but since the problem guarantees that the array is beautiful, this check is redundant.

3. **Counting Operations**:
   - The function iterates through the array to count the maximum number of consecutive identical elements. This is used to determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the "beautiful" property. This part is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The edge case handling is mostly correct. If the array is already uniform, it correctly outputs `-1`. However, the logic for calculating the minimum number of removals needs to be re-evaluated. Specifically, the current logic calculates the minimum number of removals by finding the longest sequence of identical elements and subtracting this length from the total array length minus one. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the requirement to remove elements to break the "beautiful" property.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly outputs the minimum number of elements to remove or `-1` if it's impossible to break the "beautiful" property. However, the calculation of the minimum number of removals is incorrect as explained above.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Current Logic Flaw**:
  - The current logic assumes that the minimum number of removals needed is `n - max_consecutive_elements - 1`. This is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the array will no longer be "beautiful" after the removals. Instead, it should focus on breaking the pattern of consecutive identical elements.

- **Correct Approach**:
  - To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and then calculate the minimum number of removals needed to break this sequence. This can be done by identifying the longest sequence and then determining how many removals are needed to break this sequence.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Find the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements
    max_consecutive = 1
    current_consecutive = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            current_consecutive += 1
            max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)
        else:
            current_consecutive = 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of removals needed
    if max_consecutive == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(n - max_consecutive)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

### Final Evaluation:

- **Correctness**: The original assessment was partially correct but did not fully address the flaw in the logic for calculating the minimum number of removals. The corrected code addresses this flaw.
- **Final Decision**: Given the corrections made, the original assessment was inaccurate.

**Final: False**
