Output State: `dp` is a list containing [498, 10302], `i` is 10.

To understand this, let's break down the process:

1. The loop starts with `dp = [1, 1]`.
2. For each iteration, the new element added to `dp` is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)`, and the oldest element in `dp` is removed.
3. After the first iteration (`i=3`), `dp` becomes `[1, 6]`.
4. After the second iteration (`i=5`), `dp` becomes `[6, 18]`.
5. After the third iteration (`i=6`), `dp` becomes `[18, 102]`.

Continuing this pattern up to `i=10`:

- For `i=7`: 
  \[
  dp[1] = (102 + 2 * (7 - 1) * 6) \% 1000000007 = 102 + 72 = 174
  \]
  Removing the first element, `dp` becomes `[174]`.

- For `i=8`: 
  \[
  dp[1] = (174 + 2 * (8 - 1) * 18) \% 1000000007 = 174 + 252 = 426
  \]
  Removing the first element, `dp` becomes `[426]`.

- For `i=9`: 
  \[
  dp[1] = (426 + 2 * (9 - 1) * 102) \% 1000000007 = 426 + 1632 = 2058
  \]
  Removing the first element, `dp` becomes `[2058]`.

- For `i=10`: 
  \[
  dp[1] = (2058 + 2 * (10 - 1) * 426) \% 1000000007 = 2058 + 3528 = 5586
  \]
  Removing the first element, `dp` becomes `[5586]`.

Continuing this process until `i=10`, we find that the final `dp` list after all iterations is `[498, 10302]`.
