Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `h` is an integer from the input split by `':'` and its value is either greater than 12 or equal to 12.
- `m` is an integer from the input split by `'. '`.
- `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM'.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `h:02d` formats `h` to a zero-padded two-digit string. Since `h` is either 12 or greater than 12, it will be formatted correctly.
- `m:02d` formats `m` to a zero-padded two-digit string.
- `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM'.

Given these conditions, the output will be a string in the format `HH:MM AM/PM`.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}** (where `h` is an integer either 12 or greater, `m` is an integer, and `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM')
