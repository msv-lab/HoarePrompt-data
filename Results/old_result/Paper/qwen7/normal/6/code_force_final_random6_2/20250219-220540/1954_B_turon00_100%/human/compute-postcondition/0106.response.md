Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` retains its value from the last comparison, `cnt` is 0 if the last element in `a` did not match `tmp`, or it is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, `ans` is the minimum value between its initial value (`n`) and the highest count of consecutive elements that matched `tmp` found during the loop's execution, and neither `n` is equal to 1 nor `ans` is equal to `n`**
