Output State: **`l` is 3, `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`, `st` is 1**

The code `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Given that `st` was initially unspecified in the context of this problem, we assume it was 0 before this line of code was executed. After executing `st += 1`, the value of `st` becomes 1. The values of `l` and the relationship between `a[1]` and `a[2]` remain unchanged.
