Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 6, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. However, the initial values of `a[i]` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `r[a[i] - 1]`. But we know that `i` is `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 6. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as described above.
