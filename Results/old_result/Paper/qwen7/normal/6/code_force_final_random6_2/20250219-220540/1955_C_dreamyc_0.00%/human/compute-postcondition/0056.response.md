Output State: **`nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is at least 0, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `nums` is updated by appending `b` to itself.**

Explanation: The code `nums.append(b)` appends the last element of `nums` (which is `b`) back to `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
