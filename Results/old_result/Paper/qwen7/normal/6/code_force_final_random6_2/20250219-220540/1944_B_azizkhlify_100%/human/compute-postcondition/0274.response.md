Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `n` must be greater than 6; `l[a[n-1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 6, and the element in list `l` at the index `a[n-1] - 1` will have been incremented by 1 during the last iteration of the loop.
