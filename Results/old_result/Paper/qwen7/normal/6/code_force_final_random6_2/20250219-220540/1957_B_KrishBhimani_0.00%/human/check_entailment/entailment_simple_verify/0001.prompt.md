You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR:**
   - The program constructs a sequence of numbers based on the binary representation of `k`.
   - It iterates through the bits of `k` from least significant to most significant.
   - If the bit is set (i.e., `k & 1 == 1`), it appends the index of the bit to the list `arr`.
   - This effectively creates a list of indices corresponding to the positions of '1' bits in the binary representation of `k`.

3. **Constructing the Output Sequence:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the final sequence.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to keep track of how many elements have been added to `ans`.
   - It iterates through the list `arr` and appends `1 << i` (which is `2^i`) to `ans` until `c` reaches `n-1`.
   - After adding `n-1` elements, it calculates the remaining value needed to reach the sum `k` and appends it to `ans`.
   - Finally, it pads `ans` with zeros to ensure it has exactly `n` elements.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each one.

2. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR:**
   - The approach of using the binary representation of `k` to construct the sequence is sound. Each `1` bit in `k` corresponds to a power of 2, which ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have as many `1`s as possible.

3. **Sum Constraint:**
   - The program ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` by calculating the missing value after adding `n-1` elements.

4. **Padding with Zeros:**
   - The padding with zeros ensures that the sequence has exactly `n` elements, which is necessary for the problem constraints.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 1`, `k = 5`
  - Binary representation of `5` is `101` (bits at positions 0, 2).
  - The program generates `[4]` (since `1 << 2` is `4`).
  - Sum: `4`, which matches `k`.

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - Binary representation of `3` is `11` (bits at positions 0, 1).
  - The program generates `[1, 2]` (since `1 << 0` is `1` and `1 << 1` is `2`).
  - Sum: `1 + 2 = 3`, which matches `k`.
  - Bitwise OR: `1 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`).

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 6`, `k = 51`
  - Binary representation of `51` is `110011` (bits at positions 0, 2, 5).
  - The program generates `[32, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` (since `1 << 5` is `32`, `1 << 2` is `4`, and the rest are zeros).
  - Sum: `32 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 40`, which is close but not exact. The program should generate `[32, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]` to match the required sum and maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR.

### Conclusion:

The program is almost correct but fails to handle the exact sum constraint and maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR for some cases. Specifically, it needs to adjust the values to ensure the sum is exactly `k` while still maximizing the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR.
