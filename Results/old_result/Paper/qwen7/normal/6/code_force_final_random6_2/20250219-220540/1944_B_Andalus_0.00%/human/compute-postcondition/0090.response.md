Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 1`, `sng` must contain at least one element, and `k - sz` must be at least 1.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Initially, `sz` was equal to `k`. After executing the code, `sz` is now equal to `k + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
