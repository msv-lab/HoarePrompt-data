Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), along with 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each test case, it processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing specific parameters and a set of numbers. It processes these inputs to produce a result for each test case according to the defined conditions.
