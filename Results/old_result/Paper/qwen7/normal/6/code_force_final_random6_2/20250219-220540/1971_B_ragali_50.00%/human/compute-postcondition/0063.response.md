Output State: **`a` contains the element `i`, `i` is the next element in `s`.**

The code `a.add(i)` adds the element `i` to the set `a`. Since `a` did not contain any elements initially, after adding `i`, `a` now contains `i`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was just used as an argument to add to the set `a`.
