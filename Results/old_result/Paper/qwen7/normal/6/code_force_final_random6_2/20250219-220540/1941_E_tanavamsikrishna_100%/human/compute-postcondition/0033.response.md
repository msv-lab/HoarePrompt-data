Output State: **`i` is `2d + 3`, `min_heap` contains the tuple `e`, and each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 3` is updated to the original value plus `e[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `heappush(min_heap, e)` adds the tuple `e` to the `min_heap`. The initial state of `min_heap` being empty means that after executing this line, `min_heap` now contains the tuple `e`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged, so `i` is still `2d + 3`, and each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 3` is updated to the original value plus `e[0] + 1`.
