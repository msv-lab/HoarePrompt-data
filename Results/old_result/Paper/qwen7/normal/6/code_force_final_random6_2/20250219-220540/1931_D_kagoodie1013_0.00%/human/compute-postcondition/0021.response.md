Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `num` which is taken from the list `arr`. Therefore, the relevant variables are `num`, `arr`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `arr` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` was not empty, and now we need to determine the state for the next iteration.

3. **Update the State**:
   - **`arr`**: Since `num` is taken from `arr`, and the loop continues as long as `arr` is not empty, `arr` must still contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute again.
   - **`num`**: `num` is the second element of the tuple in `arr` that is currently being processed. For the next iteration, `num` will be the second element of the next tuple in `arr`.
   - **`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`**: These maps will be updated based on the new `num` value, but since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to update these maps yet. We just need to ensure they are in a valid state for the next iteration.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `arr` is a non-empty list of tuples.
- `num` is the second element of the first tuple in `arr` (since the current `num` was the second element of the previous tuple).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1, `mod_y_key` is updated to `num % y`, `count` is increased by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `arr` is a list of tuples that must not be empty, `num` is the second element of the first tuple in `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`, and `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1.**
