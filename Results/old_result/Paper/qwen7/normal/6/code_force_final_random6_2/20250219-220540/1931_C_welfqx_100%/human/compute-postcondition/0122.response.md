Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(n - 1)`. This means `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration.
   - The loop exits if `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is a list of integers.
   - `cn` is increased by 1 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is the length of the list `num`.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is exited if `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be within the bounds of the list (i.e., `i < n - 1`).
   - If `i` is within bounds, the loop continues; otherwise, it exits.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it is the length of the list `num`.
   - `cn` remains unchanged unless the condition `num[i] == num[i + 1]` is met in the next iteration.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num` is a list of integers, `cn` is increased by 1 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the length of the list `num`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`.**

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume the following values at the end of the previous iteration:
- `num = [1, 2, 2, 3]`
- `cn = 1`
- `i = 1`
- `n = 4`

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.
- The loop will check if `num[2] == num[3]` (i.e., `2 == 3`), which is false, so the loop will exit.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`num` is a list of integers, `cn` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is 4, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`.**
