You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers (where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50) and returns True if the list is already sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns False.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Operation Implementation:**
   - The program attempts to implement the operation by iterating through the array and checking if the current element is greater than the previous one and greater than 10.
   - If the condition is met, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - However, the implementation of the digit splitting and insertion is incorrect. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After attempting to apply the operation, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function, which simply compares the original array with its sorted version.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Digit Splitting and Insertion:**
   - The current implementation does not correctly split the element into its digits and insert them back into the array.
   - The logic inside the loop where it tries to split and insert digits is flawed and does not achieve the desired effect.

2. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The loop only checks if the current element is greater than the previous one and greater than 10, but it does not actually perform the necessary operations to transform the array into a sorted one.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, the program should:
1. Apply the operation of splitting elements into digits and inserting them back into the array until no more operations can be performed.
2. After applying the operation, check if the array is sorted.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the required operations and thus cannot be considered correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
