Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.
2. **Understand the loop head**: 
   - `heappop(min_heap)` pops the smallest element from the min heap and returns it as a tuple `(row[i], i)`.
   - The loop continues as long as the second element of this tuple (which is `i`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is `2d + 4`.
   - `min_heap` contains the tuple `(row[i], i)` where `i` is `2d + 4`.
   - Each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 4` is updated to the original value plus `e[0] + 1`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must be true.
   - Since `i` is `2d + 4`, the condition becomes `[e[1]] <= 2d + 4 - (d + 2)`, which simplifies to `e[1] <= d + 2`.
   - The tuple popped from the heap is `(row[i], i)`, and since `i` is `2d + 4`, `e[1]` is `2d + 4`.
   - Therefore, `2d + 4` must be less than or equal to `d + 2` for the loop to execute the first time, which is not possible unless there is some other state adjustment.

5. **Adjusting the state**:
   - The only way to satisfy the condition `e[1] <= d + 2` is to adjust the value of `i` such that when `heappop(min_heap)` is called, the second element of the tuple returned is less than or equal to `d + 2`.
   - This means that the value of `i` in the heap must be set to a value less than or equal to `d + 2`.

Given the current state and the requirement, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be less than or equal to `d + 2`**
