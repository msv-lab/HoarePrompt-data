Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to compute the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to infinity to keep track of the minimum cost.
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive), which means it starts from the last person in the queue and moves towards the front.
   - For each position `i`:
     - If `i < m`, it updates `pergunta` with the minimum value between the current `pergunta` and the accumulated cost `x` plus `a[i]`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x` to account for the cost of moving Kirill to the previous positions.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the minimum cost `pergunta` is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Initialization and Input Reading:** 
  - The program correctly initializes and reads the necessary inputs.
  
- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The logic inside `func_1` correctly accumulates the cost of moving Kirill to the front of the queue while ensuring he ends up within the first `m` positions.
  - The use of `min(a[i], b[i])` ensures that the cost is minimized at each step.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The loop runs from `n-1` to `0`, which covers all positions in the queue.
  - The condition `if i < m:` ensures that only the relevant positions are considered for updating the minimum cost.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which matches the problem requirement.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and verifying it against the problem description, the program appears to be correct and follows the specified logic accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
