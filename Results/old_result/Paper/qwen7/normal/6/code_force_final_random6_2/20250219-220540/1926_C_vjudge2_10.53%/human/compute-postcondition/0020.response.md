Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(10):` statement. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 10.

4. **Calculate the New Value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.

5. **Adjust the Other States**: The other states (`values` and `total`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Based on these steps, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

- `i` is 1
- `values` remains a list with elements [0, 0]
- `total` remains 0

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is 1, `values` is a list with elements [0, 0], `total` is 0**
