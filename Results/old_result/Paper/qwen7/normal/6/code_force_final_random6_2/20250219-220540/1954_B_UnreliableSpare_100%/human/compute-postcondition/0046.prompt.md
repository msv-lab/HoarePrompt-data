Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')`, `i` is `n-1`, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is `0`, the loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n-1`, the value of `n` must be greater than 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `arr[i]` must not be equal to `arr[i-1]`, the variable `flag` remains `False` throughout the entire loop execution.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == val:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is either incremented by 1 if the value at index `i` in `arr` equals `val`, or reset to 0 if it does not. Additionally, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is either incremented by 1 if the value at index `i` in `arr` equals `val`, or reset to 0 if it does not, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` retains its value, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `ans` retains its value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
