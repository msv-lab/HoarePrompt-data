Output State: **`a` is the original string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is the total count of occurrences where the substring `s` (of length 3) starting from index `i` is either 'map' or 'pie', `i` is incremented by 1, and `s` is the new substring starting from the new value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`a`, `ans`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
