Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `re` is `re_prev + 2`, `res` contains the element `a[i]`**.

This means that the variable `res` has had its list appended with the element `a[i]`, while the conditions and values of `n`, `i`, and `re` remain unchanged from their initial states.
