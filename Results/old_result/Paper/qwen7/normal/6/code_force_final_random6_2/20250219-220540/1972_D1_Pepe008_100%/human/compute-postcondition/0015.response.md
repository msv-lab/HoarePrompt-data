Postcondition: `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `b` must be at least 1, and `suma` is increased by 1 if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are true, then no change is made to `b`. Otherwise, the condition remains as initially stated.
