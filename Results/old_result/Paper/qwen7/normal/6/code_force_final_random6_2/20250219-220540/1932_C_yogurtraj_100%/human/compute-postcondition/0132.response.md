Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is 2, `y[i]` is `k`, `q1` is 1 if `t[i] == 'R'` is true, otherwise `q1` is 0, and `q2` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `y[i] = k` assigns the value of `k` to the index `i` in the list `y`. Given the initial state, `i` is -1, so `y[i]` is now `k`. The other variables (`n`, `q1`, and `q2`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.
