Output State: `i` is 200000, `k` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from 99999 to 199999.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 200000 (since it starts at 99999 and increments by 1 for each iteration up to 100000 iterations). The variable `k` must be at least 100000 for the loop to run that many times. The variable `s` will hold the cumulative sum of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each value of `i` from 99999 to 199999, inclusive.
