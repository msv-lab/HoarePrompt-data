### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that both strings `a` and `b` match the template, but `c` does not.
   - A template `t` is a string where each character can be either lowercase or uppercase.
   - If a character in `t` is lowercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must match.
   - If a character in `t` is uppercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must not match the lowercase version of that character.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if there is any position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not equal `c[i]`.
   - If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - This function only checks if `a` and `b` can potentially match the same template as `c` does not, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` can indeed match a template while `c` cannot.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Checking the Logic of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is incomplete because it only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` can differ from `c[i]`, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` can match a template while `c` cannot.
   - For example, consider the test case:
     ```
     4
     2
     aa
     bb
     aa
     ```
     Here, `a` and `b` are both "aa", and `c` is also "aa". According to the problem statement, `a` and `b` should match a template, and `c` should not. However, `func_1` will return 'NO' because `a` and `b` do not differ from `c`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to check if there exists a template where `a` and `b` can match but `c` cannot.
   - One way to do this is to compare each character of `a` and `b` with `c` and ensure that for each position, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`, then a template can be constructed.

6. **Evaluation Based on Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not fully satisfy the conditions required by the problem. It only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` can differ from `c[i]`, which is insufficient.
   - The annotated code also correctly identifies that the function `func_2` reads the input and processes it correctly, but the core logic in `func_1` is flawed.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation in `func_1` is incorrect because it does not fully satisfy the conditions required by the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not properly check if `a` and `b` can match a template while `c` cannot.
