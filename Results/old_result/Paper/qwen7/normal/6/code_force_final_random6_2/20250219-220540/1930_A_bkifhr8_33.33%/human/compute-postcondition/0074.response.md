Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `ans_f` contains the last calculated `ans`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `l = input()` assigns the value of the input string to the variable `l`. The values of `i`, `ans_f`, `ans`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
