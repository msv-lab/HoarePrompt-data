Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is `n-1`; `ans[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans[i] = 1` changes the value of `ans[i]` from its previous value to 1. Since `i` is `n-1`, `ans[n-1]` is updated to 1. All other values in the list `ans` remain unchanged.
