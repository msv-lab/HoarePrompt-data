Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:

for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.

    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `a` and `b` are lists of the same length where, for each index `i`:
    #
    #- If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, the element at index `i` in `a` is the maximum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`, and the element at index `i` in `b` is the minimum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`.
    #- If `i` is greater than half the length of `a` minus one, the element at index `i` in `a` is the minimum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`, and the element at index `i` in `b` is the maximum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the first half of the lists `a` and `b` will have their elements swapped such that the larger of the two values is in `a` and the smaller in `b`. The second half of the lists will have their elements swapped such that the smaller of the two values is in `a` and the larger in `b`.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `a` and `b` are lists of the same length where, for each index `i`:
    #- If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, the element at index `i` in `a` is the maximum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`, and the element at index `i` in `b` is the minimum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`.

    #
    #This means that the first half of the lists `a` and `b` will have their elements swapped such that the larger of the two values is in `a` and the smaller in `b`. The second half of the lists will have their elements swapped such that the smaller of the two values is in `a` and the larger in `b`.
    print()
    #This is printed: ''
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: `i` is 3, `b` is a list that must have at least 3 elements.
    print()
    #This is printed: None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads two strings of equal length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9, and modifies them in place. For the first half of the strings, it ensures that the larger digit is placed in the first string (`a`) and the smaller in the second string (`b`). For the second half, it does the opposite, placing the smaller digit in `a` and the larger in `b`. Finally, it prints the modified strings `a` and `b` to the console.
