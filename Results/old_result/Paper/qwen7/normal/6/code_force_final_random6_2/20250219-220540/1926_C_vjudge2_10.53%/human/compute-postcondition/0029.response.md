Output State: **i is 9; values is a list with elements [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; total is 45; sum_values is a list with elements [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45].**

Explanation: After executing the loop 10 times (from `i=0` to `i=9`), the variable `i` will be 9. The `values` list will contain integers from 0 to 9 because `values[i]` is set to `i` in each iteration. The `total` variable accumulates the sum of integers from 0 to 9, which is 45. The `sum_values` list will store the cumulative sums up to each index, resulting in the sequence of triangular numbers: [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45].
