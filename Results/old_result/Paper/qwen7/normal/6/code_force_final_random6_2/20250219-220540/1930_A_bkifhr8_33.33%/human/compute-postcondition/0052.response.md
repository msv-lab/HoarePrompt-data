Postcondition: `i` is 1 and less than `n * 2`. If `lst` has a length not equal to 2, then `lst` has been modified by removing its element at index 2, and `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers. If `lst` has a length equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
