The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is now \(t-1\) because each iteration decrements `t` by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list containing the element `n`**
