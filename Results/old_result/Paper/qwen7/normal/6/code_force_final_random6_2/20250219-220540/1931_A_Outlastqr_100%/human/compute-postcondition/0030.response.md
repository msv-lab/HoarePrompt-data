Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an input integer, `word` is a string containing the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 28` followed by 'az', `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` appends the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 28` followed by 'az' to the existing value of `word`. Given the conditions for `word` in the initial state, the new value of `word` will be the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 28` followed by 'az'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
