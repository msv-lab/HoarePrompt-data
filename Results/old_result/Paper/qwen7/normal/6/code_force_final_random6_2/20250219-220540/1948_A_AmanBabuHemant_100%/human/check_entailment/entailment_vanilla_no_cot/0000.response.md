Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases as specified in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Odd `n` Values**: The program correctly prints "NO" when `n` is odd since it cannot form a string with exactly `n` special characters. This part is correct.
   
2. **Even `n` Values**: For even `n`, the program attempts to construct a string using `'AAB' * (n // 2)` to ensure that every character except the first and last one has exactly one neighbor that matches it. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting string will have exactly `n` special characters. For example, for `n=4`, the constructed string would be `"AABAAABB"`, which has 4 special characters but does not meet the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters in a more optimal way.

To correct this, we need to ensure that the constructed string meets the exact requirement of having exactly `n` special characters. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Construct a string with exactly n special characters
            s = 'A' + 'B' * (n - 1) + 'A'
            if len(s) <= 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected program constructs a string where every character except the first and last one is a special character, ensuring that the number of special characters is exactly `n`. This meets the problem requirements.
