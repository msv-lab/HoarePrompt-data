Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n`, and `s` is updated to the input string.**

The code `s = input()` reads an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `s` is updated to the input string provided by the user, which consists of '+' and '-' characters and has a length equal to `n`.
