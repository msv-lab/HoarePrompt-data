Output State: **`ans` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and `c` remains either '0' or '?'.**

Explanation: The line `ans = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. Since `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` from the final iteration, `ans` now also contains these same elements. The variable `c` remains unchanged and still holds either '0' or '?'.
