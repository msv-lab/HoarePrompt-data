Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
   - `i` is the first character in the string `s`.
   - If `i` is '-', then `neg` is 1; otherwise, the values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using the variable `i`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The loop head involves the variables `i` and `s`.
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, `i` will move to the next character in the string.
   - The string `s` itself does not change within the loop head (it is only accessed, not modified).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `i` was set to the first character of `s`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should now be set to the second character of `s`.
   - The string `s` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Post-Iteration State**:
   - `s` remains a non-empty string consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
   - `i` is now the second character in the string `s`.
   - If the new `i` is '-', then `neg` is 1; otherwise, the values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, and if `i` is '-', then `neg` is 1; otherwise, the values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged.**
