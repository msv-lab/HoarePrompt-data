Output State: **`idx` is increased by 1; `v[x]` is increased by 1; `x` is an integer from `data[idx]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` to `x`. Since `data[idx]` is an integer, `x` becomes that integer. The values of `idx` and `v[x]` are updated according to the initial state. The updated values are reflected in the output state.
