Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `first` is either `False` if `mpp[1]` is 1, or it remains unchanged if `mpp[1]` is not 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is encountered, it means we exit the loop or conditional block without further changes to the variables `i`, `n`, and `first`. Therefore, their states remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
