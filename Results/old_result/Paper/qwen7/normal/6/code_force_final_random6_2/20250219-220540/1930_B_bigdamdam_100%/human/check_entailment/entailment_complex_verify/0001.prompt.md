You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: `ind` is `n + 1`; `i` is `n - 1`; `p` is a list where every even index is filled with the value `1 + 2 * ((index - 1) // 2)` and every odd index is filled with the value `1 + 2 * ((index) // 2)` if `index` is less than `n` and `0` otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \). It constructs a list \( p \) of length \( n \), where every even index is filled with the value \( 1 + 2 \times \left(\frac{\text{index} - 1}{2}\right) \) and every odd index is filled with the value \( 1 + 2 \times \left(\frac{\text{index}}{2}\right) \) if the index is less than \( n \) and 0 otherwise. After processing all test cases, it prints the list \( p \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program constructs a list `p` of length `n` initialized with zeros.
   - It uses two separate loops to fill the list `p`:
     - The first loop fills even indices starting from the highest possible value (`ind = n`) down to 1, decrementing by 2 each time.
     - The second loop fills odd indices starting from the next available value after the last filled even index (`ind = 1 + n % 2`), incrementing by 2 each time.

3. **Validation**:
   - The problem requires that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) should exist such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).
   - Let's check if the constructed permutation satisfies this condition:
     - Even indices are filled with values in descending order: \(n, n-2, n-4, \ldots\)
     - Odd indices are filled with values in ascending order: \(1 + n \% 2, 3 + n \% 2, 5 + n \% 2, \ldots\)
     - This ensures that no even index value will divide any odd index value because the even values are strictly decreasing and the odd values are strictly increasing.

4. **Examples**:
   - For \(n = 4\):
     - Constructed permutation: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`
     - Check: No pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) exists where \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).
   - For \(n = 3\):
     - Constructed permutations: `[3, 1, 2]` or `[1, 3, 2]`
     - Check: Both permutations satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program constructs a permutation that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
