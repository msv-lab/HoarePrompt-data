Output State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is the sum of its previous value and `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.**

This means that the number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) has been incremented by the value of `tickets_to_buy`, which is determined as the minimum between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. The `total_cost` remains as it was initially increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`.
