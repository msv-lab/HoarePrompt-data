Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `i` is 3, `a` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx2` is the value of `last[2]`, `inx` remains unchanged, and if `inx < 0`, then `inx` remains unchanged, and we continue the loop or block we were inside.**

The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values but instead moves the control to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.
