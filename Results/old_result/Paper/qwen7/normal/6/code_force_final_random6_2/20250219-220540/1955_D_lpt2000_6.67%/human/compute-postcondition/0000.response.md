Output State: **`nabors` is an input integer, and all other variables (t, n, m, k, a, b) retain their initial states.**

Explanation: The code `nabors = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. The initial states of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, `nabors` is updated to the input integer, while `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` retain their unspecified but valid initial conditions.
