Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the given information, `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - The loop will iterate over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will decrement from `n-1` to `0`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will start with `i` being `n-1`, the loop will execute until `i` reaches 0.
   - Therefore, the initial state of `i` should be `n-1` and `n` should be greater than 1 (as mentioned in the problem statement).

5. **Final state after the loop**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be 0 (since the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to 0).
   - The value of `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to have executed properly.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1**
