### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game.

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The code correctly parses the input values for \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \).
   - It also correctly converts the permutation and array into zero-based indices by subtracting 1 from each element.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position \( s \) over \( k \) turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx`, `cur`, and `vis` to keep track of the maximum score, the current score, and whether a position has been visited, respectively.
   - The loop continues as long as the current position \( s \) has not been visited and there are turns left (\( k > 0 \)).
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position as visited.
     - Updates the maximum score (`mx`) considering the current score plus the remaining turns multiplied by the value at the current position.
     - Adds the value at the current position to the current score.
     - Decrements the number of turns left.
     - Moves to the next position according to the permutation.
   - After the loop, it returns the maximum score calculated.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main part of the code calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

Given the detailed analysis, the code seems to correctly implement the logic for calculating the maximum possible score for each player and determining the winner based on these scores.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **True**
