Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is equal to `t`.
- `n` is 0.
- `m` is an input integer and is even.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `k` is not a power of two.

The print statement is `print(2)`. This statement directly prints the integer 2 without referencing any of the other variables.

Output: **2**
