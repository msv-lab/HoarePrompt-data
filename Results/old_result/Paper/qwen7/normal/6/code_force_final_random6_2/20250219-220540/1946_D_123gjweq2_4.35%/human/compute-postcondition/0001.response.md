Output State: **The program returns 0**

Given the initial state, `bit` is -1, which means it does not meet the condition `0 <= bit < 30`. Therefore, the code simply returns the length of `cur_arr`. Since no specific value for `cur_arr` is given other than it being a list of non-negative integers, and no modification to `cur_arr` is mentioned, we consider its length as it was initially, which is 0 if no elements were specified. Thus, the program returns 0.
