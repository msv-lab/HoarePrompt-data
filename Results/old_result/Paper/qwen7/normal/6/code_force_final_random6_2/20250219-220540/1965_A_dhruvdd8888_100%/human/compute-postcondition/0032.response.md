Output State: **`cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` is equal to 1, and `True` if `nums[i]` is not equal to 1; `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`; `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0'; `i` is `len(nums) - 3`; `nw` is `cw`.**

Explanation: The code `nw = cw` assigns the current value of `cw` to `nw`. Since `cw` was defined based on the condition of `nums[i]` being 1 or not, this condition remains unchanged. All other variables (`ls`, `nums`, `i`, and `nw`) are updated such that `nw` now holds the same value as `cw`.
