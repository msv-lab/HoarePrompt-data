Output State: **`position` is 4, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\)**

The value of `position` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
