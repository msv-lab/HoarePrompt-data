Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. Instead, it checks for consecutive equal elements and calculates the cost based on the length of such sequences, which is not always the optimal solution.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to identify the minimum cost to make all elements equal by considering the unique values in the array and determining the best segment to apply the operation to. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = {}
    for num in arr:
        if num in freq:
            freq[num] += 1
        else:
            freq[num] = 1
    
    # Find the element with the maximum frequency
    max_freq = max(freq.values())
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for num in freq:
        if freq[num] == max_freq:
            # Calculate the cost of making all elements equal to this number
            cost = len(arr) - max_freq
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    return min_cost

# The rest of the code remains the same
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1
```

This corrected function first counts the frequency of each element in the array. Then, it finds the element(s) with the highest frequency and calculates the cost of making all elements equal to that element. This approach ensures that the solution is optimal.
