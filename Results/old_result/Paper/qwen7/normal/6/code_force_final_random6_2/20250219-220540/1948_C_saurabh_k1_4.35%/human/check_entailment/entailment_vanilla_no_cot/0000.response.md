Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program only checks the second-to-last column (`b[n-2]`) and prints 'No' if the arrow is `<`. This is insufficient because the robot needs to navigate through the entire grid, not just check one column.

2. **Movement Logic**: The program does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid according to the arrows. It simply checks one condition and makes a decision based on that.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle scenarios where the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) through valid movements. For example, in the fourth test case, the robot can navigate through multiple arrows to reach the target.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step through the grid, considering both the initial position and the direction of each arrow. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        row = 1
        col = 1
        
        while col <= n:
            if row == 1:
                if a[col - 1] == '<':
                    col -= 1
                else:
                    col += 1
                    row = 2
            elif row == 2:
                if b[col - 1] == '<':
                    col -= 1
                else:
                    col += 1
                    row = 1
        
        if col == n and row == 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version simulates the robot's movement through the grid, checking the direction of each arrow and updating the robot's position accordingly. It ensures that the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) by navigating through the grid correctly.
