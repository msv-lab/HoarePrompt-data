Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is still 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are now the integers obtained from the input split.
