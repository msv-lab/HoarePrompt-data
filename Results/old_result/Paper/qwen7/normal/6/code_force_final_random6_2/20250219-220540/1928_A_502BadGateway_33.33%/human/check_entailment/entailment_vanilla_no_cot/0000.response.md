Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed. According to the problem statement, a rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles, and those smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. 

The correct approach would involve checking if either dimension can be split in such a way that the resulting pieces can form a new unique rectangle. The current implementation fails to consider this logic. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    # If both dimensions are equal, no new rectangle can be formed
    if a == b:
        return 'No'
    # If one dimension is 1, no new rectangle can be formed
    elif min(a, b) == 1:
        return 'No'
    # Otherwise, a new rectangle can always be formed
    else:
        return 'Yes'
```

This function correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the logic aligns with the problem description.
