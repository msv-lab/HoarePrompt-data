Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The line of code `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`. Since the initial values of `c` and `maxi` are not specified, the updated value of `maxi` is simply the maximum of these two values. No other variables are affected by this operation.
