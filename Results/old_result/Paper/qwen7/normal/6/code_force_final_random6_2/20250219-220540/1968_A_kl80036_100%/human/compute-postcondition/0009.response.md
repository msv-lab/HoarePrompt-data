Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `y` is `x - 1`**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and still holds the value 2. The variable `y` is updated to be `x - 1` because `x` has now been reassigned. The initial value of `x` being an integer between 1 and 1000 is preserved, and `y` is recalculated based on the new value of `x`.
