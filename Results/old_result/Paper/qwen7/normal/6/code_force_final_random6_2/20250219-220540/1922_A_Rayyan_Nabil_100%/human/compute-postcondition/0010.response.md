Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input().strip())` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer. The original values of `results` and `c` remain unchanged, and `t` must still be greater than 0.
