Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, after executing this line of code, `t` retains its value as an integer within this range. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
