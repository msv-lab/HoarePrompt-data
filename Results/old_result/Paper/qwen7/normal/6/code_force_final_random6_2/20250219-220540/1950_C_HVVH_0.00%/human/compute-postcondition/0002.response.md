Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the following variables: `_` (a dummy variable used as the loop counter) and `n` (the number of iterations).

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - The variable `_` is a dummy variable and its initial value is not relevant since it is incremented within the loop.
   - The variable `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
   - The initial values of `t` and `day` do not affect the loop execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
