Output State: **`h` is an integer converted from the first part of the input split by ':', `m` is an integer converted from the second part of the input split by ',', `day` is 'AM'**.

The code changes the value of `day` from 'PM' to 'AM'. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `h` and `m` retain their initial values, and `day` is updated to 'AM'.
