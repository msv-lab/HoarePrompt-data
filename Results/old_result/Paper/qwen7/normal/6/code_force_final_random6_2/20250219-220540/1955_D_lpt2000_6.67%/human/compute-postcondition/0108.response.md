Output State: **Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must contain at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element, and `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. Additionally, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0 initially, then `D[out_aa]` is now 0, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. `C[in_aa]` is now equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `C[in_aa] += 1` increments the value of `C[in_aa]` by 1. Since the initial postconditions are still valid and no other changes were made to the other variables, these conditions remain unchanged except for the increment of `C[in_aa]`.
