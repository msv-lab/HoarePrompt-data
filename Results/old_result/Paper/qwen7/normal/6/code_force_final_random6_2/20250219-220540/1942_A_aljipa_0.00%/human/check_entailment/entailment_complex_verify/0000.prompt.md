You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0, as it starts from a value between 1 and \(10^3\) and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. For each iteration, `n` and `k` will be input integers that determine the value of `res`. The value of `res` will depend on the conditions: if `k == n`, then `res` will be `[1] * n`; if `k == 1`, then `res` will be `range(n)`; otherwise, `res` will be `[-1]`.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `t` will be 0, and `res` will be determined by the last values of `n` and `k` entered by the user, following the specified conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(n\) and \(k\). Based on the values of \(n\) and \(k\), it generates a list `res` with specific configurations: if \(k = n\), `res` is a list of \(n\) ones; if \(k = 1\), `res` is a range of integers from 0 to \(n-1\); otherwise, `res` is a list containing a single `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the list `res` for each test case and sets the counter `t` to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always generates either an array of ones if `k` equals `n`, an array of consecutive integers if `k` equals `1`, or `-1` otherwise. However, this approach does not guarantee that exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts will be sorted for all values of `n` and `k`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The program would generate the array `[1, 2, 3]`, but this array has only one sorted cyclic shift (`[1, 2, 3]`), not two. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement for this specific case.
