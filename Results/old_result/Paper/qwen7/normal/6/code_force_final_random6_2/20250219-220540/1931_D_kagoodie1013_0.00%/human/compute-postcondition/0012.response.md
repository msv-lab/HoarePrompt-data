Output State: **`count` is increased by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `arr` is a list of tuples that must not be empty, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` by 1. The value of `mod_y_key` is `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
