Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range of the length of `arr`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `arr` is a non-empty list.
   - `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum possible value starting from the first element of `arr`.
   - `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, the next value of `i` will be 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1.
   - The list `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body (based on the given postconditions).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was 0, it becomes 1; if `i` was 1, it becomes 2.
   - `arr` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum possible value starting from the first element of `arr`, and `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative**.
