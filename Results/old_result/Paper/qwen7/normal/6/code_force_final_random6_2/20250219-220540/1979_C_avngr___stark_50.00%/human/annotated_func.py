#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; k_i is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the list `numbers`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `hcf` will hold the greatest common divisor of all the elements in the list `numbers`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `hcf` to be the gcd of its current value and each subsequent element in `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the list. Given a list of positive integers, the function calculates and returns their greatest common divisor.
