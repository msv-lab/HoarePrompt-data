Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list that may contain either ['max_segment + [i]' or ['new_segment', 'i'], `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]`, `max_sum` remains -1, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `new_segment` variable to a list containing `arr[i]` and `i`. All other variables remain in their initial states.
