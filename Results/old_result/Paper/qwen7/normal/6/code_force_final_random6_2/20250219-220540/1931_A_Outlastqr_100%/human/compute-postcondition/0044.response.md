Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `word` is a string 'az', `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The code appends the characters `'a'`, the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28`, and `'z'` to the string `word`. Given the initial state, `n` is an integer, and assuming `alphabet` is a list of lowercase English letters (26 letters), `n - 28` would be out of bounds if `n` is less than or equal to 2. However, since no specific value for `n` is given and the problem states that `n` is an integer, we consider the general case where `n` is within a valid range such that `n - 28` is a valid index. For simplicity, if `n` is 29, the character at index `1` (considering 0-based indexing) would be `'b'`. But without a specific `n`, we can only say that `word` becomes `'az'`. The other variables remain unchanged.
