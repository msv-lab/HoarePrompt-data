Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `nums`.

2. **Deque Usage**:
   - The program uses a `deque` to efficiently pop from both ends.
   - This is appropriate since we need to remove elements from both the start and end of the list during each attack cycle.

3. **Attack Logic**:
   - The program enters a loop where it performs attacks until `k` attacks are completed or there are fewer than 2 ships left.
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements (`a` and `b`) and reduces them by the minimum value between `a` and `b`.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the minimum value, it reduces both `a` and `b` by this minimum value and decrements `k` accordingly.
   - If `k` is less than twice the minimum value, the loop breaks.
   - After each reduction, it checks if the reduced values are still positive. If they are, it appends them back to the `deque`. If they are not, it increments the answer counter `ans`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After exiting the loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is still sufficient to sink it, the program increments `ans` by 1.
   - Finally, it returns the total count of sunk ships.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program using the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 4`, `k = 5`, `nums = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
- Expected Output: `2`

1. Initial state: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`
2. First attack: `[2, 4, 3]` (1 and 3 are sunk)
3. Second attack: `[2, 4, 2]` (last 3 is sunk)
4. Third attack: `[1, 4, 2]` (first 2 is sunk)
5. Fourth attack: `[1, 4, 1]` (first 2 is sunk)
6. Fifth attack: `[4, 1]` (first 1 is sunk)

Sunk ships: 2 (1, 3, 2, 2, 1)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n = 4`, `k = 6`, `nums = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
- Expected Output: `3`

1. Initial state: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`
2. First attack: `[2, 4, 3]` (1 is sunk)
3. Second attack: `[2, 4, 2]` (last 3 is sunk)
4. Third attack: `[2, 4, 2]` (first 2 is sunk)
5. Fourth attack: `[1, 4, 2]` (first 2 is sunk)
6. Fifth attack: `[1, 4, 1]` (first 1 is sunk)
7. Sixth attack: `[4, 1]` (first 1 is sunk)

Sunk ships: 3 (1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1)

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the logic of attacking the ships and counting the sunk ones. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
