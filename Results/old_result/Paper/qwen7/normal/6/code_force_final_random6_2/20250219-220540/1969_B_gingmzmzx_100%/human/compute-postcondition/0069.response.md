Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for c in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `c` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body Effects**:
   - `c` is set to the first element of `s`.
   - `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.
   - `ans` is updated based on the conditions given.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `c` is the first element of `s`.
   - `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.
   - `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0 and `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is incremented by the difference between the number of zeroes (`zeroes`) and the count of `0` (`cnt[0]`).

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element of `s`, the next value of `c` will be the next element in `s`.
   - The variable `s` itself does not change within the loop, only `c` changes.
   - `cnt[c]` will be incremented by 1 for the next element `c`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `c` will be the next element in `s`.
   - `cnt[c]` will be incremented by 1.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `c` and the updated `cnt[c]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in `s` being assigned to `c`, and `cnt[c]` being incremented by 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`c` is the next element in `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1**.
