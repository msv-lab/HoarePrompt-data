Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string from the user, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `a.split()` to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `b`, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split(), `f` is the second element of the list `b`, `k` is the third element of the list `b`, and if `k` is equal to `n`, the condition holds true.
