Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i - 1]'` or `['new_segment', 'i - 1']`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i-1]`**.

This means that the first element of `max_segment` (which was previously unspecified) is now increased by the value of `arr[i-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
