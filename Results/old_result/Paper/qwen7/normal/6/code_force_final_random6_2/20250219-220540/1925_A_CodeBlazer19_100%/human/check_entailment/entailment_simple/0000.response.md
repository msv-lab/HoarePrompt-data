### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to generate a string \( s \) such that every possible string of length \( n \) that can be formed using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets is a subsequence of \( s \). The string \( s \) should be the shortest possible.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution generates a string consisting of the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets repeated \( n \) times.
   - This approach ensures that every possible string of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) alphabets is a subsequence of \( s \), because every character combination can be found in the repeated sequence.

3. **Verification**:
   - For example, if \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the generated string would be "abab". This string contains both "aa" and "ab" as subsequences.
   - The solution handles the constraints correctly, as it repeats the sequence of \( k \) characters exactly \( n \) times.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( k = 1 \), the solution still works as it generates a string of length \( n \) where every character is the same, which trivially contains all possible strings of length \( n \) (which are just the character repeated \( n \) times).
   - The solution also handles larger values of \( n \) and \( k \) within the specified limits (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ 26).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution meets the requirements of the problem and generates the correct output for all given constraints.
