Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `PB` is updated to the integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 24`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is updated to the integer from `data[index + 3]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1`, `p` is updated to a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by 4.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `p` by converting the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers using `map(int, ...)`. This means `p` now holds these new integer values.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states as described in the initial state.
