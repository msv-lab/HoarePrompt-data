Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'.
3. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
4. It then compares these counts and prints 'A' if there are more 'A's, otherwise it prints 'B'.
5. The logic and flow of the program match the problem description and the expected behavior.
6. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code that would cause incorrect results.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the provided problem description and the execution states.

Correctness: **True**
