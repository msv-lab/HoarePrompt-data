Output State: **`count` is 0, `arr` is a non-empty list, `num` is the first element in the list, `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x`. Since `num` is the first element in the list `arr`, `mod_x` is computed using the modulus operation with `-num` and `x`. The values of `count` and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `mod_y_map` remains an empty dictionary as no operations were performed on it.
