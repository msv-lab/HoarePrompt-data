Output State: **`cou` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than -1.**

The code `cou += 1` increments the value of `cou` by 1. Given that the initial postcondition was `cou` remains 0, after executing this line, `cou` becomes 1. The other conditions and variables (`i` being incremented by 1 and `n` still being greater than -1) remain unchanged from their initial postconditions.
