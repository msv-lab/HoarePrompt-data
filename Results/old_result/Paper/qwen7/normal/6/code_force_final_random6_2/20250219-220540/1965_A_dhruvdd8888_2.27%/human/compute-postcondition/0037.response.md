Output State: **The program prints 'Alice'**

The code snippet provided does not perform any calculation or modification to the existing variables. Instead, it directly calls the `print` function to output the string 'Alice'. Since no return statement is present, the function does not return any value but simply prints 'Alice' to the console.
