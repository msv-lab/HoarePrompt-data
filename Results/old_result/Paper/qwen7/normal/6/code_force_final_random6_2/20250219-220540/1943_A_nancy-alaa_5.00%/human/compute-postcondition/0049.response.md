Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `first` is False, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`**.

Explanation: The line `first = False` changes the value of the variable `first` from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
