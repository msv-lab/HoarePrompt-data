Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 5.
- `ansv` contains the elements `subseq_lens[2]`, `subseq_lens[3]`, and `subseq_lens[4]`.

Given that `subseq_lens` is a list with elements `[10, 10, 10]`, the elements of `ansv` after the loop will be `[10, 10, 10]`.

The code snippet `print(len(ansv))` will print the length of the list `ansv`.

Therefore, the output will be the length of the list `ansv`, which contains 3 elements.

Output: **3**
