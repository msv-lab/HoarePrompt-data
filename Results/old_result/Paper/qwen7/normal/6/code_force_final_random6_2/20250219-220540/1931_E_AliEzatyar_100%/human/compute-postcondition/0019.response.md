Output State: **The program returns the count of '0's from the last index of `num` to the first index where a non-zero digit is encountered, or the length of `num` if no non-zero digit is found.**

This means the program will count how many zeros are there from the end of the number (as represented by the list `num`) until it finds a non-zero digit, or it will return the total length of the list `num` if there are no non-zero digits at all.
