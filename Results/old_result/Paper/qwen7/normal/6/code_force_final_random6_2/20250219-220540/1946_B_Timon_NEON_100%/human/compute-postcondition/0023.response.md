Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is [arr[i], i], `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1**

Explanation: The code assigns `[arr[i], i]` to `new_segment`. This means that `new_segment` now contains the current value of `arr[i]` and the index `i`. The other variables (`segments_variants`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
