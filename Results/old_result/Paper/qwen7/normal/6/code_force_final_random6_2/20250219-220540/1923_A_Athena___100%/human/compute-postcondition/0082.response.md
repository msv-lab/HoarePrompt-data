Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`. This means the loop will continue as long as `a` is non-empty and the first element of `a` is `0`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is that `a` is non-empty and the first element of `a` is the second element of the original list `a`.

3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
   - `a` must still be non-empty.
   - The first element of `a` must still be `0`.

4. **Adjusting States**: 
   - Since the loop condition requires `a` to be non-empty, `a` must remain non-empty for the loop to execute again.
   - The first element of `a` must be `0` for the loop to continue.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again**: To ensure the loop executes again, we need to maintain the condition that `a` is non-empty and the first element of `a` is `0`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `a` must be non-empty and the first element of `a` must be `0`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is non-empty and the first element of `a` is 0**
