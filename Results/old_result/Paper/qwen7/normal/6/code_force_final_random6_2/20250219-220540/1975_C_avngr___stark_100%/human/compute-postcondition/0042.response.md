Output State: **`temp` is [0, 3, 1], `i` is 0, `n` is 3, `n - 2` is 1**

Explanation: The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 0) to `i + 3` (which is 3). Given the initial state, `a` is implied to be `[i, n, n - 2]` or `[0, 3, 1]`. Therefore, `temp` is assigned the slice `[0, 3, 1]`. The other variables `i`, `n`, and `n - 2` remain unchanged.
