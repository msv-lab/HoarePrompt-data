Output State: `beg` is equal to `end`, and `mid` is equal to `beg`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the condition `beg < end` will no longer be true, which means the loop terminates. At this point, `beg` will be equal to `end` because the loop continues to adjust `beg` and `end` until they converge. The value of `mid` will also be equal to `beg` (or `end`) since `mid` is recalculated using the current values of `beg` and `end` in each iteration.
