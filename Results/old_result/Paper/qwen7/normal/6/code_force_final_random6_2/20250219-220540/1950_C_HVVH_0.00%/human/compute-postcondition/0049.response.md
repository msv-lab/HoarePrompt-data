Postcondition: `h` is an integer and `m` is an integer. If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12, `m` retains its original value, and `day` remains 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, then `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, then `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is not 12 and not 0, then `h` and `m` retain their original values, and `day` remains 'AM'.
