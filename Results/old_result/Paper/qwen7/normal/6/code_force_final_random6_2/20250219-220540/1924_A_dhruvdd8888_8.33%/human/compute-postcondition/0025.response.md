Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. The variables involved here are `i`, `s`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `win` is a set containing the element `i`.
   - `s` is the original string.
   - `us` is unchanged.
   - `ans` is unchanged.
   - `ps` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `us` and `len(win)` equals `k`, otherwise `ps` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i`: This variable will take the next character from the string `s` in the next iteration.
   - `s`: The string `s` remains unchanged as it is the original string and does not change within the loop.

4. **Conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` should be a valid character in the string `s`.
   - The conditions for incrementing `ps` (i.e., `i` is in `us` and `len(win)` equals `k`) do not affect the loop continuation directly but will be checked during the loop execution.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be the next character from the string `s`.
- `s` remains the original string.
- `win`, `us`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged until the loop body is executed.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`win` is a set containing the element `i`, `s` is the original string, `us` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, and `ps` is unchanged.**
