Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

Let's analyze why:

1. **Odd and Even Indices Handling**: The code assigns even indices with decreasing values starting from \( n \) and odd indices with increasing values starting from 1. This approach does not guarantee that the divisibility condition will not hold for any pair \( (i, j) \).

2. **Divisibility Condition**: Consider the example given in the problem statement:
   - For \( n = 4 \), the generated permutation might be `[4, 3, 2, 1]`. Here, \( p_1 = 4 \) divides \( p_3 = 2 \) and \( p_2 = 3 \) divides \( p_4 = 1 \), which violates the condition.
   - For \( n = 3 \), the generated permutation might be `[3, 2, 1]`. Here, \( p_1 = 3 \) divides \( p_3 = 1 \) and \( p_2 = 2 \) divides \( p_3 = 1 \), which again violates the condition.

To construct a valid permutation, one needs to ensure that no two adjacent elements in the permutation satisfy the divisibility condition. A simple and effective way to achieve this is to alternate between the highest and lowest remaining numbers, ensuring that no number divides another.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(n // 2):
            p[2 * i], p[2 * i + 1] = p[n - 1 - i], p[i]
        print(*p)
```

This version alternates between the highest and lowest remaining numbers, ensuring that no number divides another.
