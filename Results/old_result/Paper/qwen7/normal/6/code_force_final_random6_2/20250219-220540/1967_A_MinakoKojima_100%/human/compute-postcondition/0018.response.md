Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, `k` is equal to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, and `ans` is increased by `dif`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is set to 0 and no operations are performed on it. The value of `dif` also remains unchanged as it is not modified. The value of `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `dif * (0 + 1)` or simply `dif`. The value of `ans` is increased by `dif`, but since `ans` was already increased by `dif` before this line of code, the net effect is that `ans` is now increased by `2 * dif`. However, since only the immediate change due to the given operation is asked, we state that `ans` is increased by `dif`.
