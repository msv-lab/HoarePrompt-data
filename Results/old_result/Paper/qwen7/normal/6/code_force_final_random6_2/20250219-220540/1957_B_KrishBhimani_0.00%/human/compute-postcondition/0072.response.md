The loop condition is `k`, so the loop can execute one more time if `k` is non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `k // 2` and must be non-zero. This means that `k` was non-zero before the division, but after the division, it must still be non-zero for the loop to continue.

Given that `k` is now `k // 2` and must be non-zero, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` itself. It must remain non-zero after the division.

State: **`i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` must be non-zero, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (0 - 1)), -1, (1 << 0), ... , -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)], `c` is 16, `k0` is 1**
