Postcondition: **`bets` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `t` is 0, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their GCD when taken pairwise, `i` is the length of list `l`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `a[i-1]` for each iteration of the loop from `i=1` to `i=bets`. The condition `sumo < prod` holds true after the loop runs.**
