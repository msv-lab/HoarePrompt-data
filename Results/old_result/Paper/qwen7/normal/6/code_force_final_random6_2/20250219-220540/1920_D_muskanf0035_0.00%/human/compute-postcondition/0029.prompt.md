You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(op_type, value)` indicating the type of operation and the value associated with it, and `queries` is a list of positive integers representing the positions Jayden wants to know the elements at.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: The `array` will contain the elements as specified by the `operations` list, and `result` will remain an empty list.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: Output State: The `queries` list has been fully iterated over, meaning `k` takes on each value in `queries` exactly once. For each iteration, `result` appends an element calculated as `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`. Therefore, `result` is a list containing `len(queries)` elements, where each element corresponds to the value of `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` for each `k` in `queries`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `result` will contain `len(queries)` elements, each being the element from `array` at the index specified by `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.
    return result
    #The program returns a list `result` containing `len(queries)` elements, where each element is the element from `array` at the index specified by `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `operations` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers indicating the type of operation and the value associated with it), and `queries` (a list of positive integers representing the positions to query). It returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the specified indices after performing all the operations.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `result` containing `len(queries)` elements, where each element is the element from `array` at the index specified by `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
