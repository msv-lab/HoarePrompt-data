Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is 2, `a` is equal to the original value of `l[2]`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, and `c` is equal to `c` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `c`, we only know that `c` has been incremented. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
