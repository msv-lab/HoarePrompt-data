Postcondition: **`bullets_used` is `health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `2 * health`, and if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
