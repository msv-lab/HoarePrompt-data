Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n-1`. For the loop to have completed all its iterations without returning 'YES', it must be true that for every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]` holds. If any index `i` from `0` to `n-1` satisfies both `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, the function would have returned 'YES' before completing all iterations. Therefore, the function does not return 'YES' after all iterations, and the final state is that the loop has completed without interruption, with `i` set to `n-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms: After running the loop through all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`. The function did not return 'YES' during these iterations, meaning for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, at least one of the conditions `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]` is true.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', with i being equal to n-1 and the loop having completed all its iterations without finding any index where both a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] hold.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \)), and two strings \( a \) and \( b \), each consisting of exactly \( n \) lowercase Latin letters. It also accepts a third string \( c \) of the same length. The function checks if there exists any index \( i \) from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) where both \( a[i] \neq c[i] \) and \( b[i] \neq c[i] \) are true. If such an index is found, the function returns 'YES'. If no such index exists, the function returns 'NO', with the loop having completed all its iterations and the variable \( i \) set to \( n-1 \).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, with `c` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` being the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `b` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, representing the total number of iterations the loop will execute.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the 1000 iterations of the loop, `t` is 1000, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration, `result` is the last (1000th) element in the `results` list.
    #
    #In this final state, the `results` list will contain the return values from calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` exactly 1000 times, with `t` set to 1000 indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `c`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state, since these values do not change within the loop. The `result` variable will hold the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` during the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 1000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n`). It then calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and stores the return values in a list. Finally, it prints the return values of `func_1` for all test cases.
