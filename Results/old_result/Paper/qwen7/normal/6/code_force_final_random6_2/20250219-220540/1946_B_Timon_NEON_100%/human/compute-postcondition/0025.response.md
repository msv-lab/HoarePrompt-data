Output State: **`segments_variants` remains an empty list, `new_segment` becomes [arr[i], i], `max_segment` is now [max_segment[0] + arr[i], i], `max_sum` remains -1 if `arr[i]` is non-negative.**

Explanation: The code updates `max_segment[0]` by adding `arr[i]` to its current value. The other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `max_sum` remains -1.
