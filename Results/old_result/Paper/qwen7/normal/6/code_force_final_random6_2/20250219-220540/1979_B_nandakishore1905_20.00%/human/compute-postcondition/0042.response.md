Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This implies that `i` is incremented by 1, but since the value of `i` itself is not needed for the print statement, we can ignore this detail.
- `n` is an input integer: This means `n` is some integer provided as input.
- `m` is an input integer: Similarly, `m` is another integer provided as input.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`: Therefore, `k` is calculated as \( |n - m| \).

The print statement is:
```python
print(k)
```

This will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Output: **|n - m|**
