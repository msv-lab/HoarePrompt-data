Output State: **`i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the value [0], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], `k` is the current value of `k` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. The values of `arr`, `c`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
