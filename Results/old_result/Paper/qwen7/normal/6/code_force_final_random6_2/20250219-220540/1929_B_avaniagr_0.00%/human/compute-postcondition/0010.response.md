Output State: The loop processes each line of input until there are no more lines to read. For each line, `n` and `k` are integers where `n` is between 2 and \(10^8\) inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and \(4n - 2\) inclusive. After processing all lines, the loop terminates, and the final values of `n` and `k` from the last line of input are used in the calculation.

The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` evaluates to either the value of `2 * n` or `k` itself, depending on the relationship between `k` and `4 * n - 3`. Specifically, if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`, the result is `2 * n`; if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, the result is `k`; otherwise, it is `2 * n`.

Thus, the final output state is the result of applying this expression to the last line's `n` and `k` values processed by the loop.
