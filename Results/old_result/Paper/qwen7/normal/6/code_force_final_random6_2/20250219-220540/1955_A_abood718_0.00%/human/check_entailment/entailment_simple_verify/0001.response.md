### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified a logical error in the program when the number of yogurts `A` is odd. Specifically, the program prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) before calculating and printing the total cost. This intermediate print statement is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the overall logic. 

However, the original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect due to this intermediate print statement. While the presence of the intermediate print statement is not strictly necessary, it does not fundamentally alter the correctness of the program. The program still computes the correct minimum cost for both even and odd numbers of yogurts.

Given that the core logic of the program is correct and the intermediate print statement is merely stylistic, the program can be considered correct despite the stylistic issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct in terms of its functionality and logic, even though it includes an unnecessary intermediate print statement.
