### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'NONE'.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the logic implemented in the function matches the required conditions for determining whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the given conditions.
