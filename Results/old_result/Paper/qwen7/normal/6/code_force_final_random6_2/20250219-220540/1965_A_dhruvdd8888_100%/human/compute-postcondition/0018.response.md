Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(nums) - 2, 0, -1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(nums) - 2` to `0` (exclusive), decrementing by `-1`. This means the loop will run as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is currently set to the length of `nums`.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Since `i` is initially set to the length of `nums`, and `nums` is a non-empty list (as it includes '0'), the length of `nums` will be a positive integer. Therefore, `i` will be a positive integer.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `cw`, `ls`, and `nw` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. They can remain as they are.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`cw` is `True`, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `nw` is `True`**.
