Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input split by spaces.
- The current value of `B` is such that `B * 2` is less than `C`.

We need to determine the value of `A * B` to be printed.

Since `B` is an integer and `B * 2 < C`, `B` must be an integer less than `C / 2`. However, the exact value of `B` is not specified, but it doesn't affect the multiplication with `A` directly. We only need to know that `A` and `B` are integers.

The print statement `print(A * B)` will output the product of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers from the input)**
