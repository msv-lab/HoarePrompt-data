Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is True, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bullets_used` is `health`, `can_survive` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bullets_used` is `2 * health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `2 * health`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bullets_used` is `3 * health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least three tuples, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of the next `pos` in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `total_bullets_needed > distance * k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
