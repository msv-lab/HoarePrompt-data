Output State: The `queries` list has been fully iterated over, meaning `k` takes on each value in `queries` exactly once. For each iteration, `result` appends an element calculated as `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`. Therefore, `result` is a list containing `len(queries)` elements, where each element corresponds to the value of `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` for each `k` in `queries`.

In simpler terms, `result` will contain `len(queries)` elements, each being the element from `array` at the index specified by `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.
