Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `y` is `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, and the relationship between `x` and `y` (where `y` is `x - 1`) is preserved. The input integer for `x` is specified to be between 1 and 1000, so `y` will be an integer between 0 and 999.
