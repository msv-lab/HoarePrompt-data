Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and then converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is stored in the variable `lit`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
