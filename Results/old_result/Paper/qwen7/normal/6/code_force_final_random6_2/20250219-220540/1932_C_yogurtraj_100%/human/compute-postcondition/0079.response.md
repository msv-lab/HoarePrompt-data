Output State: **`i` is `n - 3` or `n - 4`, `n` is an integer, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `y[-1]` which is equal to `k`, `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m`, `y[i]` is equal to `k`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`. The values of `i`, `n`, `y`, and `y[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is in the value of `k`.
