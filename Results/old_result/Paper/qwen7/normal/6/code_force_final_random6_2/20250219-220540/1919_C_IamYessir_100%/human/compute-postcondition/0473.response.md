Postcondition: `s` is 3, `i` is 4, `a` is a non-empty list, and if the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `i-1`, then the postcondition holds as specified in the if part. If the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` is not met, the postcondition still holds as there is no additional change specified in the else part.
