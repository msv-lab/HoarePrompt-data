Output State: **`pq` is a heap from which an element (price + price_increase, day) was popped; `price` is the first element of the popped tuple, which is now updated to `price + price_increase`; `day` is the second element of the popped tuple.**

This means that the price of the item, which was initially part of a tuple popped from the heap, has been increased by `price_increase`. The day remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. The heap `pq` now contains the updated price and the original day of the item.
