Output State: **`a` is a list with the last element updated to `lit[i]`, `b` is unchanged, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) + 4`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is defined as `len(b) + 4`, `i` remains unchanged because the length of `b` does not affect its value. All other variables remain in their initial state except for `a`, which now includes the new element `lit[i]`.
