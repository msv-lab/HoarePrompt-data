Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 6, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, and `ul` is `ul` plus 2. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `l[a[i] - 1]` remains 2. Otherwise, `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged. Additionally, `ul` is equal to `k * 2`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
