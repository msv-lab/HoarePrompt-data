Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` must be equal to `n`, `r` must be `n - 2`, `sunks` is either 3 or 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `l == r` is true, then `sunks` is either 3 or 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no modification to other variables in the if part, their states remain as per the precondition.
