Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. The input reading and processing logic seems correct and aligns with the problem statement.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function takes the necessary parameters and calls `calculate_score` for both players' starting positions. It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'). The logic here also seems correct.
3. **Function `calculate_score`**: This function correctly calculates the score for a given starting position by handling both non-cyclic and cyclic parts of the permutation. It accounts for the full cycles and the remaining steps after completing whole cycles. The logic for calculating scores and handling cycles is sound.

Given that all three functions work together to process the input, calculate the scores, and determine the winner based on the problem description, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
