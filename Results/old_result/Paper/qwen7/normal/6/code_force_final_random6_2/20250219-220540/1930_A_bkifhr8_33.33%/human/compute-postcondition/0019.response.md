Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - The postcondition given indicates that if the length of `lst` is not 2, `i` remains 0 and `n` remains a positive integer.
   - If the length of `lst` is 2, `i` remains 0 and `n` remains a positive integer, with `ans` being updated accordingly.

2. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(n * 2)`, meaning the loop will continue as long as `i < n * 2`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `n`, we need to update these variables for the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer (since it was not specified otherwise, we assume it remains unchanged).

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.

6. **Post-Iteration State**:
   - The state of `ans` does not change because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed inside the loop that would affect `ans`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is either the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[1]) - 1`, or `0 + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, depending on whether the length of `lst` is not 2, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer.**
