Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `y` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, and both are integers; `lst[b]` now includes `a`.**

Explanation: The code `lst[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list located at index `b` in the list `lst`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
