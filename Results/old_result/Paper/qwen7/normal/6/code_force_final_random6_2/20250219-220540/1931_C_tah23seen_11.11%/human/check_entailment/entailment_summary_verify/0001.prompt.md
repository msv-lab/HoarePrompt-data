You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
    if i > j:
        return 0
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
    if j != len(arr) - 1:
        return j - i + 1
    return j - i



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns one of three values based on the conditions met within the list:
- It returns 0 if no valid pair of indices `(i, j)` satisfying specific conditions exists.
- It returns the length of a subarray from index `i` to `j` (inclusive) if a valid pair exists and meets certain criteria.
- It returns -1 if no valid pair is found and the end of the list is reached without meeting the criteria.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, it reads the array `arr` and calls the function `func_1(arr)` to determine the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.
3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers `i` and `j` at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then checks if the elements at these pointers are equal. If they are, it moves both pointers inward, checking adjacent elements until they find a pair of unequal elements.
   - If the entire array is uniform (i.e., `i > j`), it returns 0 because no operations are needed.
   - If there is a segment of unequal elements, it calculates the length of this segment (`j - i + 1`) and returns it as the cost. This logic assumes that setting the entire segment to the value of the first element in the segment would be the most cost-effective operation.

However, the function `func_1` does not cover all possible scenarios to achieve the minimum cost. Specifically, it only considers one operation where the entire segment between `i` and `j` is set to the value of the first element in the segment. It does not consider other possible operations that might be cheaper, such as setting parts of the segment to different values.

Given the problem statement, the goal is to minimize the cost of making all elements equal, which can be achieved by potentially splitting the segment into smaller segments and applying multiple operations. The current implementation only considers one operation and does not explore other possible optimal solutions.

Therefore, the provided solution is incomplete and may not always yield the minimum cost.
