Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `ul` is incremented by 2, `ur` is `ur + 2`, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the program exits the current context where the `break` statement is placed. The values of the variables `res`, `ul`, `ur`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
