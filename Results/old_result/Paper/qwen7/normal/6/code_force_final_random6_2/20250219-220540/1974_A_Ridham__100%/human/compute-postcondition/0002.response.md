Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder) and `n`.

2. **Determine the Adjustments Needed**:
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not require adjustment since it is used as a counter.
   - The variable `n` determines whether the loop will execute. For the loop to run, `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Consider the Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.
   - `result` is an empty list. This value does not affect the loop's execution.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
