Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by the user. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and generates a specific string based on the value of \( n \). If \( n \) is greater than 52, it appends "zz" to a string formed from the 53rd character of the alphabet. If \( n \) is between 28 and 52, it appends the 29th character of the alphabet followed by "z". If \( n \) is 27, it sets the string to "aay". If \( n \) is between 3 and 26, it appends "aa" followed by the \( n \)-th character of the alphabet. The function prints the generated string for each test case.**
