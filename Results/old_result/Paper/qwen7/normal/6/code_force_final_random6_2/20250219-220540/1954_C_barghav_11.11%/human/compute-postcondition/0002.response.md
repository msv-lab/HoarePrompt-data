Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `len(a)` is greater than 0. This means that `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to run.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration.
   - The list `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `a` has at least one element before the loop starts. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `b`, and `i`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given information.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`a` must have at least one element**
