Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an integer input from the user.
- `b` is an integer input from the user.
- `test` must be at least 1.
- `t` is 0.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is odd.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement will print the string 'Alice' regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `test`, and `t`.

Output: **Alice**
