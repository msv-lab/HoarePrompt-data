Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `vis[s]` is 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**

Explanation: The code updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `cur + k * a[s]`. It also updates `cur` to be `cur + a[s]`. The values of `k`, `vis[s]`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
