### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements of an array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times. The operation involves choosing a subarray and setting all elements in that subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray.

#### Provided Functions
1. **func_1(lst):**
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates the sum of the subarray plus the contribution from the remaining parts of the array, and keeps track of the best subarray found.
   - However, the logic here is flawed because it doesn't correctly compute the MEX and the new sum after setting the subarray to the MEX value.

2. **func_2(r, l, ops: list):**
   - This function recursively constructs a sequence of operations.
   - It seems to be intended to build a sequence of operations to transform the array, but it doesn't actually compute the MEX or update the array values.

3. **func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):**
   - This function is supposed to perform the actual operation on the subarray and record the operation.
   - It incorrectly sets the subarray to the length of the subarray instead of the MEX value.
   - It also includes redundant operations and does not correctly handle the MEX calculation.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function iterates through all possible subarrays and calculates a value `sm` which is the sum of the elements before and after the subarray plus the square of the length of the subarray.
   - This approach does not correctly compute the MEX value and the resulting sum after setting the subarray to the MEX value.
   - The MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and the sum should be updated accordingly.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function is intended to build a sequence of operations but does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It simply appends operations without considering the MEX value or the correct sum.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - This function incorrectly sets the subarray to the length of the subarray instead of the MEX value.
   - It also includes redundant operations and does not correctly handle the MEX calculation.
   - For example, if the subarray is set to the length of the subarray, it does not maximize the sum as required.

#### Correct Solution
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Compute the MEX value for each subarray.
2. Update the subarray to the MEX value.
3. Keep track of the operations performed.

The provided functions do not correctly implement these steps. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly solve the problem according to the problem description.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
