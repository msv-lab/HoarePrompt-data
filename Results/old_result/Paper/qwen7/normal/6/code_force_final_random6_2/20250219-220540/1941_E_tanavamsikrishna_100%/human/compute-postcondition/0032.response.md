Output State: **`i` is `2d + 3`, `min_heap` is empty, and each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 3` is updated to the original value plus `e[0] + 1` for each tuple popped from `min_heap`**.

Explanation: The loop has terminated, and the value of `i` remains `2d + 3`. The `min_heap` is now empty since all tuples have been popped. Each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 3` has been updated to its original value plus `e[0] + 1` for each tuple popped from `min_heap`.
