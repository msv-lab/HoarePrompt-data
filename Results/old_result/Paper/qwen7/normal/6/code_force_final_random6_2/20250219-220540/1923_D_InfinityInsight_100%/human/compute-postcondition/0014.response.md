Output State: **`left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1 and -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `last.append(last[-1])` appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. Initially, `last` contains -1 and possibly another -1 or 2. After appending the last element, if the last element was -1, it becomes [-1, -1]. If the last element was 2, it would become [-1, 2]. However, since the initial state specifies that `last` contains -1 and possibly another -1 or 2, after appending, `last` will contain -1 and -1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
