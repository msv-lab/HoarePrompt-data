Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the logic for performing the operations to maximize the sum of the array. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined but not used in the context of solving the problem. The function `func_3` is partially implemented but does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem.

2. **Logic for Maximizing Sum**: The problem requires inserting sums of contiguous subarrays into the array to maximize its sum. The current implementation does not provide a mechanism to calculate these sums or insert them back into the array.

3. **Potential Case Analysis**:
   - Consider an array with negative values and a small number of operations (`k`). For example, the input:
     ```
     2 1
     -4 -7
     ```
     The optimal strategy would be to take the sum of the entire array and insert it back into the array. This would result in the array becoming `[11, -7]`, with a sum of `4`. However, the program does not perform this operation, leading to an incorrect result.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
