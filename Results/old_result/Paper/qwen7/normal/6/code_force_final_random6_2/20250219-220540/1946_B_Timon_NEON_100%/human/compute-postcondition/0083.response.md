The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function processes this list and finds the segment with the largest first element that has a length greater than 1. It retains the values of `segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `i` from after the third iteration of the loop. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the segment with the largest first element that has a length greater than 1, while retaining specific variables' values from after the third iteration of a loop.**
