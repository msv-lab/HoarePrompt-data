Functionality: **The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4. It calculates and returns the product of all elements in the list `l`, divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each pair of elements as they are multiplied together. The function does not modify the input list `l`. After the function executes, the variable `g` holds the computed result, while `t` remains 0 and `i` equals the length of the input list `l`.**
