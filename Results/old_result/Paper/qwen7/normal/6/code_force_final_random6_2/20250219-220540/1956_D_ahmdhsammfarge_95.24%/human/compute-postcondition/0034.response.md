Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `i`, and `len(lst)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2
   - `sm` is equal to `over_sum`
   - Either `r` is `i` or `l` is `j`

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(lst)`.
   - Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `len(lst)` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 3.
   - `len(lst)` remains unchanged from the previous state.
   - `sm` and `over_sum` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `r` and `l` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` will be 3.
   - `lst` is still a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2.
   - `sm` is still equal to `over_sum`.
   - Either `r` is `i` or `l` is `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 3, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` is equal to `over_sum`, and either `r` is `i` or `l` is `3`**.
