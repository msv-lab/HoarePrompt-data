Postcondition: **`N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of N integers, `den` is the result of applying `func_1` successively to the elements of `vals` starting with the first element and using each subsequent element as the argument for `func_1`, `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` using integer division, `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`, and the current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.**
