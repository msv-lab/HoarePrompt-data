Postcondition: `h` is an integer converted from the first part of the input split by ':', `m` is an integer converted from the second part of the input split by ':', and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is 12, `h` remains 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
