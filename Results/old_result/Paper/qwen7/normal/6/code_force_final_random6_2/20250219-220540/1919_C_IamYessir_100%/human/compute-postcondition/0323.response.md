Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity.**

The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `x`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The only new information is that `x` is set to infinity.
