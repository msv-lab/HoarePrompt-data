Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `num` which is being iterated over in the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is 3
   - `arr` is a non-empty list that does not contain the first element
   - `num` is the second element in the list
   - `mod_y_key` is `num % y`
   - `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is 3
   - `mod_x_key` is `num % x`
   - `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is 1 plus the previous value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0)`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the second element in the list, after the current iteration, `num` will be the third element in the list.
   - The list `arr` will now be missing its third element (since it is being iterated over).
   - `mod_y_key` will be updated to the new `num % y`.
   - `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` will be updated based on the new value of `mod_y_key`.
   - `mod_x_key` will be updated to the new `num % x`.
   - `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` will be updated to 1 plus the previous value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0)`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `count` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 4.
   - `arr` will be a non-empty list that does not contain its third element.
   - `num` will be the third element in the list.
   - `mod_y_key` will be `num % y`.
   - `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` will be updated based on the new value of `mod_y_key`.
   - `mod_x_key` will be `num % x`.
   - `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` will be 1 plus the previous value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0)`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`count` is 4, `arr` is a non-empty list that does not contain its third element, `num` is the third element in the list, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is updated, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is 1 plus the previous value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0)`**
