Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n - 2`, `cn` will be the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `num`, and the loop will exit if any pair of consecutive elements in `num` are not equal.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n - 2`, indicating it has iterated through the list up to the second-to-last element. The variable `cn` will hold the count of how many times consecutive identical elements were found starting from the first element of the list `num`. The loop will have exited as soon as it encounters a pair of consecutive elements in `num` that are not equal.
