Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The loop has already executed `n` times, which means `i` is currently at `n`.
   - The loop will run from `0` to `n`, inclusive, so `i` will take values from `0` to `n + 1`.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop has already executed `n` times, `i` should be set to `n` initially.
   - The loop will iterate from `0` to `n + 1`, so `i` must be able to take all these values.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`, which should be set to `n` initially.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the same as given, and other variables are irrelevant for adjusting the loop execution**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is `n`**
