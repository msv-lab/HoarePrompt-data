Output State: **`i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `lit`. The initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `s` is defined but not yet updated since the comparison logic hasn't been executed.
