Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be initialized to 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `flag` is True (this variable is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (this variable is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (this variable is not relevant to the loop execution).

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to set `i` to 1 and ensure `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
