Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `t` and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial state.
