Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2 // 5`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28`**.

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to `t // 5`, which means `t` is now equal to `b * 2` divided by 5 using integer division. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
