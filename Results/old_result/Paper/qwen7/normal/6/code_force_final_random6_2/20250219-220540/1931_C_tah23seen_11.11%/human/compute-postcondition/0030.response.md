Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `j` + 2 and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - We know from the previous state that `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]`. Therefore, `i - 1` is the index just before `i`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`, the next state should ensure that this condition holds true for the next iteration.
   - To satisfy the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` in the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i = i + 1`), making the new condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` hold true.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. It should be set to `i + 1`.
   - The value of `j` should also be adjusted accordingly since `i` is now `j + 3` (because `i` was originally `j + 2`).

Therefore, the modified state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is equal to `j` + 3 and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]`**
