### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves, where each move places a rook and its mirrored counterpart is placed by the computer. The goal is to calculate the number of distinct configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then processes each move, reducing the effective size of the board by 1 for each move if the coordinates are the same (indicating the computer cannot mirror the move) or by 2 otherwise.
   - Finally, it calls the function `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible configurations.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations.
   - It initializes `dp` with `[1, 1]`.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, it updates `dp` using the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`.
   - It removes the oldest element from `dp` before adding the new element.
   - The function returns the last element of `dp`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The provided example and the state of the program before the function call suggest that the function correctly implements the logic to compute the number of configurations.
   - The function's implementation matches the problem's requirements and constraints.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly computes the number of possible final configurations for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
