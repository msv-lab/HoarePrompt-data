Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is calculated based on the specified conditions, `idx` is `n + 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `n + 2` to `n + 3`. The other variables (`results`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
