Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given state, `i` is equal to `len(b)`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop `for i in range(0, n)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `len(b)`, and `len(b)` is 0 (because `b` is an empty list), `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 0, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
