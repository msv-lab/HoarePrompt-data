### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring that was shifted.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1()` is supposed to handle a single test case.
   - `func_2()` is supposed to handle multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

3. **`func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function reads a list of integers from input but does not actually use this list. Instead, it should read a single binary string.
   - It initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string (which is incorrectly treated as a list of integers).
   - If it encounters a '1', it increments `n`.
   - If it encounters a '0' after encountering at least one '1', it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

4. **Issues with `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads a list of integers instead of a binary string. This will cause issues because the input should be a single string.
   - The logic to calculate the minimum cost is incorrect. The current logic does not account for the actual positions of '0's and '1's and how they need to be rearranged via cyclic shifts.

5. **Expected Correct Logic**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest prefix of '1's and then count the number of '0's that come after this prefix. The cost would be the sum of the lengths of these segments plus the length of the remaining part of the string.

6. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The summary for `func_2()` indicates that it processes an unspecified number of test cases, each represented by a binary string. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the variable `t` (representing the number of test cases) remains greater than 0.
   - However, the summary does not mention the handling of the binary string within `func_1()`, which is crucial for the problem.

7. **Correct Implementation**:
   - We need to identify the longest prefix of '1's and then count the number of '0's that follow this prefix. The cost will be the sum of the lengths of these segments plus the length of the remaining part of the string.
   - For example, in the string "101011", the longest prefix of '1's is "11" (length 2), followed by "01011" (5 characters). The cost would be 2 (prefix) + 5 (remaining part) = 7.

8. **Evaluation of Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the provided code is incorrect due to reading a list of integers instead of a binary string and the incorrect logic for calculating the minimum cost.
   - The function summary for `func_2()` does not provide enough information to validate the correctness of the implementation within `func_1()`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately pointed out the issues with the provided code. The function summaries do not contradict this assessment. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
