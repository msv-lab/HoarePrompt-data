Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `cnt[c]` is incremented by `(1 if c == 0 else 2)`, `c` is the next element in `s`, and `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` increments `ans` by 1 only if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. The other variables (`cnt[c]`, `c`, and `cnt[c]`) are incremented as per their respective conditions, but the exact values of these variables are not specified in the initial state, so they remain as described.
