Output State: `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`, `c` is 15, `ans` is a list containing the values `[-32768, 4294967296, 131072, 32768, 8192, 2048, 512, 128, 32, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each value in the list `arr`. After the first iteration, it checks if `c` equals `n - 1`, which is true (as `c` becomes `n - 1` and `ans` is updated accordingly). It then breaks out of the loop. For the remaining iterations, `i` starts from 32 (after the first iteration) and continues to 0, but since the loop breaks after the first iteration, only the first three values are considered. The values of `i` decrease as the loop progresses, and `ans` is updated with the appropriate values based on the bitwise shift operation `1 << i`. The final value of `c` is 15 because there are 16 elements in `arr`, and the loop increments `c` once before breaking.
