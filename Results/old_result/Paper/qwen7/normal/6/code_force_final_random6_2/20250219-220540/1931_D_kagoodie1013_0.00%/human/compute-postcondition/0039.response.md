Output State: **`count` is 0 + (mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)), `arr` is a non-empty list, `num` is the first element in the list, `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

In natural language: `count` is updated by adding the values from `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`. The value of `count` was initially 0. `arr` remains a non-empty list with `num` as its first element, and `mod_y` remains as `num % y`.
