Output State: **`ind` is 11, `i` is 8, `n` is the first integer from the input provided by the user.**

The code creates a list from the input split by spaces and assigns the first element of that list (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. Since the initial values of `ind` and `i` are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged. The value of `n` depends on the first integer entered by the user when the input function is called.
