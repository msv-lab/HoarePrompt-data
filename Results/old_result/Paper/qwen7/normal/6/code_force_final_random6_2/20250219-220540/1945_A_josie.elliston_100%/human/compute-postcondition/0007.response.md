Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both of which are non-negative integers. It returns None in the first case. In the second case, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3, adjusting `extroverts` to be divisible by 3 if `extroverts % 3 + universals` is greater than or equal to 3, while keeping `universals` unchanged.**
