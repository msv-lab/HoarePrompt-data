Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even). For each test case, it takes two strings of length n, each consisting only of '<' and/or '>', and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with specific constraints on the values of t and n, and process pairs of strings of length n made up of '<' and '>'. The function does not return a single value but processes and likely compares these strings for each test case.
