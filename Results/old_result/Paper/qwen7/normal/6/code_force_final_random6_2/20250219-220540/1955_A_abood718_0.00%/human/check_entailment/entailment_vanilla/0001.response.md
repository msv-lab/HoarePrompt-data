Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price for one yogurt (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
     - Otherwise, it's cheaper to use the promotion.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, it calculates the total cost using the promotion price:
     - `print(int(A * C / 2))`
     - This is correct because buying `A/2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price will cover all `A` yogurts.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, it splits the calculation into:
     - Buying `X` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
     - Buying one additional yogurt at the individual price.
   - However, the program incorrectly prints `X` before calculating the final cost:
     - `print(X)`
     - `print(X * C + B)`
     - This is incorrect because it should directly compute and print the total cost without an intermediate print statement.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the issue, we need to remove the intermediate print statement and directly calculate and print the total cost for odd numbers of yogurts.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in handling the case when the number of yogurts `A` is odd. It prints an intermediate value which is not required. After fixing this, the program should work correctly.

**Correctness: False**
