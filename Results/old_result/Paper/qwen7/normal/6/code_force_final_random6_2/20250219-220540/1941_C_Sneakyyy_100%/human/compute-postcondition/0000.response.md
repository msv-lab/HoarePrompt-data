Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`. This means the loop will execute based on the number of times `int(input())` evaluates to a non-zero value.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Given the initial state, we know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, `int(input())` will return a positive integer, ensuring the loop will execute at least once.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop will execute at least once, we need to ensure that the input provided by `int(input())` is valid. The initial state tells us that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range. Thus, the loop will execute at least once with the value of `t`.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the one related to the input that will be read by `int(input())`, which is `t`.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)

Since the loop will execute at least once with the value of `t`, the state can be simplified to just the range of `t`.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
