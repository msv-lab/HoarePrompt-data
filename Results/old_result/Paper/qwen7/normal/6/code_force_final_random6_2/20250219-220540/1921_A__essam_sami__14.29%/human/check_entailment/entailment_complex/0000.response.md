Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the squared distances between the diagonally opposite corners of the square and printing the smaller of the two distances. However, this approach is flawed because the smaller distance might not correspond to the side length of the square. Instead, the diagonal distance should be used to calculate the side length and subsequently the area.

Here's why the given code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Diagonal Distance**: The code calculates the squared distance between pairs of points, but it does not ensure that these points form the diagonals of the square. The correct approach would be to identify the diagonals correctly.

2. **No Proper Identification of Diagonals**: The code does not have any logic to identify which pairs of points form the diagonals of the square. Simply taking any pair of points and comparing their distances is insufficient.

3. **Area Calculation Based on Incorrect Distance**: Even if the distances were correctly identified, the area calculation would still be incorrect because the area of a square is the side length squared, and the diagonal distance needs to be divided by \(\sqrt{2}\) to get the side length.

To fix this, the code should:
- Identify the diagonals correctly.
- Calculate the diagonal distance.
- Divide the diagonal distance by \(\sqrt{2}\) to get the side length.
- Square the side length to get the area.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
