You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. Additionally, the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series `n / 2 - 1 / 2 + 1`, `((n / 3) - 1) / 3 + 1`, ..., `((n / m) - 1) / m + 1`, `count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, and `g` is `n / m - m - 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on \( n \) and \( m \) using a specific formula and prints the result. The function ensures that the input values meet certain constraints (i.e., \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6 \), and the sum of \( n \) and \( m \) does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^6 \)). After processing all test cases, the function prints the calculated value for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on a flawed algorithm. 

The core issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of valid pairs. The algorithm iterates through possible values of `count` and attempts to increment the count based on certain conditions, but it does not properly account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- The program should output 14 valid pairs, but it does not correctly compute this.

Here are a few specific issues:
1. The calculation of `g` and its subsequent use in updating `ans` does not accurately reflect the problem's constraints.
2. The loop condition and the way `count` is incremented do not properly handle all valid pairs.

A correct solution would involve iterating through all possible pairs (a, b) and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done more accurately using a nested loop to check each pair individually.
