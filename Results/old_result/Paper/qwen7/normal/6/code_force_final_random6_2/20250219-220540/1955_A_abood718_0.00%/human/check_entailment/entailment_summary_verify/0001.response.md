### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the program has a logical error in handling the case when the number of yogurts `A` is odd. Specifically, the program prints `X` (the number of pairs of yogurts bought at the promotion price) before calculating and printing the total cost. This intermediate print statement is unnecessary and incorrect.

The corrected program provided in the original assessment removes this intermediate print statement and directly calculates and prints the total cost for the odd number of yogurts case. This ensures that the program behaves as intended and correctly computes the minimum cost for Maxim to buy the specified number of yogurts.

Given this correction, the program now accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and function summary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program, after the necessary corrections, is now correct according to the problem description and function summary.
