You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and the sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). `c` is the final cumulative value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop for all iterations. `maxi` is the maximum value obtained during the iterations, specifically the maximum of `c` and `maxi` after processing all elements in the list `l`. The final output is calculated as \((2^k \cdot maxi - maxi + sum(l)) \mod 1000000007\).
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `maxi` will contain the maximum value of `c` across all iterations, and the final output will be computed using this `maxi`, the given `k`, and the sum of the list `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` of length `n` and two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates a value `maxi` which is the maximum cumulative sum `c` of the list elements under certain conditions (resetting `c` when encountering negative elements whose absolute value is less than or equal to `c`). It then computes the final output as \((2^k \cdot maxi - maxi + sum(a)) \mod 1000000007\) and prints it. The function handles up to \(10^4\) test cases, with \(n\) and \(k\) satisfying \(1 \leq n, k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and the total sum of \(n\) and \(k\) not exceeding \(2 \cdot 10^5\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum sum incorrectly by using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`. This formula assumes that the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) can be multiplied by `2 ** k` and then adjusted by subtracting `maxi` and adding the sum of the original array. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of inserting multiple subarray sums optimally to maximize the final sum.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5 1
4 -2 8 -12 9
```

Expected Output:
```
17
```

However, the program outputs:
```
10
```

This happens because the program calculates the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) as 10 (from the subarray `[4, -2, 8]`), and then uses the formula `(2 ** 1 * 10 - 10 + 15) % 1000000007`, which results in 10 instead of 17. The correct approach would involve considering all possible ways to insert subarray sums to maximize the final sum, not just multiplying the maximum subarray sum by `2 ** k`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
