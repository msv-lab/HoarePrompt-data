Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` itself is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is explicitly given as 2.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(min(a))
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the list `a`. Since the exact string to split is not provided, we cannot determine the exact contents of `a`. However, we know that `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting a string.

The `min(a)` function will return the smallest integer in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the smallest integer in the list `a`.

Output: **min(a) (where min(a) is the smallest integer in the list a)**
