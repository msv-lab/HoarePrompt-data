Output State: **`tickets_bought` is updated to `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `total_cost` remains 0, `pq` remains a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index excluding the one just popped, `price` remains the price of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq` plus `price_increase`, `day` remains the index of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `tickets_bought` to the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. The other variables (`total_cost`, `pq`, `price`, and `day`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
