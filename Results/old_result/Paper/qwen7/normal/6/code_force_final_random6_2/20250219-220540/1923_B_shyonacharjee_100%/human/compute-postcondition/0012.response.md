Output State: **`monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, and `can_survive` is `False`.**

The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `can_survive`. No other variables are affected, and the initial conditions remain unchanged.
