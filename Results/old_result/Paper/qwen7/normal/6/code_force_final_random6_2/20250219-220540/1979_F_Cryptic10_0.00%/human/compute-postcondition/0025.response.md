Output State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0 and `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`, and `d` is `n-2`.**

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` assigns the value returned by `func_1(d)` to both `v` and `u`. Since `v` and `u` were previously assigned the same value (the value returned by `func_1(d)`), they remain unchanged. The `path` list and `remaining_vertices` set also remain unchanged because no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet. The value of `d` remains `n-2` as no changes were made to it.
