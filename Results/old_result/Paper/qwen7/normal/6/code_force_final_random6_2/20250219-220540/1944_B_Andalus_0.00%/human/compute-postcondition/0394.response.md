Output State: **`ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is equal to `k`, `sng` is a list containing unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`, `n` is the total length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end (which is an empty list in this case), `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n-1` (which is the entire list `lst` since `n` is the total length of `lst`).**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `ldb` will be empty because each element in `ldb` is processed until `sz` reaches `k`. Since the loop breaks when `sz >= k`, and `sz` is incremented by 2 each time through the loop, once `sz` equals `k`, the loop terminates without processing any more elements in `ldb`. The value of `sz` will be exactly `k` at the end of the loop. The other variables (`sng`, `n`, `lst`, `rgt`, `rdb`, and `lft`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
