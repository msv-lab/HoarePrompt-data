Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`ans_list`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans_list` is still an empty list, `n` and `k` are still input integers, and `a` is now a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
