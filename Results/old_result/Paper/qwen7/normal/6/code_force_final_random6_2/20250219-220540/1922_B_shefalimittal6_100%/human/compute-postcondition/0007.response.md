Output State: **`idx` is 3, `t` is 1 (or greater), `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from `int(data[2])`, `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[idx])` takes the value at index `idx` in the list `data` (which is `2`), converts it to an integer using `int()`, and assigns it to `n`. Since `idx` was `2`, it now becomes `3` because the next index after `2` is `3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
