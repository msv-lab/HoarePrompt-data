Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is either 3 or 4, `x` is either `a[-1]` (which is either `lit[0]` or `x`), and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` (depending on whether `b` is empty or not). If `lit[i] > x`, then `lit[i]` becomes the last element of `a` and `i` is set to 4. If `lit[i] <= x`, then `i` remains 3, and `x` remains either `a[-1]` (which is either `lit[0]` or `x`).
