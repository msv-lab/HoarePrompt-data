Output State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0, `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v` and `v` is removed, and `d` is `n-2`.**

Explanation: The line `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the value of `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. Since `v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, and `remaining_vertices` initially contains integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`, after removing `v`, the set will contain integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
