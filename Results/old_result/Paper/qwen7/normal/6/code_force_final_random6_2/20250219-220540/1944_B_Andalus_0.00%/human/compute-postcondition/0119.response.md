Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `elem` and `rdb`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `rdb`. The loop continues as long as there are elements in `rdb`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - **`ldb`**: The state of `ldb` does not change within the loop, so it remains empty.
   - **`rdb`**: Since the loop iterates over each element in `rdb`, at the start of the next iteration, `rdb` will contain all elements except the one that was processed in the current iteration.
   - **`sz`**: The value of `sz` does not change within the loop unless the condition `k - sz >= 2` is met. Since we are starting a new iteration, we assume the condition might still be true, but we cannot determine the exact value without knowing the value of `k`.
   - **`sng`**: The state of `sng` does not change within the loop, so it remains containing at least two elements.

Given these points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `ldb` remains empty.
- `rdb` will contain all elements except the one that was processed in the current iteration.
- `sz` remains unchanged from the previous iteration unless the condition `k - sz >= 2` was met, but since we are starting a new iteration, we cannot assume any changes.
- `sng` remains containing at least two elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains at least one element (excluding the one processed in the current iteration), `sz` is 5, `sng` must contain at least two elements**.
