Output State: **`i` is 10; `bets` must be greater than 9; `sumo` is increased by the value of `prod // a[9]`; `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] = prod // a[i]` assigns the value of `prod // a[i]` to `a[i]`. Since `i` is 10, `a[i]` becomes `a[10]`. The values of `bets`, `sumo`, and `prod` remain unchanged from their initial state.
