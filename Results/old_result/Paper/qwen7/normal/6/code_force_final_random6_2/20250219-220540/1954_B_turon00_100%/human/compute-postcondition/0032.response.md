Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution.
- `cnt` is initially set to 0.
- Either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.

The print statement is simply `print(-1)`. This means that regardless of the values of `ans`, `cnt`, and `n`, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
