Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, it takes two integers x and y where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. The function does not return a specific value but processes these inputs according to the given constraints.**
