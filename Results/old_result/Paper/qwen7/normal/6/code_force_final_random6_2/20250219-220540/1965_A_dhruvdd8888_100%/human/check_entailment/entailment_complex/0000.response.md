Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game where players take turns removing a fixed number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the player who cannot make a move losing. The key insight is that the game state can be reduced to a simpler form using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads the number of piles `N` and the list of stone counts.
   - It converts the list of strings into integers and sorts them.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list, subtracting the cumulative sum from each element.
   - The function then iterates backwards through the list, setting `cw` based on the value of `nums[i]`.
   - Finally, it prints "Alice" if `cw` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.

3. **Issue Identification**:
   - The function does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the Nim-sum principle. Instead, it incorrectly manipulates the list and uses a backward iteration to set `cw` based on the values.
   - The manipulation of the list `nums` by subtracting the cumulative sum is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct solution.
   - The backward iteration and conditional checks do not accurately reflect the Nim-sum logic required to determine the winner.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.
   - If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the first player (Alice) wins; otherwise, the second player (Bob) wins.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as stated. It does not use the Nim-sum principle, which is essential for determining the winner.

Correctness: **False**
