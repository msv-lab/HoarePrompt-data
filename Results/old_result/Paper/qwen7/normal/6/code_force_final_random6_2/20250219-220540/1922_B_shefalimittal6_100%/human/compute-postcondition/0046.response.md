Output State: **`cnt` is `v[9]`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to its current value, `n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 6**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. Here, `i` is 6, so `v[i]` is `v[6]`. The values of `cnt`, `idx`, `ans`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
