Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d (all integers), a list of n lists called rows, and two additional lists called costs and total_costs. It does not return anything.**

This functionality describes a function that processes a grid represented by `rows`, where each row is a list of `m` positive integers (except the first and last elements which are 0). The function calculates the `costs` list by applying another function `func_1(row, d)` to each row in `rows`. Then, it calculates the `total_costs` list by summing `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
