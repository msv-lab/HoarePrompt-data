Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length - 1`, `score` is `4 * score`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `current_pos` to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `score` is updated to `4 * score` due to the previous line of code where `score` was updated to `score + 2 * score`, which simplifies to `4 * score`.
