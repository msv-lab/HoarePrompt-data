Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length` and must be greater than 0, `score` is `score + (a[current_pos - 1])`**

Explanation: The code updates the `score` by adding the value of `a[current_pos - 1]` to the current `score`. The other variables (`full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, and `remainder_steps`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
