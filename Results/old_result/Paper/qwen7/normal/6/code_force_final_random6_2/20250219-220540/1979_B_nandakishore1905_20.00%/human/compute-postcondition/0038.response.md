Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\). Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain as defined initially.**
