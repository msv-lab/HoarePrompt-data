Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not address the main task of finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing k operations. 

- `func_1` simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is not relevant to the problem.
- `func_2` attempts to find the maximum sum subarray, but it does not handle the insertion of the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array. This function does not simulate the process of inserting the sum of a subarray into the array, which is a key part of the problem.
- `func_3` is completely unused and does not contribute to solving the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for any input, hence the correctness is **False**.
