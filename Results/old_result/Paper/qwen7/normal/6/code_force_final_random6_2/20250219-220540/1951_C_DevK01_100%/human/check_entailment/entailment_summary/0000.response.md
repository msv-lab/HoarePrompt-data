Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case and ensures that `m` is at most `k`.
3. The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` for each test case.
4. It calculates the number of days `q` required to buy `k` tickets by dividing `k` by `m` and rounding up.
5. It then splits the sorted list into two parts: `N` containing the first `q` elements and the rest of the list.
6. Depending on whether `n * m` equals `k`, it calculates the cost differently:
   - If `n * m == k`, it calculates the cost considering the initial prices and the additional cost due to increasing prices.
   - Otherwise, it handles the remaining tickets after buying `n * m` tickets.
7. The program correctly prints the calculated cost for each test case and continues to the next one.
8. The overall logic respects the constraints and the problem requirements.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
