Output State: **`c` is 1, `i` is 32, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[-32, 4294967296]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 32, `1 << i` is equivalent to `2^32`, which equals `4294967296`. Therefore, `ans` now contains `-32` and `4294967296`. All other variables remain unchanged.
