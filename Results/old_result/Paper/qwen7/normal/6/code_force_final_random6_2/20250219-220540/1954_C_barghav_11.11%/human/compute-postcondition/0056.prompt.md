Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `a` and `b` are lists of the same length where, for each index `i`:
- If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, the element at index `i` in `a` is the maximum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`, and the element at index `i` in `b` is the minimum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`.
- If `i` is greater than half the length of `a` minus one, the element at index `i` in `a` is the minimum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`, and the element at index `i` in `b` is the maximum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`.

This means that the first half of the lists `a` and `b` will have their elements swapped such that the larger of the two values is in `a` and the smaller in `b`. The second half of the lists will have their elements swapped such that the smaller of the two values is in `a` and the larger in `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `b` is a list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `b` is a list that must have at least 2 elements

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `b` is a list that must have at least 2 elements




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
