Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to 3.
2. `ansv` is a list containing the elements `[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`.
3. The `print` statement accesses the element at index `i` in the list `ansv` and uses the `end=' '` parameter to ensure the next print statement starts on the same line if there were any subsequent prints.

Given that `i` is 3, we need to find the element at index 3 in the list `ansv`. In Python, list indices start from 0, so:
- `ansv[0]` is 10
- `ansv[1]` is 10
- `ansv[2]` is 10
- `ansv[3]` is 10
- `ansv[4]` is 10

Therefore, `ansv[i]` where `i` is 3, corresponds to the element `10`.

Output: **10**
