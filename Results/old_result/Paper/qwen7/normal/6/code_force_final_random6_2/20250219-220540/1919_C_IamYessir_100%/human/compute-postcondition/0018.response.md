Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being `x`, `b` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

The code assigns the last element of list `b` to the variable `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
