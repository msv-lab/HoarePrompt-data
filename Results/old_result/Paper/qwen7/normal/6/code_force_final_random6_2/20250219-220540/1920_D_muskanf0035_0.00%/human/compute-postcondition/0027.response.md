Output State: **The program returns a list `result` containing `len(queries)` elements, where each element is the element from `array` at the index specified by `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.**

This means that for each value `k` in the `queries` list, the program calculates the corresponding element in `array` using the formula `(k - 1) % len(array)`, and appends this element to the `result` list. The final `result` list will have the same length as `queries`, with each element being an element from `array` based on the specified index calculation.
