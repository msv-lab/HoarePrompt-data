Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is the size of `ldb`.
- `k - sz >= 2`.

The print statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.

Given these conditions, `elem` must refer to an element within `ldb`. Since `ldb` contains at least one element and no further details about the specific elements are provided, we can only say that `elem` is one of the elements in `ldb`.

However, since the exact value of `elem` is not specified and the print statement repeats `elem` twice, we can infer that both instances of `elem` will print the same value.

Therefore, the output will be two identical elements from `ldb`, separated by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter in the print function.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is one of the elements in the list `ldb`)**
