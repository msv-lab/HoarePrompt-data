Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is a positive integer such that \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\). It calculates the frequency of each integer in `arr` and prints the first integer `i` in the range \(0\) to \(n\) that appears exactly once in `arr`. If no such integer exists, it prints nothing. The function does not return any value.**
