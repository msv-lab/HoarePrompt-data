Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- `elem` is the next element to be processed from `ldb`.
- If `sz >= k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `sz >= k` is not met, no changes are made to the state of the variables.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Since `elem` is the next element to be processed from `ldb` and `ldb` contains at least one element, `elem` must be the first element of `ldb`.

Output: **elem elem**
