Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not properly handle the replacement of each integer with the sum of its digits.
2. The program attempts to precompute the sum of digits for all numbers up to the maximum \( n \) in the input, which is not necessary and leads to incorrect results.
3. The main issue lies in the way the `values` and `sum_values` lists are being updated. The logic for calculating the sum of digits of a number and updating the `values` and `sum_values` lists is flawed.
4. The program should iterate through each number from 1 to \( n \), compute the sum of its digits, and then update the cumulative sum accordingly.

Given the above points, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
