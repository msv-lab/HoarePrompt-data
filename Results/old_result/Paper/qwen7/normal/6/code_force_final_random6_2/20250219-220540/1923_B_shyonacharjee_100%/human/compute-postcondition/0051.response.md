Output State: **`bullets_used` is the `health` value from the second tuple in the list, `pos` is the first element of the second tuple in the list, `health` is the second element of the second tuple in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of the new `pos`.**

Explanation: The code `distance = abs(pos)` calculates the absolute value of `pos` and assigns it to `distance`. Since `pos` was already the first element of the second tuple in the list, its value does not change. The other variables (`bullets_used`, `health`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The updated value of `distance` is the absolute value of the original `pos`.
