Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and the number of test cases.
2. It checks whether \( n \) is odd or even. If \( n \) is odd, it prints 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string with an odd number of characters (as each special character needs two neighbors).
3. For even \( n \), the program constructs a string \( s \) using 'AAB' repeated \( n//2 \) times. This approach ensures that every 'B' is a special character since it has different neighbors ('A'). The string will have \( n \) special characters if \( n \) is even and within the limit of 200 characters.
4. The program correctly handles the condition that the constructed string must be of length at most 200 characters, ensuring that it prints 'NO' if the constructed string exceeds this limit.

Given the above points, the program appears to meet all the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
