Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `2 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `7 * y + x + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2)` if `y` is even or `15 * (y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15`**.

The code calculates `extra_screen` by performing integer division of `extra_space` by 15. The value of `extra_screen` is updated based on the current values of `extra_space`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
