Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that `n` is a positive integer, `a` is equal to either the original value of `b` or the element at index `x` in list `l`, and `b` is equal to the original value of `a`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each `x` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body updates `a` based on the comparison between the element at index `x` in list `l` and the current value of `a`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - The variable `x` starts from `0` and increases by `1` in each iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be `1`.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer, it remains unchanged.
   - The values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the comparison in the loop body, but we don't know the exact new values without knowing the elements in the list `l`.

5. **Post-Iteration State**: After the first iteration (where `x` is `0`), `a` and `b` will be updated according to the condition in the loop body. For the next iteration, `x` will be `1`.

Given this information, the states that need to be adjusted are `x`, `a`, and `b`.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
- `x` will be `1`.
- `a` and `b` will be updated based on the comparison in the loop body, but their exact values depend on the elements in the list `l`.

Since we cannot determine the exact values of `a` and `b` without the list `l`, we can only state the updated value of `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is 1, `a` is equal to either the original value of `b` or the element at index 1 in list `l`, and `b` is equal to the original value of `a`.**
