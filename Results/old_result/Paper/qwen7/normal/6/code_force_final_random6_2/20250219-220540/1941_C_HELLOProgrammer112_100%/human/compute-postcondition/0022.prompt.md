Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string s consists of lowercase Latin letters and has a length of n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = int(input())
    s = input()
    x = s.count('map')
    y = s.count('pie')
    z = s.count('mapie')
    print(x + y - z)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, `num_iterations` must be greater than 0; `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the new string `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s` updated to the count of 'mapie' in `s`, `num_iterations` must be greater than 0, `a` is reassigned to a new input integer, and `s` is updated to a new string input by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
