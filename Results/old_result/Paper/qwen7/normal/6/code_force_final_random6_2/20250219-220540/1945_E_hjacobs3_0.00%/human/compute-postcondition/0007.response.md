Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n; `l` is `mid` + 1; `r` is n - 1; `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2; `array[mid]` is less than `find`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is still \((0 + (n - 1)) // 2\), and the condition that `array[mid]` is less than `find` is still true.
