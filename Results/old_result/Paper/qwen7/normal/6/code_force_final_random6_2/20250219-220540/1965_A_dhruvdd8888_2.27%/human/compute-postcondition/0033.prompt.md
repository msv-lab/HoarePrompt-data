Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cd` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is now greater than 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
    if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
        cd += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cd` is either 1 or 0, depending on whether the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is equal to 1. Specifically, if the difference is 1, `cd` is set to 1; otherwise, `cd` remains 0. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cd` is either 2 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3. If `nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1`, then `cd` is set to 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cd` is either 3, 2, or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1`, then `cd` is set to 3. Otherwise, `cd` remains either 2 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
