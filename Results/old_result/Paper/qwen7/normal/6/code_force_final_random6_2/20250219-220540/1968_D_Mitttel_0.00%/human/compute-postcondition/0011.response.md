Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `index` is increased by 4.**

The code `index += 4` increments the value of `index` by 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
