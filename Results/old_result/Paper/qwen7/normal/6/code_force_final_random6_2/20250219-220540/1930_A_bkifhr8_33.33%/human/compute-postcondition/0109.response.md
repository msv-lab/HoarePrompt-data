Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `ans_f`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is an element in `ans_f`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans_f` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` is equal to another element in `ans_f`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be an element in `ans_f`.
   - Since `i` is already equal to another element in `ans_f`, it satisfies the condition for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ans_f` must still contain at least one element (as it did in the previous iteration).
   - `i` must be set to another element in `ans_f`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans_f` must contain at least one element, `i` is equal to another element in `ans_f`**
