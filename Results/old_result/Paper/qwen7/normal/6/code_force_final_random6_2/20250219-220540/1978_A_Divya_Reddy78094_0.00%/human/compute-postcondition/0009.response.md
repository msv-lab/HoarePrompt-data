Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code `nums.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `nums` in descending order. Since the initial state already mentions that `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, sorting it again in reverse does not change its order. Therefore, the list `nums` remains in the same state as before the execution of the code. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation.
