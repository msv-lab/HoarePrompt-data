Output State: **i is n-1, dif is a[n-1] - a[n-2], res is -n, ans is a[0], k is 0.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have reached `n-1`, as it starts from `n-1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `dif` will be the difference between the last two elements of the list `a`, i.e., `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`. The variable `res` decreases by 1 in each iteration, so after `n` iterations, it will be `-n`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged as it is only updated within the loop under certain conditions that do not affect its final value given the problem constraints. Finally, `k` is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration where the inner if-else block is executed, ensuring it remains 0 after all iterations.
