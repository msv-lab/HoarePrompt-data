Output State: **Postcondition: `res` contains all the elements of the list `a`, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where the line `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial postconditions.
