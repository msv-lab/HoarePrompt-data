Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `i` is equal to `N`, `tc` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each value is incremented based on the count of each element in the list `a` up to index `N-1`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is 1, `i` is less than `N`, `tc` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each value is incremented based on the count of each element in the list `a` up to index `N-1`, and either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or the current value of `cnt[i]` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tc` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is 3, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `tc` is 4, and either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` equals 0, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
