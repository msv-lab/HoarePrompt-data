Output State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `rgt` is a list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ldb = []` initializes an empty list named `ldb`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `sz`, `k`, `sng`, `n`, `lst`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
