Output State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `n` and `k` are now specific integer values obtained from user input. The values of `sz` and `sng` remain unchanged from their previous state, as they were not affected by this line of code.
