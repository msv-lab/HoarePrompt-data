Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 9, `sng` must contain at least two elements.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `rdb` will be empty because it loses at least one element in each iteration until it is exhausted. The value of `sz` increases by 2 in each iteration as long as `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. Since we know the loop executed 3 times, and each time `sz` was increased by 2 (as per the given conditions), `sz` reaches 9. The loop breaks when `sz` becomes 9, meaning `k` must be at least 12 for the loop to run fully. Therefore, `ldb` remains empty as it was not involved in any operations within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 10, `sng` contains at least 3 elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 11, `sng` contains at least 2 elements, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 12, `sng` contains at least 1 element, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
