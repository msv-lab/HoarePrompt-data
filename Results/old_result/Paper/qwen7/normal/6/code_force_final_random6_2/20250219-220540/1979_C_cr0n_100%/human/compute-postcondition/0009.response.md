Output State: `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of `N` integers, and `den` is the result of applying the function `func_1` successively to its initial value (the first element of `vals`) and each subsequent element of `vals`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `den` will be the final result obtained by sequentially applying the function `func_1` to the initial value (`den`) and each element of the list `vals`.
