Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `n` and the second input to `m`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged.
