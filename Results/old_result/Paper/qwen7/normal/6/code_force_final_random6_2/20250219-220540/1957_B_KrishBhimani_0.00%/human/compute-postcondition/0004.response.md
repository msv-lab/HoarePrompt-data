Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list.**

The code assigns the value of `k` to a new variable `k0`. This does not change the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, or `arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with the addition of `k0` being equal to `k`.
