Output State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 9, `sng` must contain at least two elements.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `rdb` will be empty because it loses at least one element in each iteration until it is exhausted. The value of `sz` increases by 2 in each iteration as long as `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. Since we know the loop executed 3 times, and each time `sz` was increased by 2 (as per the given conditions), `sz` reaches 9. The loop breaks when `sz` becomes 9, meaning `k` must be at least 12 for the loop to run fully. Therefore, `ldb` remains empty as it was not involved in any operations within the loop.
