Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `n - 2`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `n` is given as 3.

3. **Calculate the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 2`. Given `n` is 3, `n - 2` evaluates to 1. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 1.

4. **Check the current value of `i`**: Currently, `i` is 0, which is indeed less than 1. However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means we need to check if the loop will run at all based on the given initial values.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `n - 2` is 1, the loop will execute once (when `i` is 0).
   - We don't need to change `i` because it is already set to 0, which satisfies the loop condition.
   - We need to ensure that `n` remains 3 and `n - 2` remains 1, as these values determine the loop's execution.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `n` remains 3 and `n - 2` remains 1, as these values determine the loop's execution.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is 3, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is 0, `n - 2` is 1, and `i` is 0**. 

However, since `n - 2` is derived from `n`, and `n` is fixed at 3, we can simplify the final state to focus on the necessary conditions for the loop to execute:

State: **`n` is 3, `n - 2` is 1, `i` is 0**.
