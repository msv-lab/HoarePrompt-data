Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is 0, `res` is -1**

Explanation: The initial state had `i` as 0, `dif` as `a[1] - a[0]` which was 0, and `res` was not explicitly mentioned but from the operation, we infer it was 0 before this line. The code `res -= 1` subtracts 1 from `res`. Since `res` was initially 0, after executing this line, `res` becomes -1. The values of `i` and `dif` remain unchanged.
