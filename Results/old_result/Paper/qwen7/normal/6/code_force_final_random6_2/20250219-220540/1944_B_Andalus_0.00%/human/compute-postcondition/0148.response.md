Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` is empty.
- `rdb` is empty.
- `sz` is 10.
- `sng` contains at least 2 elements.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state. Since `sng` contains at least 2 elements but no specific value for `elem` is mentioned, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem`.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `elem` which is part of the `sng` list. Given the information, we can only say that `elem` is one of the elements in `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is one of the elements in the sng list)**
