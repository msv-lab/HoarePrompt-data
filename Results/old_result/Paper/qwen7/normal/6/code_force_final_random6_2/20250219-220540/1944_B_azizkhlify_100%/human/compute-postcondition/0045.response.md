Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is defined as `x + 2`.
   - `n` is defined as `y`.
   - `ul` is defined as `k * 2` if `z + 2 == k * 2`, otherwise `ul` is `z + 2`.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged as `0`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `x + 2`.
- Therefore, `a[i]` is `a[x + 2]`.

The print statement will print `a[i]` twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `k`, and `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[x + 2]`. However, we can describe it based on the given information.

Output: **a[x + 2] a[x + 2]**
