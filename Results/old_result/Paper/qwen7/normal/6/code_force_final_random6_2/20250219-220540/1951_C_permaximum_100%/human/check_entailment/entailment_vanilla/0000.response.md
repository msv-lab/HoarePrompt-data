### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to minimize the cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days.
   - Each day, we can buy up to `m` tickets.
   - Buying `x` tickets on any day increases the price of all subsequent days by `x`.

2. **Key Points in the Provided Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices.
   - It uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always consider the cheapest ticket price available.
   - It calculates the cost of buying tickets while considering the price increase after each purchase.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Heap Initialization:** The heap is initialized with tuples containing the price and index of each day's ticket.
   - **Heap Operations:** The code pops the smallest price from the heap, checks how many tickets can be bought without exceeding `k`, and updates the total cost accordingly.
   - **Price Increase:** After buying tickets, the price for all subsequent days is increased by the number of tickets bought.
   - **Loop Termination:** The loop continues until `k` tickets are purchased.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where the number of tickets to buy exceeds the number of days or the maximum tickets per day.
   - The logic ensures that the price increase is applied correctly for subsequent days.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the strategy to minimize costs.
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the cheapest tickets are considered first, which is crucial for minimizing the overall cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of purchasing `k` tickets under the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
