Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `b` must be at least 1.
- `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i\).
- `suma` is increased by 1 if \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0\). Otherwise, `b` and `x` remain unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`.
- The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- The loop continues as long as `i <= b`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments by 1, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - If the current value of `i` is the last value within the range (i.e., `i == b`), then the next value of `i` will be `b + 1`, which will exit the loop.

2. **Adjust the state of `b`:**
   - `b` remains unchanged unless the loop condition is no longer satisfied (i.e., `i` exceeds `b`).

3. **Adjust the state of `x`:**
   - `x` is defined as \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i\).
   - This value will change based on the new value of `i`, but it is not directly adjusted in the loop head. Therefore, we keep the previous value of `x`.

4. **Adjust the state of `suma`:**
   - `suma` is incremented if the condition \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0\) is met.
   - Since this condition is evaluated within the loop body and not in the loop head, the value of `suma` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that changes in the loop head is `i`.
- `b` remains unchanged unless the loop exits.
- `x` and `suma` remain unchanged.

### Final State:
- `i` will be `i + 1` (if the loop continues).
- `b` remains the same (unless the loop exits).
- `x` and `suma` remain the same.

Given the initial conditions and the loop head, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`b` must be at least 1, `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i\), and `suma` is increased by 1 if \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0\). If the condition is not met, `b` and `x` remain unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1.**
