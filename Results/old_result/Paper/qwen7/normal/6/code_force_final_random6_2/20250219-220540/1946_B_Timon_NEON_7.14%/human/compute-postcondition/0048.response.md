Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum of the original `max_segment[0]` and `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, and `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative; `segments_variants` is a list containing one additional variant which is `new_segment + [i - 1]`.**

This means that the variable `segments_variants` now includes an additional list that consists of `new_segment` followed by the value `i - 1`. The values of `i`, `arr`, `max_segment[0]`, and `new_segment` remain as described in the initial state, with `new_segment` potentially updated based on the first element of `arr`.
