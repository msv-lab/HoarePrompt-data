Output State: **`i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `[1]`, `l1` is a list containing the values split from the input string.**

The code `l1 = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to `l1`. Since the initial values of other variables (`i`, `arr`, `c`, and `ans`) are not affected by this line of code, they remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated variable `l1` which contains the split input.
