Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `len(a)` is not specified but is known to be an integer.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 each iteration (as per the range function), the next value of `i` will be 3.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Given that `i` is now 3, `len(a)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The only variables that can be adjusted based on the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`. Therefore, we need to update these variables to reflect the next possible state where the loop can continue executing.

Given this analysis, the updated states are:
- `i` is 3
- `len(a)` must be greater than 3

Since the postcondition does not specify any changes to `a` or `s` for the next iteration unless `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, and since `i` is now 3, `a[3]` must be compared with `a[2]` to determine the value of `s`.

However, the question specifically asks to adjust the states based on the loop head, so we focus on `i` and `len(a)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `len(a)` must be greater than 3**
