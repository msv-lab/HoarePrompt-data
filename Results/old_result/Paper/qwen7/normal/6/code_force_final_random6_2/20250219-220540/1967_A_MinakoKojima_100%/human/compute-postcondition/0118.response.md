Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, `res` is either -2 if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` * (0 + 1), or -1 if `k` is 0 and `ans` is 0, and `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, the values of `i`, `dif`, `res`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `break` statement only indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block.
