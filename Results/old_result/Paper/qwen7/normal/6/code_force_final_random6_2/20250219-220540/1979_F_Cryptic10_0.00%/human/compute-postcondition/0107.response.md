Based on the initial state provided:

- `d` is explicitly given as `-1`.
- `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations.
- `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations.
- `path` contains all vertices that satisfy the given conditions.
- `remaining_vertices` is an empty set because all vertices from 1 to `n` have been processed and added to `path`.

The `print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")` statement will print the contents of the `path` list, with each vertex separated by a space, prefixed by an exclamation mark.

Since the exact values of `v` and `u` are not needed for the output, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, the focus is on the `path` list.

Output: **! path (where path contains all vertices that satisfied the given conditions)**
