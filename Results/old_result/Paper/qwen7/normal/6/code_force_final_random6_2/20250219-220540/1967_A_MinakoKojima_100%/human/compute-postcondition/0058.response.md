Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `res` is either -2 or -1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dif` to `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `i + 1` becomes 3. Therefore, `dif` is now `a[3] - a[2]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
