Output State: **`i` is one of the values in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (i - 1)), -1], `c` is 2, and either `c` is not equal to `n - 1` or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Here, `k0` is `k`, which is 0, and `sum(ans)` is the sum of the elements in the list `ans` before appending. Initially, `ans` is `[0, 1, -1, (1 << (i - 1))]`. The sum of these elements is \(0 + 1 - 1 + (1 << (i - 1)) = (1 << (i - 1))\). Therefore, `k0 - sum(ans)` is \(0 - (1 << (i - 1)) = -(1 << (i - 1))\). Since `1 << (i - 1)` is a power of 2, the new value appended to `ans` is `-1` when `i = 1` and decreases by powers of 2 for other values of `i`. However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i`, we keep it as a general form. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
