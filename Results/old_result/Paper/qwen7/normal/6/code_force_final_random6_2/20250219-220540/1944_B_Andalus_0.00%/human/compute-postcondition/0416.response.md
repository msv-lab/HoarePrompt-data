Output State: **`sz` is 0**

The initial state tells us that after the loop executes all its iterations, `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 3, and `sng` must contain at least one element. However, the given code snippet simply assigns 0 to `sz`. This overrides the previous value of `sz`, setting it to 0. The condition about `sng` containing at least one element remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `sz` is now 0, while `sng` still contains at least one element.
