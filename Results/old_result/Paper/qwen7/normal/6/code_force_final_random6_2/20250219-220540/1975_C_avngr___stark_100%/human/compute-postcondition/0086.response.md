Output State: **`i` is 7, `n` must be greater than 4, `temp` is now [a[7], a[8], a[9]], `max` is `temp[1]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `temp` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. Since `temp` was initially `[a[7], a[8], a[9]]` and is now sorted, `temp[1]` will be the second smallest element in the original list `[a[7], a[8], a[9]]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
