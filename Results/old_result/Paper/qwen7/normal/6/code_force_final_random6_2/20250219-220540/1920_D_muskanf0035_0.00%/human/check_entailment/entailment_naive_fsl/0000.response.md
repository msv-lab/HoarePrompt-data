Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for handling the operations described in the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the second type of operation correctly. When `b = 2`, the function should append `x` copies of the current array to itself, but instead, it extends the current array with its own elements repeated `x` times, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following sequence of operations:
- Operation 1: Append 3
- Operation 2: Append 2 copies of the current array

Starting with an empty array:
1. After appending 3, the array is `[3]`.
2. After appending 2 copies of the current array, the array should be `[3, 3]`, but the function incorrectly extends it to `[3, 3, 3, 3]`.

This discrepancy shows that the function does not correctly simulate the described operations, making the program incorrect.
