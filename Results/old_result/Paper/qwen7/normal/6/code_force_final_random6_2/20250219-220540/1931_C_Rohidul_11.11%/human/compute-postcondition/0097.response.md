Output State: **`l` is 4, `r` is greater than 3, and `a[3]` is equal to `a[4]`; `st` is 1.**

The code `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Since `st` was not previously defined, it is initialized to 0 before this line of code. After executing `st += 1`, the value of `st` becomes 1. The other variables (`l`, `r`, and the condition on `a[3]` and `a[4]`) remain unchanged.
