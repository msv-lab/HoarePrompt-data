### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `array` starts as an empty list.
   - `result` is also initialized as an empty list.

2. **Operation Handling**:
   - For each operation in `operations`, the function checks the `op_type`:
     - If `op_type == 1`, it appends `value` to `array`.
     - If `op_type == 2`, it extends `array` with `x` copies of the current `array`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each `k` in `queries`, the function appends `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` to `result`.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- Operations: 
  1. `1 1` (Append 1)
  2. `1 2` (Append 2)
  3. `2 1` (Append 1 copy of the current array)
  4. `1 3` (Append 3)
  5. `2 3` (Append 3 copies of the current array)

**Step-by-step Execution**:
1. Initial array: `[]`
2. After `1 1`: `array = [1]`
3. After `1 2`: `array = [1, 2]`
4. After `2 1`: `array = [1, 2, 1, 2]` (1 copy of `[1, 2]`)
5. After `1 3`: `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
6. After `2 3`: `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` (3 copies of `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`)

Now, let's check the queries:
- Queries: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 16, 20`

**Query Results**:
- `k = 1`: `array[0] = 1`
- `k = 2`: `array[1] = 2`
- `k = 3`: `array[2] = 1`
- `k = 4`: `array[3] = 2`
- `k = 5`: `array[4] = 3`
- `k = 6`: `array[5] = 1`
- `k = 14`: `array[13] = 2`
- `k = 15`: `array[14] = 1`
- `k = 16`: `array[15] = 2`
- `k = 20`: `array[19] = 3`

The function correctly handles both types of operations and queries as per the problem statement.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment states that the program does not correctly implement the logic for handling the operations, specifically for the second type of operation. However, upon careful analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for both types of operations as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given operations.
