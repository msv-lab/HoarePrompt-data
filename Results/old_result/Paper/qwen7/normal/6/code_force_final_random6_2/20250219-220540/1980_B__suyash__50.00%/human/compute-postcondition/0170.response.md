Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is less than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `k` was being updated. Since the `break` statement does not change the values of `i` or `k` (other than ensuring the loop or conditional block is exited), and the condition `k` is less than or equal to 0 remains true, the only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
