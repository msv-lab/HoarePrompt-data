Output State: **`t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<'**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This input does not affect the values of `t` or the list `b`. However, it ensures that the string at index `n-2` in `b` is no longer '<', as per the condition given. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `n` and the modified list `b`.
