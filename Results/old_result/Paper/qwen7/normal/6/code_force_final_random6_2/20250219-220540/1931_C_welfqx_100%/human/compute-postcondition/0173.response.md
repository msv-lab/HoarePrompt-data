Output State: **`ii` is 4, `n` must be greater than 6, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, `f` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
