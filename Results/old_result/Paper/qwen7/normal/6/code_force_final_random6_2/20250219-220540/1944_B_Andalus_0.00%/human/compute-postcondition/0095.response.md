Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` is empty.
- `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element.
- `sz` is equal to `k + 1`.
- `sng` must contain at least one element.
- `elem` is the first element of `sng`.
- `k - sz` must be at least 1.

The print statement `print(elem, end=' ')` will print the value of `elem`, which is the first element of `sng`.

Since `sng` must contain at least one element and `elem` is explicitly stated to be the first element of `sng`, we can directly use `elem` in the output.

Output: **elem (where elem is the first element of sng)**
