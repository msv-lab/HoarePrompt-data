Output State: **`cur_arr` contains at least one element; `xor` is the XOR of `xor` and the first element of `cur_arr`; `new_arr` contains the value of `xor`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `xor` to `new_arr`. Since the initial value of `xor` is such that when shifted right by `bit` positions and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0, this property remains unchanged. The `cur_arr` and its first element remain unaffected. Therefore, `cur_arr` still contains at least one element, `xor` is updated to include the XOR operation with the first element of `cur_arr`, and `new_arr` now includes the value of `xor`.
