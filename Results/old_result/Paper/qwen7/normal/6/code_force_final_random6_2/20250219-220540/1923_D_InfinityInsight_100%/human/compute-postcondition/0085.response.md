Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is 0; `left` contains the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element; `last` still contains `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`; `a` is a non-empty list; `n` is greater than 1; `inx` remains unchanged.**

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `ans` retains its initial state with specific values at indices 2, 3, and 4, while the other elements are -1. The variable `i` is set to 0, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The `left` list now contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`. The `last` list remains unchanged, with -1 repeated throughout. The list `a` and the integer `n` also remain unchanged, and `inx` is not modified.
