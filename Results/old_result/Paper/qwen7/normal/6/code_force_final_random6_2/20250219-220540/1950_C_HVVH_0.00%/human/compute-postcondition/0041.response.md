Output State: **`h` is `h - 12`, `m` is an integer converted from the second part of the input split by ':', and `day` is 'AM'.**

Explanation: The code `h = h - 12` subtracts 12 from the value of `h`. The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `day` remains 'AM' as it is not modified by the code.
