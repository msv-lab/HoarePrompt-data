Output State: **`a` is non-empty, and its first element is now the second element of the original list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element of the list `a` (which is `0` according to the initial state) and returns it. After executing this command, the list `a` loses its first element, but since the initial state specified that `a` is non-empty and its first element must be `0`, the remaining elements shift left, making the new first element the second element of the original list.
