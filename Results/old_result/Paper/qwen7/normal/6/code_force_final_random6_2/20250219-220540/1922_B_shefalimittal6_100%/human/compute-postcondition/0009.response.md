Output State: **`idx` is 4, `t` is 1 (or greater), `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from `int(data[2])`, `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, each set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
