The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive identical elements in the array \( a \). If the array \( a \) has only one element or the minimum count of consecutive identical elements equals the length of the array, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the calculated minimum count. After processing all test cases, the function ends with \( t \) set to 0 and no further inputs to process, and the variable `ans` holding the result for each test case.
