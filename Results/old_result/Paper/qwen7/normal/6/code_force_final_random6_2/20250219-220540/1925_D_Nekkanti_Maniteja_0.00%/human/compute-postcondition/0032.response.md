Output State: **`i` is 100000, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 100000, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `a`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `M`, `c`, and `s` remain unchanged, and `a` is updated to 0.
