Output State: The loop will print all elements in the list `res` separated by spaces.

Explanation: Given that the loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in `res`, and considering the description of the final state after the third iteration, `res` contains at least one element. Since the loop prints each element of `res` on a single line separated by spaces, the output state after all iterations will be a sequence of elements from `res` printed in the order they appear in the list, separated by spaces.
