Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `len(b)`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `len(b)` and the loop will execute as long as `i < n`, we need to ensure that `len(b)` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `len(b)` must be less than `n`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `len(b)` and `n`. Specifically, `len(b)` should be less than `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `len(b)` must be less than `n`**
