Output State: **`a` is an integer value, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `b` is an integer value**.

Explanation: The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the string `b` into an integer. Since `b` was originally a string, after executing this line, `b` becomes an integer. All other variables (`a`, `t`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
