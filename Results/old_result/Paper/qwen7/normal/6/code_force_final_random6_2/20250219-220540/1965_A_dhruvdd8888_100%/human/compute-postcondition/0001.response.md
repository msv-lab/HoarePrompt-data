Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the initial number of stones in each pile, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; nums is a set containing the elements from the input split into strings.**

The code `nums = set(input().split())` takes the input as a string, splits it into individual elements, and converts them into a set of strings. The values of `t`, `N`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
