Output State: **`xor` is equal to the first element of `cur_arr`; `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it; `cur_arr` must have a length of at least 1.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `xor` is equal to the first element of `cur_arr`.
- `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it.
- `cur_arr` must have a length of at least 1.
- The code `xor ^= i` updates `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the current element `i` (which is the first element of `cur_arr`), but since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we keep it in terms of the first element of `cur_arr`.
