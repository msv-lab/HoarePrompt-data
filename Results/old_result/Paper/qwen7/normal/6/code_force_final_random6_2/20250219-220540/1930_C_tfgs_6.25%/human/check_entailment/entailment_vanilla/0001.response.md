Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It increments each element of `a` by its index plus one (`a[i] += i + 1`).
   - This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

3. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates, which is not entirely correct because the problem specifies that `S` cannot be a multiset, meaning each element must be unique when inserted.
   - Instead, it should directly use the unique elements without converting to a set, as the duplicates need to be handled properly.

4. **Sorting and Constructing `b`:**
   - The program sorts the unique elements in descending order.
   - This part is correct.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - The program calculates how many more elements are needed to reach `n` and fills them with the smallest possible values.
   - This logic seems to handle the remaining elements correctly by decrementing the last added value.

### Detailed Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Duplicates:**
  - The conversion to a set loses the count of duplicates, which is crucial for constructing the lexicographically largest array `b`.
  - The correct approach would be to keep track of the counts of each unique element and ensure that the insertion into `S` respects these counts.

### Correct Approach:
- Use a list to keep track of the unique elements and their counts.
- Ensure that when inserting into `S`, the correct count is maintained.
- Sort the unique elements in descending order and handle the remaining elements correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the duplicates and the insertion process into `S`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
