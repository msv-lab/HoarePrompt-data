Postcondition: `segments_variants` is a list that initially contains either `['max_segment + [i]'` or `['new_segment', 'i']`, `new_segment` is updated based on whether `arr[i]` is non-negative or not, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`. If `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` includes the element `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` includes `new_segment + [i - 1]`, and `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`.
