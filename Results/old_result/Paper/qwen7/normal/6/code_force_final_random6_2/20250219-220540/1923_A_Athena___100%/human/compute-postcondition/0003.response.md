Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The conditions on `t` and the nature of `n` remain unchanged.
