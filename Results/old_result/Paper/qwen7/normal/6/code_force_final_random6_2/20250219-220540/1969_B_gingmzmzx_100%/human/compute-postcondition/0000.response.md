Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the input does not affect its value. Therefore, `t` retains its initial state as an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `n` is assigned the value of the input integer.
