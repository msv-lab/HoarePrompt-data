Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The relevant variables here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `i_prev + 1`, where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to continue but does not change within the loop itself.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, let's update the states:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `(i_prev + 1) + 1 = i_prev + 2`.
- `n` remains the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration and must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`**.
