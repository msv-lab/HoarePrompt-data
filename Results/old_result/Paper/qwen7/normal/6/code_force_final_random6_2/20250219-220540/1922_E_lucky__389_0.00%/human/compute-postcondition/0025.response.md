Output State: **`i` is 1, `mx` is 9, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 510, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `mx`, `t`, `x`, and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
