Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with the last element being `lit[1]` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty).**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[1]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is initially 1, the list `a` now includes its previous elements plus `lit[1]`. The value of `x` remains unchanged and is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, which is now `lit[1]`. All other variables (`n`, `y`) remain unaffected by this operation.
