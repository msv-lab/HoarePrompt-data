Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter start_pos, which is an integer representing the starting position. It returns the score based on different cases:**
- If the score is determined solely by the value at index `start_pos - 1` in the array `a`.
- If the score is increased by `a[current_pos - 1]`, `visited[current_pos]` is updated, and `cycle_start` is set accordingly.
- If the score is increased by twice the value of `a[current_pos - 1]`, and `current_pos` is updated to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`.
- If the score is the initial score plus the product of full_cycles and cycle_score, plus the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration, with `current_pos` updated according to the rule `current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration.
