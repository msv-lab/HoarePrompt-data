Output State: **`a` is the first element of `nums` after calling popleft(), `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling pop(), `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is less than \(2 \times x\), `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the code, the values of the variables remain unchanged except for the fact that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
