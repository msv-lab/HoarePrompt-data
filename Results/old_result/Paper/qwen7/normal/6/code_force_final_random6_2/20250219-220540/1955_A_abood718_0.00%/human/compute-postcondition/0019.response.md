Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `A` is an integer from the input.
- `B` is an integer from the input.

The print statement `print(A * B)` will multiply the values of `A` and `B` and print the result.

Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe them as integers from the input.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers from the input)**
