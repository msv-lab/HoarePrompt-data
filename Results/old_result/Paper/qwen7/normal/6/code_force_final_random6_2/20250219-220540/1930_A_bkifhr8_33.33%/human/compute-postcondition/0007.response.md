Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This is the loop counter.
   - `n`: This is the input integer used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 (since `range(n * 2)` generates values from 0 to `n * 2 - 1`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means we need to adjust the state of `i` and `n` such that the loop condition (`i < n * 2`) is initially true.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is an input string.
- `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing because `i` is 0 and `n` must be a positive integer to satisfy the condition `i < n * 2`.
