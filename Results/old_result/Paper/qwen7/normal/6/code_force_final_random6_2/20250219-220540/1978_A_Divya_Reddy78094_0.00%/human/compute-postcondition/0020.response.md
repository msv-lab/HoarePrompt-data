Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t (number of test cases) and for each test case, an integer n (number of books) and a list of n integers representing the number of pages in each book. The function sorts the list of pages in descending order for each test case and prints the sum of the pages of the two books with the most pages. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the sum of the pages for each test case.**
