Output State: **`s` is a non-empty list, `ans` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` is [1, 0]**.

Explanation: The code increments the first element of the `cnt` list by 1. Initially, `cnt` is `[0, 0]`. After executing `cnt[c] += 1`, the value of `cnt[0]` becomes 1, while `cnt[1]` remains 0. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
