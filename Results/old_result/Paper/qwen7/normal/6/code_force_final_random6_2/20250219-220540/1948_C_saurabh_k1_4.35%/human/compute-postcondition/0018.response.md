Output State: **`t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the new input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<', `a` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads a new integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables (`t`, `b`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `t` is still within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and the condition about the string at index `n-2` in `b` not being '<' remains valid. The variable `a` is not affected by this input.
