Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is 4 - `inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)` and `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`; `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `last[i - 1]` to `inx2`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `last` or `i`, `inx2` is updated to reflect this new assignment. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
