Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a))`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition from the Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - `s` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `3`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < len(a)`.
   - Given that `i` is now `3`, the loop will continue if `3 < len(a)`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `3`.
   - `n` must still be less than `len(a)`.
   - `s` remains unchanged unless `a[3]` is compared with `a[2]` in the loop body, but since no comparison is given, `s` remains as it was.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be less than `len(a)`, and `s` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`. If `a[2]` is not greater than `a[1]`, `s` remains 0.**
