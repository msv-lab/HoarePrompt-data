Output State: **`xor` is equal to the first element of `cur_arr`, `new_arr` contains the value of `xor`, `cur_arr` contains the length reduced by one.**

Explanation: The code `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing an XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the first element of `cur_arr`. After this operation, `xor` holds the value of the first element of `cur_arr`. Since `cur_arr` has at least one element, its length is reduced by one after this operation. The value of `new_arr` remains the same as it was initially set to the value of `xor`.
