Output State: **`ii` is 4, `n` is 4, `ck` is 1**

The variable `ck` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (since it was not defined in the initial state, we assume it was 0 before this line of code). After the increment, `ck` becomes 1. The values of `ii` and `n` remain unchanged.
