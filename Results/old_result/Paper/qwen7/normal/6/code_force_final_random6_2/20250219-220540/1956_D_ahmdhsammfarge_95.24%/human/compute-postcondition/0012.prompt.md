You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers of length n, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), and ops is a list that will store the operations performed.
def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: Postcondition: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), `ops` is a list containing [[r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]], and `n` remains unchanged. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is modified such that each element is replaced by 0. Otherwise, the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` remains unchanged.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns a list 'lst' where elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) are replaced by a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each element being `l - r + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst). `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The function replaces elements in `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each element being `l - r + 1`, and returns the modified list `lst`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list 'lst' where elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) are replaced by a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each element being `l - r + 1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
