Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is 2, `s` is the original string minus the first character, `i` is the second character of the original string**.

Explanation: The value of `bc` is incremented by 1. Since `bc` was originally either 1 or 2, adding 1 to it results in `bc` becoming 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
