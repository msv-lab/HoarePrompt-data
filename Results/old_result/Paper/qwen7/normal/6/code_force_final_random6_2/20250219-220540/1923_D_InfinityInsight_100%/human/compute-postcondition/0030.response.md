Output State: `left` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 0 (since `i` will be set to 0 after the loop), `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, and `left` is updated by appending the value of the last element of `left` plus `i` in each iteration.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be set to 0 (as the loop variable `i` is redefined to 0 after the loop). The `left` list will contain the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element, as each iteration adds the current element `i` to the last element of `left`. The `last` list remains unchanged as described, containing `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`. The `ans` list remains a list of length `n` filled with -1, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run through all iterations.
