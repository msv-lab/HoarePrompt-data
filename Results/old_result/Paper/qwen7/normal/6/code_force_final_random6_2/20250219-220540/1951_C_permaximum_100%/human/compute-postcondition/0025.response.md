Output State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is the sum of its previous value and `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy` + `tickets_to_buy`, `price` is increased by `price_increase` + `tickets_to_buy` + `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy` + `tickets_to_buy`.**

This means that the `price_increase` has been updated by adding `tickets_to_buy` to its current value twice (once explicitly and once through the increment of `tickets_to_buy`). Similarly, the `price` and `tickets_bought` have also been updated by adding `tickets_to_buy` to their current values twice.
