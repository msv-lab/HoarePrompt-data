Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is now `k // 2` and must be non-zero, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (0 - 1)), -1, (1 << 0), ... , -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)], `c` is 16, `k0` is 1**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
