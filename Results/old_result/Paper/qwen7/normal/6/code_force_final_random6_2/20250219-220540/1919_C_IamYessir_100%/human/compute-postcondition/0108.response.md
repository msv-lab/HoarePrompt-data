Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 2, and `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x > y` and `y >= lit[2]`, then `b` has one more element which is `lit[2]`, and `y` is set to `lit[2]`. If `x > y` and `lit[2] > x`, then `b` has one more element which is `lit[2]`. If `x >= lit[2]` and `lit[2] > y`, then `y` is set to `lit[2]`. If `x = y`, then `a`'s last element is `lit[1]`. Otherwise, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`. If `b` is empty, `y` remains positive infinity (`float('inf')`). If `b` is not empty, `y` is updated to `lit[1]` if `lit[1]` is greater than the current `y`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged.
