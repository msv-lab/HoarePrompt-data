Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending required to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates through each test case.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of days (`n`), the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`), and the number of tickets to be bought (`k`).
3. **Price List**: It reads the list of ticket prices for each day.
4. **Priority Queue**: It uses a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the prices and their corresponding days. This helps in always processing the cheapest available tickets first.
5. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: It processes the tickets in a way that minimizes the total cost:
   - It pops the cheapest ticket from the heap.
   - It calculates how many tickets can be bought on that day without exceeding the limit `m` and the remaining tickets needed (`k`).
   - It updates the total cost and the number of tickets bought.
   - It increases the price for subsequent days by the number of tickets bought on the current day.
6. **Return Result**: Finally, it returns the total cost after processing all necessary tickets.

The logic is sound and should handle the problem as described. Therefore, the provided program is correct.
