Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `4 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `8 * y + 2 * x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - 2 * y`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, `result` is either `screen_require_for_y` or a list containing one element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.**

Explanation: The code sets `screen_require_for_y` to `y // 2`. This does not affect any other variables. The value of `screen_require_for_y` is now explicitly defined as `y // 2`, which was its previous value before the assignment. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
