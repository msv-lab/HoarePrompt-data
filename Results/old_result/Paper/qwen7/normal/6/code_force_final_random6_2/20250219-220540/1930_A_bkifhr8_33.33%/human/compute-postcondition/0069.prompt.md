Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `ans_f` contains the last computed value of `ans`, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and less than `n * 2`. If `lst` has a length not equal to 2, then `lst` has been modified by removing its element at index 2, and `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers. If `lst` has a length equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` added to its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and the second element of `lst` has been removed at index 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is either the value of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` added to its previous value (if `len(lst) != 2`), or the original value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` (if `len(lst) == 2`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
