### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the value of `n` for each test case, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - For each test case, the program generates a list `a` containing integers from `1` to `n`.
   - The list `a` is then modified such that every other element starting from the first element (even indices) is reversed. This means the elements at even indices will be in descending order while the elements at odd indices remain in ascending order.

3. **Validation**:
   - The generated permutation ensures that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) (where \(1 \leq i, j < n\) and \(i \neq j\)) exist such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).
   - For example, consider the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` transformed to `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, no pair of elements satisfies the condition where both elements divide their respective next elements.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the generated permutation for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the nature of the transformation applied to generate the permutation, the program correctly generates a valid permutation for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
