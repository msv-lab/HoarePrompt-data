Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]` and is updated, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]` and remains unchanged, `p` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 20`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the return value of the function `func_1` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `index`, which is increased by `2 * n + 20`. The value of `result` is the return value of the function call `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
