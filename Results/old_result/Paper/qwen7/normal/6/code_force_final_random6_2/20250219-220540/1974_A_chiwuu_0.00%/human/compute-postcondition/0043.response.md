Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`, `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + (a - t1) // 15**.

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated by adding `t2 // 15` to its current value. Since `t2` is defined as `a - t1`, and `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`, the new value of `t` is the original value of `t` plus `(a - t1) // 15`. Given that `t` was originally `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, the new value of `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + (a - t1) // 15`. All other variables remain unchanged.
