Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where the last element is either `float('inf')` or the original last element of the list `a`, `b` is a list with three elements where the last element is `b[2]`, and `y` is `b[2]` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 2, `lit[i]` refers to `lit[2]`, which is added to `b`. Since `b` was initially a list with two elements, after appending `lit[2]`, `b` now has three elements. The last element of `b` is now `b[2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
