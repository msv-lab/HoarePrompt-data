Output State: **`ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is a list which is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `n` must be at least 2, and `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Therefore, the values of `ii`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, `f`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `n`, and the condition `num[i] is not equal to num[i + 1]` remain unchanged.
