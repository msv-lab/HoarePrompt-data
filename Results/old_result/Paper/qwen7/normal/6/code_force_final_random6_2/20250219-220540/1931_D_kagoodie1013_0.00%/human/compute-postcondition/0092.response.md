Output State: `count` is the sum of `next_num % y` + (-next_num % x) + 2 + 1 + 3 + the sum of all `mod_x_key` values from `arr` modulo `x` + the sum of all `mod_y_key` values from `arr` modulo `y`, `arr` is an empty list, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with all keys from `arr` modulo `y` mapped to their respective counts, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with all keys from `arr` modulo `x` mapped to their respective counts, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `count` will be the sum of all `-num % x` and `num % y` values for each `num` in `arr`, plus the counts of each `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` from the elements in `arr`. The lists `arr`, `mod_y_map`, and `mod_x_map` will reflect the counts of each modulo operation performed on the elements of `arr`, and `results` will contain the final value of `count`.
