Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 in the loop head (`for i in range(len(arr))`).
   - The value of `arr` is not directly mentioned in the loop head but is used within the loop.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `len(arr)` is greater than 0 (i.e., `arr` is not an empty list).

4. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `segments_variants` is an empty list.
   - `new_segment` is an empty list.
   - `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`.
   - `max_sum` is `-1`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `arr`, we need to ensure that `arr` is not an empty list. If `arr` were empty, the loop would not execute.
   - The other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `arr` to ensure it is not an empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is not an empty list**
