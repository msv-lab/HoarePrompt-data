Output State: The loop will continue executing until `i` reaches `num2`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `num2`, and `order` will be incremented each time the condition `a[i-1] >= a[i]` is true. Therefore, `order` will count the number of times an element in the list `a` is greater than or equal to its successor.

In summary, the final output state will be a list `a` of integers, an integer `i` equal to `num2`, and an integer `order` that represents the number of adjacent pairs in the list `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element.
