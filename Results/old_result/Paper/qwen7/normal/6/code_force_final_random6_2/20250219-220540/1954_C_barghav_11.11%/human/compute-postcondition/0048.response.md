Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `a` and `b` are lists of the same length where, for each index `i`:
- If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, the element at index `i` in `a` is the maximum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`, and the element at index `i` in `b` is the minimum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`.
- If `i` is greater than half the length of `a` minus one, the element at index `i` in `a` is the minimum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`, and the element at index `i` in `b` is the maximum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`.

This means that the first half of the lists `a` and `b` will have their elements swapped such that the larger of the two values is in `a` and the smaller in `b`. The second half of the lists will have their elements swapped such that the smaller of the two values is in `a` and the larger in `b`.
