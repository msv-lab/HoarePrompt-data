Output State: **`remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `4 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `8 * y + 2 * x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `result` is a list containing two elements which are `screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y`.**

Explanation: The code `result.append(screen_require_for_y)` appends the value of `screen_require_for_y` to the list `result`. Since `result` was initially either `screen_require_for_y` or a list containing `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, after appending `screen_require_for_y`, `result` becomes a list containing two elements, both of which are `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
