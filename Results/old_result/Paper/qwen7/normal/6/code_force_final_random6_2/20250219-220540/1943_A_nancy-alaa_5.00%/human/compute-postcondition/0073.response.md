Output State: **`i` is 3 and `n` must be at least 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `i` is still 3 and `n` must still be at least 1.
