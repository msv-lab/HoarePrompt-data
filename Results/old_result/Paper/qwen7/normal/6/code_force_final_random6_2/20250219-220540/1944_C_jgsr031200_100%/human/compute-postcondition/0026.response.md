Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cou` remains 0 or becomes 1.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than -1.
   - If `freq[i]` equals 0, the values of `cou`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
   - If `freq[i]` equals 1, `cou` becomes 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`: The loop variable.
   - `n`: The upper limit of the loop.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, it stays the same.
   - The condition `n > -1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Determining the New State:**
   - `cou` will either remain 0 or become 1 based on the value of `freq[i]` from the previous iteration.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than -1.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cou` remains 0 or becomes 1, `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes `i + 1`), and `n` must still be greater than -1.**
