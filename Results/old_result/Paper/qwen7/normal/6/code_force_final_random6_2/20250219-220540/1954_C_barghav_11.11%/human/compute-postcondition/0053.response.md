Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to 1.
2. `b` is a list that must have at least 2 elements. Since the exact elements of `b` are not specified, we know it has at least two elements, but we don't know their specific values.
3. The print statement accesses `b[i]`, where `i` is 1. This means it will access the second element of the list `b`.

Given this information, we can conclude that the print statement will output the second element of the list `b`.

Output: **b[1]**
