Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `2 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `7 * y + x + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2)` if `y` is even or `15 * (y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - 2 * y`, `result` is either `screen_require_for_y` or a list containing one element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise, `x` is updated to the integer input by the user, `space_x` is updated to `x * 1` which is just `x`.**

Explanation: The line `space_x = x * 1` does not change the value of `space_x` since multiplying `x` by 1 leaves its value unchanged. All other variables remain as they were in the initial state.
