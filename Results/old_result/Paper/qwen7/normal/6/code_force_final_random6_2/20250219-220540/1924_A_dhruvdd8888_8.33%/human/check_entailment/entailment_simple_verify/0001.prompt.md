You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the main loop. This suggests a potential issue because the function should handle the logic for each test case.
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

3. **Logic Inside `func_1()`:**
   - The function initializes sets `us` and `win` to keep track of used characters and a window of characters.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if the current character is in `us`. If so, it adds the character to `win`.
   - When `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the character to `ans` and resets `win`.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `ps` (the count of characters added to `ans`) is at least `n`.
   - If `ps` is at least `n`, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a counterexample string by appending one missing character from `us` to `ans` followed by `a` repeated enough times to make the string of length `n`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Function Call Issue:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the main loop. This means the logic inside `func_1()` will not be executed for any test cases.
   - The main loop should call `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Logic for Constructing Counterexample:**
   - The logic for constructing a counterexample string is flawed. It constructs a string by appending one missing character from `us` to `ans` followed by `a` repeated enough times. However, this approach might not always produce a valid counterexample string of length `n`.

### Corrected Program:
To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the function `func_1()` is called correctly and the logic for constructing a counterexample string is improved.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        # Construct a counterexample string
        missing_chars = [c for c in us if c not in win]
        if missing_chars:
            ans.append(missing_chars[0])
            while len(ans) < n:
                ans.append('a')
            print(''.join(ans))
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical issues due to the unexecuted function `func_1()` and flawed logic for constructing a counterexample string. After fixing these issues, the program should work correctly according to the problem description.
