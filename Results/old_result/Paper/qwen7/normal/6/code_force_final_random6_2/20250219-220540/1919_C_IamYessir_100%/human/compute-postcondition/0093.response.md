Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 2. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, then `b` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `b` is `lit[2]`. Otherwise, if `lit[2] > x`, then `b` is a list with one more element than before, which is `lit[2]`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `lit[2]`.
