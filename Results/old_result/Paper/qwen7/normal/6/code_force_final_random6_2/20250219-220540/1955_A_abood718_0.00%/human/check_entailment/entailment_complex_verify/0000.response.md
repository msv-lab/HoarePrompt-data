### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `A` (number of yogurts), `B` (price for one yogurt), and `C` (price for two yogurts on promotion).

2. **Promotion Price Comparison**:
   - The program checks if `B * 2 < C`. If true, it means buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually.
   - In this case, the program prints `A * B`, which is incorrect. It should calculate the minimum cost by considering the promotion price for as many pairs as possible and then handling the remaining yogurts.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `B * 2 >= C` and `A % 2 == 0`, the program prints `int(A * C / 2)`. This is correct because it means buying all yogurts in pairs is the most cost-effective option.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `B * 2 >= C` and `A % 2 != 0`, the program calculates the cost as follows:
     - `X = A // 2`: This calculates the number of pairs of yogurts.
     - `print(X)`: This prints the number of pairs (which is incorrect; it should print the cost).
     - `print(X * C + B)`: This calculates the cost of buying `X` pairs and one additional yogurt. This part is correct.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1**: `B * 2 < C`
  - The program incorrectly prints `A * B` instead of calculating the minimum cost.
  - Correct approach: Calculate the number of pairs (`X = A // 2`) and the remaining yogurts (`Y = A % 2`). Then, the minimum cost is `X * C + Y * B`.

- **Case 2**: `B * 2 >= C` and `A % 2 == 0`
  - The program correctly prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
  - This is correct because buying all yogurts in pairs is the most cost-effective option.

- **Case 3**: `B * 2 >= C` and `A % 2 != 0`
  - The program correctly calculates the cost as `X * C + B`.
  - This is correct because it handles the remaining odd number of yogurts after buying as many pairs as possible.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**: `3 5 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10 < 11`, so the program prints `3 * 5 = 15` (incorrect).
  - Correct approach: Buy 2 yogurts at 11 and 1 yogurt at 5, total cost = 11 + 5 = 16.

- **Test Case 2**: `3 5 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10 > 9`, so the program prints `3 * 9 / 2 = 13.5` (incorrect).
  - Correct approach: Buy 2 yogurts at 9 and 1 yogurt at 5, total cost = 9 + 5 = 14.

- **Test Case 3**: `3 5 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10 < 11`, so the program prints `3 * 5 = 15` (incorrect).
  - Correct approach: Buy 2 yogurts at 11 and 1 yogurt at 5, total cost = 11 + 5 = 16.

- **Test Case 4**: `4 5 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10 < 11`, so the program prints `4 * 5 = 20` (correct).
  - Correct approach: Buy 2 yogurts at 11 and 2 yogurts at 11, total cost = 11 * 2 = 22 (incorrect).

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the scenario where buying in pairs using the promotion price is more cost-effective than buying individually, especially when the number of yogurts is odd and the promotion price for two yogurts is significantly lower than twice the individual price.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
