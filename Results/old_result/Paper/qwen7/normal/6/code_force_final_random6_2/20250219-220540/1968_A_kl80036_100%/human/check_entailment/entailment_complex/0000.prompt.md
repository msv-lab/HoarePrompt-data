Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of inputs provided minus one, `x` will be the last input integer provided where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and `y` will be `x - 1`.
    #
    #This means that if there were `n` total inputs, `i` would be `n-1`, and `y` would be the value of the last input minus one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads the values of `t` and `x`, calculates `y` as `x - 1`, and prints `y`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but leaves the program in a state where the last printed value is `x - 1` for the last test case provided.
