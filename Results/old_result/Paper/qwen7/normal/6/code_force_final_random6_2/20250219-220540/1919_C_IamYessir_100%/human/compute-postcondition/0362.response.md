Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list with the last element equal to `lit[0]`, `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), and `x` is equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 0, `a` becomes a non-empty list with its last element being `lit[0]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
