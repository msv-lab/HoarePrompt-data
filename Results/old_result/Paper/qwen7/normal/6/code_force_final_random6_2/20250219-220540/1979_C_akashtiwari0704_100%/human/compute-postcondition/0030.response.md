Output State: `bets` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `t` is 0, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their GCD when taken pairwise, `i` is the length of list `l`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `a[i-1]` for each iteration of the loop from `i=1` to `i=bets`.

In this final state, `bets` will be the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is at least 3. The variable `t` remains 0 as it was not modified within the loop. The value of `g` remains unchanged as it is defined based on the initial list `l` and does not change during the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `l`. The list `a` is modified such that each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` after each iteration. The variable `prod` also remains unchanged as it is defined based on the initial list `a` and does not change during the loop. Finally, `sumo` is the cumulative sum of the updated elements of `a` after each iteration of the loop.
