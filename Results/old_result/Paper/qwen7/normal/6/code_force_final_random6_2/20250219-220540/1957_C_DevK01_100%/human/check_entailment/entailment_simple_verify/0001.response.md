### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the problem and the solution. Let's break down the verification process step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of an \(n \times n\) chessboard after a series of valid moves by the player and the computer.
   - Each move by the player is mirrored by the computer, reducing the effective size of the board by either 2 (if the move is not mirrored) or 1 (if the move is mirrored).

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case, reading the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then iterates through the `k` moves, updating the effective size of the board based on whether the move is mirrored or not.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of possible configurations for a board of size `n` using dynamic programming.
   - The recurrence relation \(dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) is correct for computing the number of non-attacking rook placements.
   - The base cases \(dp[0] = 1\) and \(dp[1] = 1\) are also correct.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result remains within the required constraints, preventing overflow and ensuring the result is valid.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases well, such as when the board size is reduced to zero or negative values, which would not be possible in practice due to the constraints.

### Verification Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is validated by the annotated steps, showing how the `dp` array is updated correctly.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis and the validation using the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The provided solution correctly implements the logic to handle the board reductions and computes the number of possible configurations using dynamic programming.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
