Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `i + 1`, but since `i` is not explicitly given a value, it remains in this form.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The print statement simply outputs the number `2` without referencing any variables or objects.

Output: **2**
