Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 13, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. It does not affect the values of `ldb`, `rdb`, or `sz`. Therefore, these variables remain unchanged.
