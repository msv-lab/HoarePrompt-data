### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required for `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
- Each introvert needs a separate tent.
- Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others.
- Universals can share a tent with anyone.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis
- This function aims to calculate the number of tents needed for `b` extroverts and `c` universals.
- The logic checks if the remaining universals after pairing extroverts are enough to form complete groups of three.
- If `b % 3 != 0`, it checks if the remaining universals can form a complete group with the remaining extroverts.
- If the condition fails, it returns `None`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis
- This function calculates the total number of tents needed.
- It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents for `b` extroverts and `c` universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to form complete groups, and it returns `-1`.
- Otherwise, it adds the number of tents for `a` introverts to the result from `func_1`.

#### Detailed Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly handles the condition where `b` cannot be paired completely with `c`.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where `b` are more than `c` but can still form complete groups with some `c` left over. This is a critical oversight.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly uses `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for `b` extroverts and `c` universals.
   - It correctly returns `-1` if `func_1` returns `None`.
   - It correctly adds the number of tents for `a` introverts to the result from `func_1`.

#### Testing the Functions
Let's test the functions with the provided examples:

```python
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional

# Function 1
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

# Function 2
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (1, 2, 3),  # Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 2, Universals: 3 -> Tents: 3
    (1, 4, 1),  # Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 1 -> -1
    (1, 4, 2),  # Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 2 -> 3
    (1, 1, 1),  # Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 1, Universals: 1 -> -1
    (1, 3, 2),  # Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 3, Universals: 2 -> 3
    (19, 7, 18),  # Introverts: 19, Extroverts: 7, Universals: 18 -> 28
    (0, 0, 0),  # Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0 -> 0
    (7, 0, 0),  # Introverts: 7, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0 -> 7
    (0, 24, 0),  # Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 24, Universals: 0 -> 8
    (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)  # Introverts: 1000000000, Extroverts: 1000000000, Universals: 1000000000 -> 1666666667
]

for a, b, c in test_cases:
    print(f"Introverts: {a}, Extroverts: {b}, Universals: {c} -> Tents: {func_2(a, b, c)}")
```

### Expected Output

Based on the problem statement and the provided examples, the expected output should be:

```
Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 2, Universals: 3 -> Tents: 3
Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 1 -> -1
Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 2 -> 3
Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 1, Universals: 1 -> -1
Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 3, Universals: 2 -> 3
Introverts: 19, Extroverts: 7, Universals: 18 -> 28
Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0 -> 0
Introverts: 7, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0 -> 7
Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 24, Universals: 0 -> 8
Introverts: 1000000000, Extroverts: 1000000000, Universals: 1000000000 -> 1666666667
```

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed or returns `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate all participants. However, the function `func_1` has a flaw in handling the case where `b` are more than `c` but can still form complete groups with some `c` left over. This flaw is not addressed in the original assessment.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
