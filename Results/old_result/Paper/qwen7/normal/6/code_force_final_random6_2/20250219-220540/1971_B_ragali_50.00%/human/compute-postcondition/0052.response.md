Postcondition: **`s` is a string with its first half moved to the end, `i` is the last character of the new string `newstr`, `a` is a set containing each unique character from `newstr` once, `isreverse` is the reverse of the original string `s`. Regardless of whether `newstr` is equal to the original string `s` or not, these conditions hold true.**
