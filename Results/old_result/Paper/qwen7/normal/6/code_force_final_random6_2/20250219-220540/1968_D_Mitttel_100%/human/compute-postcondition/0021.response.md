Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` is `k - 1`, `vis[s]` is 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = p[s]` updates the value of `s` to `p[s]`. The other variables (`mx`, `cur`, `k`, `vis[s]`) remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `s` and retains the unchanged values of the other variables.
