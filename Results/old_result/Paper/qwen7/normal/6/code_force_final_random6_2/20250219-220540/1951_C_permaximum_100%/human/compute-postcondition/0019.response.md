Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `tickets_bought < k`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`.
   - `tickets_bought` is the sum of its previous value and `tickets_to_buy`.
   - `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.
   - `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `tickets_bought < k`.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k` at the start of the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `tickets_bought` is the sum of its previous value and `tickets_to_buy`.
- `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k` at the start of the next iteration. This means that `tickets_bought` should be adjusted to be less than `k`.

Since `tickets_to_buy` is determined based on the values of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, we need to ensure that `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy` is still less than `k` at the start of the next iteration.

To achieve this, we need to ensure that `tickets_to_buy` is set such that adding it to `tickets_bought` keeps the total less than `k`.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- Ensure `tickets_bought` is less than `k` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is the sum of its previous value and `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, and `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`**.
