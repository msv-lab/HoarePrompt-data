Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_1` function performs a binary search, but it does not check if the target value `x` is actually present in the permutation. This is a critical oversight because the problem requires rearranging the permutation such that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The function only checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the array. If `l` is already equal to the index of `x`, it prints `0` and returns without performing any swaps. However, the problem statement specifies that the elements at the specified indices should be swapped no more than 2 times to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.

3. **Example Analysis**: Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
   - **Input:**
     ```
     1
     6 3
     1 2 4 5 6 3
     ```
   - **Expected Output:**
     ```
     1
     5 6
     ```
   - **Actual Output:**
     ```
     0
     ```
   The actual output is incorrect because the element `3` is present in the permutation, and it should be swapped with another element to make `p_l` equal to `3`.

4. **Functionality Check**: The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the element `x` is not present in the permutation. It assumes that `x` is always present, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the required functionality and fails to handle cases where the target element is not present in the permutation.

Final: **False**
