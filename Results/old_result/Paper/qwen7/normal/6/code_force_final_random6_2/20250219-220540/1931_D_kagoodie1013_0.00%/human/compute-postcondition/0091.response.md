Output State: `count` is the sum of `next_num % y`, `-next_num % x`, and the cumulative counts from the previous iterations (2 + 1 + 3), `arr` is an empty list, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 4, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 1.

In this final state, `count` accumulates the contributions from each iteration of the loop. The loop has processed all elements in `arr`, and now `arr` is empty. The `mod_y_map` and `mod_x_map` dictionaries reflect the counts of remainders for both `-num % x` and `num % y` operations across all elements processed. The `results` list contains the final value of `count`.
