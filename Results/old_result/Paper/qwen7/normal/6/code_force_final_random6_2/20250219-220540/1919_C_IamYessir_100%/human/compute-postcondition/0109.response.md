Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 2, and `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x` is greater than `y` and `y` is less than `lit[2]`, then `b` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `b` is `lit[2]`. If `x` is not greater than `y` and `lit[2] > x`, then `b` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `b` is `lit[2]`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `lit[2]`. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` is a list with its last element being `lit[1]`. Otherwise, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` remains positive infinity (`float('inf')`). If `b` is not empty, `y` is updated to `lit[1]` if it is greater than the current `y`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged.
