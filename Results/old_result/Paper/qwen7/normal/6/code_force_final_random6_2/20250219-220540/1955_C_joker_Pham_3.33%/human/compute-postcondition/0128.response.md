Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2] - 2 * a[l]\) or \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[l]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `r - 1`, `r` is `n - 4`, `sunks` is either 5, 6, 7, 7, or 8, `a[n-3]` is decreased by `a[n-1]` if `a[r]` is not zero.**
