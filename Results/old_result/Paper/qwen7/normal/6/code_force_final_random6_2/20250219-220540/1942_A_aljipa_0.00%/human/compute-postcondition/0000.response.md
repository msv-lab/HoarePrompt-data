Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. The other variables `n` and `k` are not defined or modified in this code snippet, so their initial conditions remain unchanged.
