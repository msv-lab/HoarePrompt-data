Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` remains the same as the previous iteration, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the `ans` variable was being updated. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the `break` statement indicates that we have exited the loop or conditional block.
