Output State: **`a` is the first element of `nums` after calling popleft(), `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling pop(), `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

The code assigns the minimum value between `a` and `b` to `x`. Since `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()` and `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `x` is now set to the smaller of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
