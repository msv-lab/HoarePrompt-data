Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` contains at least one fewer element than before.
- `elem` is the element that was just processed from `ldb`.
- `sz` is either incremented by 2 or remains unchanged depending on the condition `k - sz >= 2`.
- If the condition `sz >= k` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of what it represents.

Output: **elem elem**
