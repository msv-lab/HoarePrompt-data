Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and two binary strings \( s1 \) and \( s2 \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of box flips required to transform the initial state represented by \( s1 \) into the desired state represented by \( s2 \). A box flip changes all '0's to '1's and all '1's to '0's within the box. The function outputs the total count of such flips needed for each test case.**
