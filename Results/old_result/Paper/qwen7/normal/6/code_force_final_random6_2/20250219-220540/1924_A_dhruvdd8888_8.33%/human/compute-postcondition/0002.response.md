Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a'.**

Explanation: The code creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a'. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
