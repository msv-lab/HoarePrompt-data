Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations. For each iteration, `a` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, and `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`. After all iterations, `num_iterations` equals the total number of test cases processed, and both `a` and `s` are reset to the values of the last test case's input integer and string, respectively. The final printed value is the sum of `x` and `y` minus `z` for the last input string `s`.
