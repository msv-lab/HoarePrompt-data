Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `space_x = x * 1` assigns the value of `x` to `space_x`. Since multiplying `x` by 1 does not change its value, `space_x` is simply set to the value of `x`. The conditions and values of `n` and `y` remain unchanged.
