Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, where n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the price for one yogurt, and b is the price for two yogurts on promotion.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
    if B * 2 < C:
        print(A * B)
    elif A % 2 == 0:
        print(int(A * C / 2))
    else:
        X = A // 2
        print(X)
        print(X * C + B)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, the postcondition remains as the precondition. Otherwise, if `A` is even, `A` remains unchanged. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A` divided by 2, and `B` and `C` satisfy the condition `B * 2 >= C`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `A` is an integer from the input, `B` is an integer from the input, `C` is an integer from the input. If `B * 2 < C`, the postcondition remains the same. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the postcondition also remains the same. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `A` is an input integer, `B` is an input integer, `C` is an input integer, and if `B * 2 < C`, then the postcondition remains as the initial state. If `B * 2 >= C`, and if `A` is even, `X` is set to `A // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
