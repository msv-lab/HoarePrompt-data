Output State: **`bullets_used` is 0, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3 â‹… 10^4.**

Explanation: The code initializes `bullets_used` to 0. This means that no bullets have been used yet. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
