Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\) reduced by \(2 \times a[l]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `sunks` is equal to 2, and `l` is increased by 1.**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their original values or conditions specified in the initial state.
