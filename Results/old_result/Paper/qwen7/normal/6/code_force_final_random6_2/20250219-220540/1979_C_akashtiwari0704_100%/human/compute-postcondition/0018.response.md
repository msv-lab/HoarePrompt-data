Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) when taken pairwise, `i` is the length of list `l`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `prod = lcm(a)` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `prod`. The other variables (`bets`, `t`, `g`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
