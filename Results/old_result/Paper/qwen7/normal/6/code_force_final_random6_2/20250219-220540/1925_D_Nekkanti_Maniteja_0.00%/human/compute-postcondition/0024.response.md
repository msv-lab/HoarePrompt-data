Output State: `i` is 100000, `k` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations (which is 100000), and `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from 99999 to 100000.

In more detail, after the loop executes all 100000 iterations, the variable `i` will be 100000 because the loop increments `i` starting from 99999. The variable `k` must be at least 100000 to allow the loop to run through all iterations. The variable `s` will be the cumulative sum of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each value of `i` from 99999 up to 100000, inclusive.
