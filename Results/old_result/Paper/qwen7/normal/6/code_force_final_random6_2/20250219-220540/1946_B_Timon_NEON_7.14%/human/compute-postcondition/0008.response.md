Output State: **`i` is 0, `arr` is a non-empty list, and the new_segment is True; segments_variants contains [max_segment + [-1]].**

Explanation: The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is formed by adding `-1` (which is `i - 1` given that `i` is 0) to `max_segment`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
