Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the position of the number `x` in the permutation `array` using at most 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly.
2. The annotated program attempts to solve this by performing a binary search on the array and then checking if the result of the binary search matches the expected position of `x`.
3. The binary search logic is flawed because it does not actually place `x` in the correct position in the array. Instead, it prints the index of `x` directly if `l` equals the index of `x`, which does not solve the problem as stated.
4. The solution should involve identifying the correct indices to swap to ensure that the binary search will eventually find `x` at the correct position `l`.
5. The provided code only checks if `l` is equal to the index of `x` and swaps once if they are not equal, but it does not guarantee that the binary search will work correctly afterward.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the required solution. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
