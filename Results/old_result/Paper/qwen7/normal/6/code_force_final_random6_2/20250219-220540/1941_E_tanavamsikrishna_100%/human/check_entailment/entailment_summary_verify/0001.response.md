### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness and verify the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`

1. **Initialization:**
   - The first support cost is set to 1.
   - The first `d` cells are incremented by 2 to account for the additional cost of placing supports next to the river banks.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A min heap is created from the first `d` cells, ensuring the smallest cost is always at the top.

3. **Processing Remaining Cells:**
   - For each subsequent cell, the heap is processed to remove elements that do not satisfy the distance constraint (`i - (d + 2)`).
   - The current cell's cost is updated to the minimum cost found in the heap plus the current cell's value plus 1.
   - The updated cost and index are pushed back into the heap.

4. **Return the Last Cost:**
   - The cost of the last cell is returned, representing the minimum cost to install supports in the row.

The logic in `func_1` seems correct and efficient for calculating the minimum cost for a single row.

#### Function `func_2`

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are read.
   - The river grid `rows` is parsed.

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Row:**
   - The `func_1` function is applied to each row to calculate the minimum cost for installing supports.

3. **Calculate Total Costs for Consecutive Rows:**
   - The costs for each row are stored in the `costs` list.
   - The minimum cost for any `k` consecutive rows is calculated by iterating through the `costs` list and finding the minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements.

4. **Output the Minimum Cost:**
   - The minimum total cost is printed.

The logic in `func_2` also appears to be correct and follows the problem constraints accurately.

### Verification

1. **Heap Usage:**
   - The heap is used efficiently to keep track of the minimum cost up to a certain distance, ensuring the distance constraint is maintained.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation logic in `func_1` correctly ensures that the distance between supports is no more than `d` and minimizes the overall cost.

3. **Consecutive Rows:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly iterates through the rows and finds the minimum cost for any `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as the first and last cells being fixed at 0 and the distance constraint being enforced.

### Conclusion

After re-analyzing the program, the logic implemented in both functions is correct and follows the problem constraints accurately. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
