Output State: **`ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')`, `i` is `n-1`, the loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n-1`, the value of `n` must be greater than 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `arr[i]` must not be equal to `arr[i-1]`, the variable `flag` remains `False` throughout the entire loop execution.**

This means that the variable `ans` has been set to `Decimal('Infinity')`, which is its new value. All other conditions and values remain as they were before the assignment, including the loop's state and the values of `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `flag`.
