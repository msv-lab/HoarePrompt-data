Output State: **`left` is a list containing 0, `last` is a list containing -1 and -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the last element of the `last` list to itself, making the `last` list contain both the original value (-1) and the newly appended value (-1). All other variables remain unchanged.
