Output State: **`t` is 0, `g` is (l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])) * l[3] // gcd((l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])) * l[3] // gcd((l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])) * l[3] // gcd(...), l[i]), `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 3**

Explanation: 
- The value of `t` remains unchanged at 0.
- The value of `g` is updated to `(l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])) * l[3] // gcd((l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])) * l[3] // gcd(...), l[i])`. Here, `i` is 3, so `g` is updated to include `l[3]` and the greatest common divisor (gcd) is taken between the current value of `g` and `l[3]`.
- The value of `i` is incremented to 3.
- The list `l` must still have at least 1 element for the loop to continue.
