Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`; `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r`. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` and `r`, and no specific value for `i` is given beyond it being `n + 2`, we can only state that `i` is now `n + 2` and that `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged as no specific operation was performed on it.
