Output State: **`cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` remains `n-1`, `n` must still be greater than 1, and the value of `arr[i]` is still equal to `val`.
