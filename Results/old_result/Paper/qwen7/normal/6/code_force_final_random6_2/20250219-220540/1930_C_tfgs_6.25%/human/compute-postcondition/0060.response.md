Output State: **`ans` now contains the elements `a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1`, `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`; `a` retains its original value; `j` is now `j + 3`; `cnt` is decreased by `adv`.**

This means that the value of `cnt` has been decreased by the value of `adv`, while the other variables (`ans`, `a`, and `j`) retain their previous states.
