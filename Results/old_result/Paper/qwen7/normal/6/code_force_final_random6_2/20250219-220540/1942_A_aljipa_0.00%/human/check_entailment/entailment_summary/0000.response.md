Reasoning:
1. The program needs to generate arrays that meet specific criteria based on the values of \(n\) and \(k\).
2. The program handles three main cases:
   - When \(k = n\): It generates an array of \(n\) ones.
   - When \(k = 1\): It generates a range of integers from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - Otherwise: It returns \([-1]\).

3. Let's check if these cases correctly fulfill the requirements:
   - For \(k = n\): An array of \(n\) ones will always be sorted in every cyclic shift because all elements are the same.
   - For \(k = 1\): A range of integers from 0 to \(n-1\) will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift (when the smallest element is at the beginning).
   - For other values of \(k\): The array \([-1]\) is used, which correctly indicates that no valid array exists for those conditions.

4. The program correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.

Given this analysis, the program appears to handle the problem correctly according to the provided logic.

Correctness: **True**
