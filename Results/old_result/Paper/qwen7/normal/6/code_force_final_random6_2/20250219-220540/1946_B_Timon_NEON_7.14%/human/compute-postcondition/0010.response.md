Output State: **`i` is 0; `arr` is a non-empty list; the new_segment is True; segments_variants contains `[True, -1]`; the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a list containing `new_segment` (which is `True`) and `i - 1` (which is `-1` since `i` is `0`) to the `segments_variants` list. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0 is still valid.
