Output State: **`segments_variants` contains at least one element, `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`, and `total_max_segment` is equal to `segment`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`. The state of `segments_variants` and the value of `segment` remain unchanged.
