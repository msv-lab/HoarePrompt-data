Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is not directly affected by the given code snippet, so it remains valid.
