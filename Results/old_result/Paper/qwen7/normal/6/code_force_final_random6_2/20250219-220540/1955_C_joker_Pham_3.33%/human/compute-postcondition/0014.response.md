Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
