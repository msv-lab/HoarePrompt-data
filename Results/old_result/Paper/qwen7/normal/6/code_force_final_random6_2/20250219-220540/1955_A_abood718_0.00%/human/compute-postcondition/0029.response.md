Output State: **`i` is 2, `A` is an input integer, `B` is an input integer, `C` is an input integer**

The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still set to 2.
