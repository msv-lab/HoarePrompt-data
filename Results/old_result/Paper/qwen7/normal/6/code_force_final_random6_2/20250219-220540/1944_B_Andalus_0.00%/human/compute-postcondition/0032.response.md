Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, `sng` has the element `lft[4]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[4]` to the list `sng`. Since `i` is 4, the index used to access `lft` is 4. The value of `n` and the existence of `sng` as a list are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, `n` remains greater than 3, and `sng` now includes the element `lft[4]` in addition to any other elements it may have had previously.
