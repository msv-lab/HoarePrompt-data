Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is 3, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element of `sng`.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains at least one element, `sz` is 5, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the value of `sz` is increased by 2. If `k - sz` is less than 2, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains at least one element (excluding the one processed in the current iteration), `sz` is either 5 or 7, and `sng` must contain at least two elements. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` becomes 7. Otherwise, `sz` remains 5.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains at least one less element than before, `sz` is either 5 or 7, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` becomes 9. Otherwise, `sz` remains either 5 or 7.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
