Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1 or 2.
   - `arr` is a non-empty list.
   - `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum of the original `max_segment[0]` and `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`.
   - `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative.

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 or 2, the next value of `i` would be 2 or 3 respectively.
   - The list `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `max_segment[0]` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (either 2 or 3).
   - `new_segment` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (either 2 or 3).

Given that `i` can be either 1 or 2, let's consider both cases:

- If `i` was 1, then the next value of `i` will be 2.
- If `i` was 2, then the next value of `i` will be 3.

Since `i` can be either 1 or 2, we need to consider the general case where `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was 1, it becomes 2; if `i` was 2, it becomes 3.
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `max_segment[0]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `new_segment` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum of the original `max_segment[0]` and `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, and `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative.**
