Output State: **`a` must have a length of at least 6, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 0 if the substring `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 is neither 'map' nor 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1, `i` is 4, `s` is updated to be the substring of `a` starting from index 4 and having a length of 3.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 3 if the substring `s` was 'map' or 'pie', and 1 otherwise. After incrementing `i`, `i` becomes 4. The conditions for `ans` and `s` remain unchanged because the code only modifies `i`.
