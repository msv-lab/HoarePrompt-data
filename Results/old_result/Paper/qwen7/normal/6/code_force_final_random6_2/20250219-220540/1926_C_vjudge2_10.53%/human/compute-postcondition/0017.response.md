Output State: **`i` is 0; `values` is a list with one element 0**.

Explanation: The line `values[i] = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to the index `i` in the list `values`. Since `i` is 0, the first element of the list `values` is set to 0. The value of `i` itself does not change, so it remains 0.
