Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `cnt` retains its final value after the last iteration, `ans` is updated to the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, and `flag` remains `False` throughout the entire loop execution.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `flag`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously mentioned states.
