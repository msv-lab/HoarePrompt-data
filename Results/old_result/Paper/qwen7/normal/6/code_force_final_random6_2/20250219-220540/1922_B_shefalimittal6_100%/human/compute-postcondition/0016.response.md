Output State: **`idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**.

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `x`, and `v[x]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided. Therefore, `idx` is increased by 1, and `v[x]` is incremented by 1.
