Output State: **`ldb` contains at least one fewer element than before, `elem` is the element that was just processed from `ldb`, `sz` is incremented by 2, and the condition `sz >= k` is either true or false depending on the initial value of `sz` and `k`.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 2` increments the value of `sz` by 2. The conditions related to `ldb` and `elem` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The condition `sz >= k` is evaluated based on the new value of `sz`, which is the original value of `sz` plus 2.
