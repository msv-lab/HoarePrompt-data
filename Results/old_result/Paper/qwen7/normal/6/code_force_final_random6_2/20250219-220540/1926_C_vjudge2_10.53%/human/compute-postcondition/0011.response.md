Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000, `n` is the integer value of the final input, and `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the integer value of one of the inputs provided during the loop iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be the initial value of the loop (the number of times the loop runs), `n` will be the last integer input provided, and `numbers` will be a list of length `t`, where each element is an integer input from the user corresponding to each iteration of the loop.
