Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, and the values of these variables remain unchanged regardless of whether `n` equals 2 or not. Additionally, if `n` does not equal 2, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, or if `count_1` is even and the string `s` contains exactly one instance of '11', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
