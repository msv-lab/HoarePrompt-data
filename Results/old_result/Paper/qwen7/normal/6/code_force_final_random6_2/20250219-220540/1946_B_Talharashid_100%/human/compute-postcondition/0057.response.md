Output State: **`l` is a list with at least one element (excluding the current `ele`), `c` is 0, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and abs(`ele`).**

Explanation: The code sets `c` to 0, which resets its value. The value of `maxi` is determined based on the previous value of `c` and the absolute value of `ele`. Since `c` was previously increased by the value of `ele`, `maxi` retains the maximum value between the previous `c` and `abs(ele)`. The list `l` and the variable `ele` remain unchanged from their initial state.
