Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to either the sum of `max_segment[0]` and `arr[0]` if `arr[0] < 0`, or the original value of `max_segment[0]` plus the first element of `arr` if `arr[0] >= 0`, and `new_segment[0]` is either an empty list if `arr[0] < 0` or the first element of `arr` if `arr[0] >= 0`, or `new_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `i` is 1, or `new_segment` remains False if `arr[0]` is less than 0 and `i` is 1.
