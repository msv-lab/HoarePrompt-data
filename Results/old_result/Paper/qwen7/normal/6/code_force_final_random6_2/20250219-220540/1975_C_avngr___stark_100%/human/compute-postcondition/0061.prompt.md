Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is 3, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is 0, `n - 2` is 1, and `i` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    temp = a[i:i + 3]
    temp.sort()
    if temp[1] > max:
        max = temp[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `temp` is [0, 1, 3], `i` is 0, `n` is 3, `n - 2` is 1, and if `temp[1]` (which is 1) is greater than `max` (which is also 1), the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged since there is no else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `temp` is [1, 3, 3], `i` is 1, and `max` remains 3 since the condition `temp[1] > max` is false, so the else part does not execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `temp` is [1, 3, 3], `i` is 2. If `max` is less than 3, the function does nothing. If `max` is greater than or equal to 3, the function also does nothing.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
