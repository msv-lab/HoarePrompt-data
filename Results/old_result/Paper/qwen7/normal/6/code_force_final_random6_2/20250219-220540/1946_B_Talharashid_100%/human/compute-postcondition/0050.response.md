Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous `maxi`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is assigned the value 0. The value of `maxi` remains unchanged as it is defined as the maximum of `c` (which is now 0) and the previous `maxi`. Therefore, `maxi` is still the maximum of 0 and whatever its previous value was.
