Output State: **`v` is 0; `u` is a value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, `d` is `n-1`, and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**

Explanation: The line `path.append(v)` appends the value of `v` (which is 0) to the list `path`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
