Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first part of the split function applied to the output of `func_1()` to an integer, `c` is a string obtained from the second part of the split function applied to the output of `func_1()`, `temp` is a new empty set.**

The code initializes `temp` as an empty set. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
