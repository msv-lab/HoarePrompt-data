Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in vals`.
   - The variable `x` is the iterator that goes through each element in the list `vals`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `vals` is a list of `N` integers.
   - `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)` where `x` is the second element of `vals`, and `den` is updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)`.

3. **Understand what happens in the loop**:
   - In each iteration, `x` takes the value of the next element in `vals`.
   - `den` is updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the second element of `vals` at the end of the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `x` will be the third element of `vals`.
   - `den` will be updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)` where `x` is now the third element of `vals`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `N` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
   - `vals` remains the same list of `N` integers.
   - `den` will be updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)` where `x` is now the third element of `vals`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of `N` integers, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)` where `x` is the third element of `vals`**
