### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or not swap wallets but must always remove one coin from their own wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to win.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `if a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

3. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - If `a + b` is even, the total number of coins is even.
     - In such a scenario, the player whose turn it is will always be able to force the other player into a position where they have an odd number of coins.
     - This means that the player who starts (Alice) will eventually be forced to have 0 coins in their wallet first, leading to a loss.
   - If `a + b` is odd, the total number of coins is odd.
     - Here, the player whose turn it is will always be able to force the other player into a position where they have an even number of coins.
     - This means that the player who starts (Alice) can always ensure that she does not lose until the very end, allowing her to win.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the given program correctly determines the winner based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - The program matches the optimal strategy analysis provided in the problem description.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program's implementation. The program does not simulate the actual game moves; instead, it simply checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. While this works for the given problem, it does not accurately reflect the game dynamics. Specifically, the program assumes that the player who starts (Alice) will always lose if the sum is even, which is not necessarily true in all scenarios.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- If Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 3 coins (`a = 1`, `b = 3`), the sum is even (`1 + 3 = 4`). According to the program, Bob would win. However, let's simulate the game:
  - Alice swaps wallets (now Alice has 3 coins, Bob has 1 coin).
  - Bob removes 1 coin (now Alice has 3 coins, Bob has 0 coins).
  - Alice cannot make a valid move (her wallet has 3 coins).

In this case, Alice wins, which contradicts the program's output.

Therefore, while the program's logic is correct in determining the winner based on the parity of the sum, it does not fully capture the game dynamics and could lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not entirely correct because it does not simulate the actual game moves and could produce incorrect results in some scenarios.
