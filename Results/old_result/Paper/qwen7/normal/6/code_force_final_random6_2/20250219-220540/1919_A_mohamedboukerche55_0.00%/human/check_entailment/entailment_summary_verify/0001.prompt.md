You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing three positive integers: `t`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it reads `t` pairs of integers `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and prints 'bob' if the sum is even, or 'alice' if the sum is odd. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints 'bob' or 'alice' for each pair of integers `a` and `b` based on the parity of their sum.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. Both players take turns, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key observation here is that the game essentially revolves around the parity (even or odd nature) of the total number of coins.

2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob will always win if both players play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally.

3. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints the corresponding winner.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and checks its parity.
   - Based on the parity, it prints the correct winner ("bob" or "alice").
   - The logic is consistent with the problem statement and the examples provided.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.
