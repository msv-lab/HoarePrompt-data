Output State: **`monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `pos` is the second element of the next tuple in the list, `health` is the first element of the next tuple in the list, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `bullets_used` is increased by `health`**.

Explanation: The code `distance = abs(pos)` simply calculates the absolute value of `pos` and assigns it to `distance`. It does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the state of `monsters`, `pos`, `health`, `total_bullets_needed`, and `bullets_used` remains unchanged except that `distance` is now set to the absolute value of `pos`.
