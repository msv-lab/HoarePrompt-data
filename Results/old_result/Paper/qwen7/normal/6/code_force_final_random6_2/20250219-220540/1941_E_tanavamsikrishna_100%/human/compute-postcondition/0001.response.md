Output State: **`rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values; `d` retains its original value; `costs` is not yet defined; `total_costs` is not yet defined.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` lines of space-separated integers and constructs the `rows` list accordingly. Each inner list in `rows` contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are explicitly set to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, and the variables `costs` and `total_costs` are not yet defined as they depend on further code execution.
