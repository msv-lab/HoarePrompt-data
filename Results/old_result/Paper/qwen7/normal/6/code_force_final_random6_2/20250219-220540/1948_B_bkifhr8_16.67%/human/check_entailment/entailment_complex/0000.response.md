Reasoning:
1. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and performing the specified operation whenever an element greater than 10 is found and is out of order with the previous element.
2. However, the logic for performing the operation is flawed. Specifically, the code snippet inside the loop where it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the list is not correctly implemented.
3. The provided `func_1` function checks if the list is already sorted but does not actually perform any operations to sort the list.
4. The main issue is that the program does not attempt to perform the required operations to potentially sort the list. Instead, it only checks if the list is already sorted, which is insufficient for solving the problem as stated.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to perform the necessary operations to transform the array into a sorted one.

Correctness: **False**
