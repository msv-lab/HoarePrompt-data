State: **`left` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 1, `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine Initial Values Needed for Loop Execution**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop definition (`for i in range(1, n):`).
   - The loop condition `range(1, n)` means `i` will iterate from 1 to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be 1 at the start of the loop for the first iteration to occur.
3. **Adjust Other States**:
   - The states of `left`, `last`, `ans`, `a`, and `n` do not change based on the loop head alone but are part of the overall program state. They are not directly adjusted by the loop head but should be consistent with the problem description.

Thus, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute correctly is `i` to be 1. The other states remain as described in the problem statement.
