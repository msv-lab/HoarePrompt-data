Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 0, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is 0, `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + ans[i]` and `ans[i + 1]` is updated to be `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Given the initial conditions, `ans[i + 1]` was already set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. After executing `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]`, the new value of `ans[i + 1]` becomes `(arr[i] + ans[i]) + ans[i]`, which simplifies to `arr[i] + 2 * ans[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
