Output State: `t` is 0, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) when taken pairwise, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the length of list `l`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `g` will hold the value of the product of all elements in the list `l`, divided by the GCD of each pair of elements in the list, starting from the first element. The variable `t` remains 0, `l` remains the same list it started with, and `i` will be equal to the length of the list `l`.
