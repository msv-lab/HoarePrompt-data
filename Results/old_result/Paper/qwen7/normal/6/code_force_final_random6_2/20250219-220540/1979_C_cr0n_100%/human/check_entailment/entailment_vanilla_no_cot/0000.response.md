Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `den`**: The program calculates `den` as the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers `k_i`. However, the goal is to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The LCM calculation alone does not guarantee this condition.

2. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: The program then divides `den` by each `k_i` to get `vprod`, which it prints as the distribution of coins. This approach does not necessarily ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where distributing the coins as required is impossible. For example, if all `k_i` are the same, the only way to satisfy the condition would be to bet zero coins, which is not allowed by the problem constraints.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to find a way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. One possible approach is to use a greedy strategy where you bet the smallest possible amount on each outcome while ensuring the total bet is strictly less than the minimum `k_i`.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    
    min_k = min(vals)
    total_bet = 0
    
    # Distribute coins greedily
    for k in vals:
        if k == min_k:
            break
        total_bet += min_k - 1
        min_k -= 1
    
    if total_bet >= min_k:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(str(min_k - 1) for _ in range(N)))

# Example usage
func_2()
```

This approach ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the minimum `k_i`, thus satisfying the problem requirements.
