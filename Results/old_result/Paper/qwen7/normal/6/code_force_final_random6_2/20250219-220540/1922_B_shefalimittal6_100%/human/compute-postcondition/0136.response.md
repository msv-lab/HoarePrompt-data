Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, and `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, and if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is further increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by `v[i]`. The conditions for updating `ans` remain unchanged, meaning if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, and if `v[i]` is also greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is further increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. The variable `i` remains set to `n`.
