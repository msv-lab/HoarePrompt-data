Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments by 2 each time until `i` is no longer less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is 3 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `i` is 1 (this is part of the loop head and will be updated).
   - `p[1]` is 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `1 + 2 = 3`.

5. **Determine the new value of `n`**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1, so `n` must be greater than 1. However, since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ind` is 3, `i` is 3, `p[1]` is 1, `n` must be greater than 3**
