Output State: The value of `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `n` is even, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the last input, and `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the last input. The string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<'. The loop has executed for all test cases provided, and for each test case, if the condition `b[n-2] != '<'` was met, it printed 'Yes', otherwise it printed 'No'.
