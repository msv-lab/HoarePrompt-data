Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is now an integer, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is now an integer, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`**.

Explanation: The code `b = int(b)` converts the string `b` into an integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `b` changes its type to integer while keeping its value as an integer, and the rest of the variables retain their initial conditions.
