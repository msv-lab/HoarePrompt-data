Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `cnt` is undefined, `ans` is `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Since `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, the condition for updating `ans` based on `cnt` does not apply here. Therefore, `ans` is updated according to the new expression. The values of `i` and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
