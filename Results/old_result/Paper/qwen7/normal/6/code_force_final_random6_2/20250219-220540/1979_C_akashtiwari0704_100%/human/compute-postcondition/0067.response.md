Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `bets - 1`.
   - The loop head does not explicitly mention `sumo` or `a[i]`, but these are modified within the loop body.

2. **Determine the changes made in the loop body:**
   - `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`.
   - `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `bets`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states:**
   - `sumo` is updated based on `a[i]`, so we need to know the new value of `sumo` after the update.
   - `a[i]` is updated, so we need to know the new value of `a[i]`.
   - `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - Since `i` was previously some value (let's call it `prev_i`), for the next iteration, `i` will be `prev_i + 1`.
   - `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[prev_i]`, so the new value of `sumo` is `sumo + a[prev_i]`.
   - `a[prev_i]` is updated to `prod // a[prev_i]`, so the new value of `a[prev_i]` is `prod // a[prev_i]`.

Given the information, let's assume the previous values were:
- `sumo` was 15
- `a[i]` was 5
- `prod` was 100
- `i` was 2
- `bets` was 5

After the previous iteration:
- `sumo` is increased by 5, so `sumo` is now 20.
- `a[i]` is updated to `100 // 5 = 20`.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to 3.
- `sumo` will be 20.
- `a[2]` will be 20.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`sumo` is 20, `a[i]` is 20, `i` is 3, `bets` is 5**
