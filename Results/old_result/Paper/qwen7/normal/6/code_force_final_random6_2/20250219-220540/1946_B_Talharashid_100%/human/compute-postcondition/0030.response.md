Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is an empty list, `c` is the final cumulative value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, and `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and the value of `c` when `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)` is false, or 0 when it is true.**

Explanation: The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. Since `c` is the final cumulative value calculated within the loop, and `maxi` keeps track of the highest value of `c` under the specified conditions during the loop's execution, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with only `maxi` being updated to reflect the maximum value of `c` that meets the condition `ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele)` being false.
