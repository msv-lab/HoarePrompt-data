Output State: **`ls` is 0 + the first element of `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ls += nums[i]` increments `ls` by the value of `nums[i]`. Since `i` is 0, `ls` is incremented by the first element of `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `ls` is the sum of its original value (0) and the first element of `nums`. The list `nums` and the index `i` remain as they were initially.
