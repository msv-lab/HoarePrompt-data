Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `PB` is updated to the integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 26`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is updated to the integer from `data[index + 3]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1`, `p` is updated to a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by 4, `index` is increased by `n`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `n`**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. The result of this function call is stored in the variable `result`. This result is also added to the `results` list. Additionally, the list `p` is updated to a new list of integers extracted from `data` starting at the current index and ending just before the next increment of `index`. The `index` is then incremented by 4, followed by `n`, and finally `n` again. All other variables retain their previous values.
