Output State: **`bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is True, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `bullets_used + health` to `total_bullets_needed`. Since `bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` is simply `health`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
