Output State: **`left` is a list containing 0; `last` is a list containing -1; `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `ans` with `-1` repeated `n` times. The length of `ans` is determined by the variable `n`, which is not specified in the initial state. The values of `left` and `last` remain unchanged from their initial states.
