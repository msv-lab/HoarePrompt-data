Output State: **`xor` is 0; `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr` appended to it; `cur_arr` must have a length of at least 1.**

Explanation: The initial state sets `xor` to the first element of `cur_arr`, `new_arr` to contain the first element of `cur_arr`, and ensures `cur_arr` has a length of at least 1. The code snippet `xor = 0` changes the value of `xor` to 0 while keeping the values of `new_arr` and `cur_arr` unchanged.
