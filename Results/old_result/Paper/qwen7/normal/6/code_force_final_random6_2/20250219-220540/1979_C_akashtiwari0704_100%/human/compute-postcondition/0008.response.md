Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = len(l) - 1`. This means that the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`
   - `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element
   - `i` is 2

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The list `l` must still have at least 1 element for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `g` remains unchanged as it is derived from the initial values of `l[0]` and `l[1]`.
   - `i` is incremented to 3.
   - `l` must still have at least 1 element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is 0, `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 3**
