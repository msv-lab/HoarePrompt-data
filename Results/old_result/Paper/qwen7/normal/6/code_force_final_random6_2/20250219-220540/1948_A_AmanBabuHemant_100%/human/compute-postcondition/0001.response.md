State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. Since `t` is constrained to be between 1 and 50 (inclusive), the valid range for `t` is from 1 to 50.
4. Therefore, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure it falls within this valid range.

Thus, the state must be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
