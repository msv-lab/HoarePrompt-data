Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`
   - `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`
   - `path` is a list containing 0 and `v`
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`
   - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `d`.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, meaning it starts from `n-1` and decrements down to 0.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `d` must be greater than 0 (since the loop stops when `d` reaches -1).

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `d`.
   - Since the loop starts from `n-1` and decrements, the initial value of `d` at the start of the first iteration would be `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `d` must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `d` was decremented by 1 from its initial value.
- If the loop is to execute again, `d` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `d` is `n-2` (assuming it started from `n-1` and was decremented once).

So, the updated state is:
State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0 and `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`, and `d` is `n-2`**.
