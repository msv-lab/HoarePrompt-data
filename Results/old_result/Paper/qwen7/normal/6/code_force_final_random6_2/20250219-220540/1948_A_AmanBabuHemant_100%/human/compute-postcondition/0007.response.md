Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an input integer, and `n` is even; `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value `'AAB' * (n // 2)`. This means `s` is a string that consists of the substring `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
