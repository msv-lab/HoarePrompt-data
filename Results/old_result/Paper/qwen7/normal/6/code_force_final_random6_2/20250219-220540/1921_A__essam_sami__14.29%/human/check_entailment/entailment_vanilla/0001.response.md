Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly computes the area of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates `(a, b)`, `(c, d)`, `(e, f)`, and `(g, h)`.

2. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)` using the formula:
     \[
     n = (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2
     \]
   - Similarly, it calculates the squared distance between points `(c, d)` and `(g, h)` using the formula:
     \[
     x = (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2
     \]

3. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program compares `n` and `x`.
   - It prints the smaller of the two distances, assuming that the smaller distance corresponds to the side length of the square.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Assumption:**
   - The program assumes that the smaller of the two calculated distances (`n` and `x`) will always be the side length squared of the square. This is not necessarily true.
   - Given the constraints, the side length of the square can be determined by finding the maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates among the four points.

2. **Lack of Verification:**
   - The program does not verify if the four points form a valid square. It simply compares the distances without ensuring that they form right angles and equal side lengths.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly determine the area of the square, we need to:
1. Identify the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
2. Calculate the differences between these coordinates to find the side length of the square.
3. Compute the area as the side length squared.

### Revised Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract all x and y coordinates
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in points]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in points]
        
        # Find the max and min x and y coordinates
        max_x = max(x_coords)
        min_x = min(x_coords)
        max_y = max(y_coords)
        min_y = min(y_coords)
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y)
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(area)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the side length of the square. Therefore, the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
