Output State: **`sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j + 1` in list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j + 1` and `i`, `r` is equal to `[i, j]`, `l` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `r, l = [i, j]` updates the variables `r` and `l` to be the list `[i, j]`. The value of `sm` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on `sm` itself within this line of code. Therefore, the sum `sm` still holds the same value as it did in the initial state, which is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j + 1` in list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j + 1` and `i`. The variable `l` remains unchanged from its initial state.
