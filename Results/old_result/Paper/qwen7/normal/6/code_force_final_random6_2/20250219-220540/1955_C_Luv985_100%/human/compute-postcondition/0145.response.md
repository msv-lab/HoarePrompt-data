Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is `k - (min(a[l], a[r]) * 2)`, `l` must be less than `r`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is `k % 2` if the condition is false, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
