### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis
The goal is to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

#### Given Code Analysis
The code provided has two functions:

1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).

2. **func_2()**: This function processes the input and outputs the required distribution of coins.

#### func_2() Breakdown
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `N = int(input().strip())`: Reads the number of outcomes.
   - `vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]`: Reads the multipliers for each outcome and stores them in a list `vals`.

2. **Calculating Denominator**:
   - `den = vals[0]`: Initializes the denominator with the first multiplier.
   - `for x in vals: den = func_1(den, x)`: Iterates through the multipliers and updates the denominator to the LCM of all multipliers.

3. **Calculating Values**:
   - `vprod = [den // r for r in vals]`: Calculates the value to bet on each outcome as `den // r` where `r` is the multiplier.
   - `den = den - sum(vprod)`: Adjusts the denominator by subtracting the sum of the calculated values.

4. **Output**:
   - If `den <= 0`, prints `-1` indicating no valid solution.
   - Otherwise, prints the values to bet on each outcome.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Denominator Calculation**:
   - The denominator `den` is set to the LCM of all multipliers. This ensures that the distribution is fair and balanced across all outcomes.

2. **Value Calculation**:
   - The value to bet on each outcome is calculated as `den // r`. This ensures that the total bet is evenly distributed and leverages the LCM property.

3. **Adjustment**:
   - Subtracting the sum of the calculated values from `den` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the total bet is not strictly less than the amount received back by checking if `den <= 0` and printing `-1` if true.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program. The calculation of `den` as the LCM of all multipliers does not guarantee that the total bet will be strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. Instead, it ensures that the total bet is evenly distributed, which is not sufficient to meet the problem's requirement.

Consider the following example:
- Inputs: `N = 3`, `vals = [3, 2, 7]`
- LCM of `[3, 2, 7]` is `42` (since `42` is the smallest number divisible by `3`, `2`, and `7`).
- Calculated values: `42 // 3 = 14`, `42 // 2 = 21`, `42 // 7 = 6`.
- Total bet: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`.
- Amount received back: `3 * 14 = 42`, `2 * 21 = 42`, `7 * 6 = 42`.

Here, the total bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. The logic of calculating the LCM and distributing the bet evenly does not satisfy the problem's constraints.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
