Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle the scenario where buying in pairs using the promotion price is more cost-effective than buying individually, especially when the number of yogurts is odd and the promotion price for two yogurts is significantly lower than twice the individual price.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3 5 11
```
According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price (11 burles) and 1 yogurt at the individual price (5 burles), resulting in a total cost of 16 burles. However, the program prints 15, which is incorrect because it only considers the division of yogurts into pairs without checking the overall minimum cost.

To fix this, the program should ensure that it checks both the cost of buying all yogurts individually and the cost of using the promotion price for as many pairs as possible, then adjust for any remaining yogurts.
