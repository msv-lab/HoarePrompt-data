Output State: **`ans` is either 1 or 2; `sm` is now `sm - 2`; `m` is less than or equal to `n`; `r` is `m + 2`; `ca[a[2]]` is decremented by 1; `ca[a[m + 2]]` has been incremented by 1; `ca[a[r]]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `sm -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `sm`. Since `sm` was initially either `sm - 1` or `sm - 2`, after executing the code, `sm` will be `sm - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
