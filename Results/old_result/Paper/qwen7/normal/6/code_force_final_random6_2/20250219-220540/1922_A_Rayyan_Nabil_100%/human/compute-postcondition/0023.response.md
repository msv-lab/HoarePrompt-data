State: **`results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration, `result` is the first element in the `results` list, `t` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `result` is taken from the `results` list, so the initial state of `result` should be set to the first element in the `results` list.
- The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list, which means `t` (the number of iterations) must be greater than 0. Since `t` represents the total number of iterations, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
