Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the array elements, `i` is 5, `order` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `order` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its initial state (which was not explicitly given but implied to be 0 since it's not mentioned otherwise) to 1. The variable `i` is also incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The list `a` and the condition for `num2` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
