Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input; `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input. The value of `n` is not equal to `k`. If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition holds with `n + 2` less than or equal to `k * 2`.
