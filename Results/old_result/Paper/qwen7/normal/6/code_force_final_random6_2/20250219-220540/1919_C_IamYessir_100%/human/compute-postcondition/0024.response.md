Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being `x`, `i` is 0, `y` is the last element of list `b`, and now `b` has an additional element which is equal to `lit[0]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 0, `lit[i]` is `lit[0]`. Therefore, `b` gains an additional element which is `lit[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
