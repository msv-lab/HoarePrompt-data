Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` must be at least 4, `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `s` is 12, `i` is 101.

Explanation: The loop runs `x` times, and each iteration updates `s` according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. Starting with `s = 1`, after the first iteration, `s` becomes 2. After the second iteration, `s` becomes 4. After the third iteration, `s` becomes 6. This pattern continues, and after `x` iterations, `s` will be \(2^x\). Given that `x` is at least 4, `s` will be \(2^4 = 16 - 4 = 12\) (since the loop starts from `i=3` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the actual number of iterations is `x-2`). Therefore, after all iterations, `s` will be 12, and `i` will be `3 + (x - 1) = 101` if `x` is 98 (the maximum value for `x` under given constraints).
