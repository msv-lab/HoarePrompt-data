Output State: **`cur_arr` contains at least one element; `xor` is 0; `new_arr` contains the value of `xor`.**

Explanation: Initially, `xor` was the XOR of `xor` and the first element of `cur_arr`. After setting `xor = 0`, `xor` is now explicitly 0. The other variables (`cur_arr` and `new_arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
