Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and the input value used to determine the range of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000
   - `y` is `x - 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations. Since `i` starts at 0, the first iteration will occur if `int(input())` is 1. For subsequent iterations, `i` will increment by 1 each time.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value of 0, so `i` will be 1.
   - The input value for the next iteration will be taken from the user, but since we are only adjusting the state based on the loop head, we don't need to change `x` or `y`.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`. Therefore, the new state should reflect `i` being 1, and the other variables remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `y` is `x - 1`**
