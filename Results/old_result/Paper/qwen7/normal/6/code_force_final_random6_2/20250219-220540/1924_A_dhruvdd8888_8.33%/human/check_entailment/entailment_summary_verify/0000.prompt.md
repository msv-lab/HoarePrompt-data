You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        return print('YES')
    print('NO')
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets of length `m`. For each test case defined by integers `n` and `k`, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` unique characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO' and appends any missing characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets to the result string `ans`, followed by 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the solution for checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. 

The main issue lies in the logic used to determine if all such strings are subsequences of `s`. Specifically:

1. The program attempts to find a sequence of characters in `s` that matches the first `k` characters of the alphabet (`us`). It does this by iterating through `s` and adding characters to `win` if they are in `us`, and clearing `win` once `k` characters have been found.

2. After finding such a sequence, the program checks if the length of `ans` (which stores the sequence of characters found) is greater than or equal to `n`. However, this approach does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as a subsequence of `s`.

3. The program incorrectly assumes that if a sequence of length `k` is found, then all strings of length `n` can be formed as a subsequence. This is not true because the sequence found might not cover all possible combinations of characters.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 3 10
  aabbccabab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
aa
```

This is incorrect because all possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c') do occur as subsequences in the string "aabbccabab" (e.g., "abc", "acb", "bac", etc.).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
