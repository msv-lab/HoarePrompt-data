You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, k is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, and a is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9, where the length of a is equal to n.
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r:
        if k == 0:

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2] - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]\) or \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `n - 3` or `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 4` or `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the variable `t` remains a positive integer as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `n` also remains unchanged, being a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\). The variable `k` takes on a specific form based on the operations performed within the loop, which results in a negative value involving multiples of elements from the list `a`. The variable `a` itself remains a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with a length of `n`. The indices `l` and `r` are set to `n - 3` or `n - 1` and `n - 4` or `n - 3`, respectively, indicating the positions in the list `a` that were last processed. Finally, the variable `sunks` indicates the total number of successful operations (or "sunks") performed during the loop, which ranges between 4 and 10 inclusive, depending on the exact sequence of operations and the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns a value for `sunks` which is either 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, and `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9 with a length equal to `n`. The function returns a value for `sunks` which is either 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a value for `sunks` which is either 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
