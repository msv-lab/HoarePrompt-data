Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples that must not be empty, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to the variable `mod_y`. The values of `arr` and `num` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new variable `mod_y` is introduced with the value of `num % y`.
