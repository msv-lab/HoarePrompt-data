Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ticket Purchase Strategy**:
   - The solution assumes a strategy where tickets are purchased in blocks of `m` tickets per day, but it doesn't fully account for the dynamic pricing increase after purchasing tickets.
   - The logic to calculate the minimum cost is flawed because it doesn't consider all possible ways to distribute the ticket purchases across days to minimize the overall cost.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The calculation of cost assumes that tickets can only be purchased in full blocks of `m` tickets per day, which is not always the optimal strategy.
   - The cost calculation doesn't correctly handle the scenario where tickets are purchased partially on a day and how this affects the subsequent days' prices.

3. **Sorting and Block Purchase Assumption**:
   - Sorting the ticket prices and then purchasing in blocks of `m` tickets might not always yield the minimum cost. The optimal strategy could involve purchasing tickets in smaller quantities spread out over different days to avoid the price increases.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**:
   - The solution doesn't handle edge cases properly, such as when the number of tickets to be purchased (`k`) is less than `m`, or when the ticket prices are very high and the number of days is limited.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to use a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly involving dynamic programming or a greedy approach that considers all possible ways to distribute the ticket purchases across days to minimize the total cost. This involves evaluating the cost of purchasing tickets on each day and considering the impact of the price increase after each purchase.

Here's a more accurate approach using dynamic programming:

```python
def min_cost_to_buy_tickets(n, m, k, prices):
    dp = [math.inf] * (k + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        new_dp = [math.inf] * (k + 1)
        for j in range(k + 1):
            if j <= m:
                new_dp[j] = min(new_dp[j], dp[j] + prices[i] * j)
            for x in range(1, min(j, m) + 1):
                new_dp[j] = min(new_dp[j], dp[j - x] + prices[i] * x + x * x * (x - 1) // 2)
        dp = new_dp
    
    return dp[k]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min_cost_to_buy_tickets(n, m, k, prices))

func()
```

This approach uses dynamic programming to explore all possible ways to purchase tickets while minimizing the total cost, considering the price increase after each purchase.
