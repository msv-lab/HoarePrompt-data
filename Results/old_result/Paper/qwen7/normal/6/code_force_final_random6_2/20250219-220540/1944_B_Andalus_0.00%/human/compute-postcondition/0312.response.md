Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `sz` is 9, `k` is 3, and `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements. The first three elements in the list are the `elem`s printed during each iteration of the loop.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `sz` is less than `k`. Given that `sz` starts at 5 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute as long as `sz` is less than 3. However, since `sz` is already 9, it is no longer less than `k`.

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop will execute a total of 4 times (from `sz` = 5 to `sz` = 9), printing 4 elements from the list `sng`. This means that `sng` must have at least 4 elements to allow the loop to complete its iterations.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `sz` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value of 9. Therefore, `sz` will become 10.

Given these points, let's update the states for the next iteration:

- `sz` will be incremented to 10.
- `k` remains unchanged at 3.
- `sng` must still be a non-empty list with at least 4 elements to ensure the loop completes its iterations.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: `sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements.**
