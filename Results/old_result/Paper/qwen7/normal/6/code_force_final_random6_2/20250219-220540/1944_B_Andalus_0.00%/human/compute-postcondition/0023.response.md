Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. The loop increments `i` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `lft[i]` is either equal to `lft[i - 1]` (when `i` is 1 and `ldb` is set to `[lft[0]]`) or not equal to `lft[i - 1]`.
   - If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1`, we need to check these conditions.
   - If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - If `i` is already at `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `i` will remain unchanged.

Given the current state, let's assume the following (since specific values are not provided):

- Let's say `i` is currently 2 (an example value).
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[3]` (assuming this condition holds).

Since `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be 3.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `lft[i]` is either equal to `lft[i - 1]` (when `i` is 1 and `ldb` is set to `[lft[0]]`) or not equal to `lft[i - 1]`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `lft[i]` is either equal to `lft[i - 1]` (when `i` is 1 and `ldb` is set to `[lft[0]]`) or not equal to `lft[i - 1]`**.
