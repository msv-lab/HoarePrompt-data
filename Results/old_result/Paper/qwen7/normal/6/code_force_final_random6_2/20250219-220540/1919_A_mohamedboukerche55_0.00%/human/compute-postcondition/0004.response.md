Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces.
   - `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations. This means that the loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`. After the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` is now `previous_i + 1`.

5. **Determine the new state**: Since the loop is about to start another iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. The value of `int(input())` remains the same as it is determined by the user input once per loop execution. 

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `s` remains the same (an input string).
- `a` remains the same (the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces).
- `b` remains the same (the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces).
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `int(input())` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is an input string, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces, `i` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` remains the same**.
