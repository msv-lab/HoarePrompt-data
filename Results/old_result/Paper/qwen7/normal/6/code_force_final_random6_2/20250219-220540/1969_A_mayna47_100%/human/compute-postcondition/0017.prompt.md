Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `p` is a list of n integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `v` is updated to include the first element as 0 and the rest as integers from the input split and converted to integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if v[v[i]] == i:
        print(2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the condition `v[v[i]] != i` holds

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\). If `v[v[i]]` equals `i`, the condition `v[v[i]] != i` does not hold anymore.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented to 3. If `v[v[i]]` equals `i`, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function continues with the next iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
