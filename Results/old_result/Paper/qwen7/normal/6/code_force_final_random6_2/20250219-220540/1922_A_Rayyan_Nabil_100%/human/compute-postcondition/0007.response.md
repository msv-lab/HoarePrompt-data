Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the list `results`. Since the actual return value of `func_1` is not specified, it is represented as the return value of the function call. The variable `c` remains unchanged as it was stripped of leading and trailing whitespace before the function call. The initial state of `results` being an empty list is updated to include the return value of the function call.
