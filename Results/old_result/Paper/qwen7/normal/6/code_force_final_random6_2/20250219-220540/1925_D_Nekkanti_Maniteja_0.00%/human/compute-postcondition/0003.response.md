Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \times (n - 1)\) modulo `M`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is assigned the value of the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \times (n - 1)\) modulo `M`. The values of `i`, `t`, `M`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The modular multiplicative inverse exists only if \(n \times (n - 1)\) and `M` are coprime, which is assumed to be true given the problem constraints.
