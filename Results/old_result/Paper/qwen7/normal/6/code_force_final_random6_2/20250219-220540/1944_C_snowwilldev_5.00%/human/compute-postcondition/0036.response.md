Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 2
- `i` is 2
- `N` must still be greater than 0 if `cnt[i]` equals 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 1, `i` remains 2, and `N` must still be greater than 0.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of the variable `i`.

Since the precondition explicitly states that `i` is 2, we can directly use this value.

Output: **2**
