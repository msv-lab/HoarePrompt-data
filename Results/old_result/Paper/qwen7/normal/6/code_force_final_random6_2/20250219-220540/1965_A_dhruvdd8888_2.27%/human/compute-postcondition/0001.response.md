Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, and `nums` is a set containing the elements split from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `nums = set(input().split())` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and then converts those elements into a set called `nums`. The initial values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged. The precondition that the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5 remains valid, but since no specific `n` or `a` values are provided, they are not included in the output state.
