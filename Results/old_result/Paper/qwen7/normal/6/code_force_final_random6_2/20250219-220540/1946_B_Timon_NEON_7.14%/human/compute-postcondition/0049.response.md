Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to the value of `new_segment[0]`, and `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative; `segments_variants` is a list containing one additional variant which is `new_segment + [i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The line `max_segment = new_segment` updates the `max_segment` variable to be equal to the `new_segment` variable. The values of `i`, `arr`, `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` remain unchanged from their previous states.
