Postcondition: `v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0 and `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`, and if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
