Postcondition: `total_max_segment` is now equal to the next `segment` in `segments_variants` and the length of the next `segment` is not 1. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1, then `total_max_segment` remains unchanged and is still equal to the next `segment` in `segments_variants`.
