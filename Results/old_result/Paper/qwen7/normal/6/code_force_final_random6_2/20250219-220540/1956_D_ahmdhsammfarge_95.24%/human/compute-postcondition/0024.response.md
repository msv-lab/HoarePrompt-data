Postcondition: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 0, `r` is 3, `over_sum` is 3 + sum(lst[1:3]) + (3 - 0 + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is 3 + sum(lst[1:3]) + (3 - 0 + 1). If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `sm` remains unchanged and the other variables retain their values. If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, then the values of `l` and `r` change to 0 and 3 respectively, while `over_sum`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain as they were.
