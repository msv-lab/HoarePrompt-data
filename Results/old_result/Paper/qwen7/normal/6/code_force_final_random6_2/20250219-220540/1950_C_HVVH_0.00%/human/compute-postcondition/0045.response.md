Postcondition: `h` is an integer converted from the first part of the input split by ':', `m` is an integer converted from the second part of the input split by ':', and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` equals 12, then no change is made to `h`, `m`, and `day` remains 'PM'. If `h` does not equal 12, then no change is made to `h`, `m`, and `day` remains 'PM'.
