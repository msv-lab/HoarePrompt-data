Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`, the new value of `t` will still satisfy this condition. The variable `n` is not mentioned in the initial state or the code snippet, so its value remains unchanged and is not specified in the output state.
