Output State: **`ans` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is [0, 0]**.

The code initializes `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `zeroes`, `t`, `n`, or `cnt`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
