Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Analyze the postconditions**:
   - `hd` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `hd` is either equal to `hd - 1` or remains unchanged.
   - If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - Since `hd` is either equal to `hd - 1` or remains unchanged, we need to consider both possibilities.
   - `res` may or may not be incremented depending on the values of `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `hd` could be `hd - 1` or remain the same.
- `res` could be incremented if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.

Since we don't know the exact value of `hd` or `res` at the end of the previous iteration, we'll keep them as general conditions.

**State:**
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` must be the same as before.
- `hd` is an integer greater than 0 and is either equal to `hd - 1` or remains unchanged.
- `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before, `hd` is an integer greater than 0 and is either equal to `hd - 1` or remains unchanged, `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'**.
