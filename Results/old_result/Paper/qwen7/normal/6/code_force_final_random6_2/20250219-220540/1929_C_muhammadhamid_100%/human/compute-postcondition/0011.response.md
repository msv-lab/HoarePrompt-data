Based on the initial state and the operations described:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\).
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\).
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
- `s` is 8.
- `i` is 3.

The loop updates `s` as follows:
- After 1st iteration: \(s = 1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1 = 2\)
- After 2nd iteration: \(s = 2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1 = 4\)
- After 3rd iteration: \(s = 4 + 4 // (k - 1) + 1 = 6\)
- After 4th iteration: \(s = 6 + 6 // (k - 1) + 1 = 8\)

After the loop, `s` is 8. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

The print statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No".

Given that `s` is 8 and `a` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), the condition `a >= s` will always be true because \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\) and \(s = 8\).

Output: **Yes**
