Postcondition: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is either 2 or 1, `r` is either `n-3` or `n-2`, `ans` is either 3 or 2, `t` is `k % 2`, and if the if condition is met, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`. If the if condition is not met, `r` and `ans` remain unchanged, and `t` is set to `k % 2`.**
