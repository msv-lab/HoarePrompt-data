You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will be a list `s` of integers entered by the user, `n` is equal to the length of the list `s`, and `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence where an element in `s` is 0 and there was a previous non-zero element (i.e., `n` was greater than 0).
    #
    #In more detail, if during the loop's execution, there were `k` instances where an element in `s` was 0 and `n` was not 0 before that, then `ans` will be `n + k`. If no such instances occurred, `ans` will remain 0. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `s` after the loop completes.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each occurrence where an element in s is 0 and there was a previous non-zero element)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, the input is a binary string s where 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5 and s consists only of '0' and '1'.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the condition for executing the loop does not change with each iteration (it always checks if `t > 0`), and we know it executes at least 3 times with this condition being true, it implies that `t` was initially greater than 0 and remained so throughout all iterations. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must still be greater than 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring that was shifted.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1()` is supposed to handle a single test case.
   - `func_2()` is supposed to handle multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

3. **`func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function reads a list of integers from input but does not actually use this list. Instead, it should read a single binary string.
   - It initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string (which is incorrectly treated as a list of integers).
   - If it encounters a '1', it increments `n`.
   - If it encounters a '0' after encountering at least one '1', it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

4. **Issues with `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads a list of integers instead of a binary string. This will cause issues because the input should be a single string.
   - The logic to calculate the minimum cost is incorrect. The current logic does not account for the actual positions of '0's and '1's and how they need to be rearranged via cyclic shifts.

5. **Expected Correct Logic**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest prefix of '1's and then count the number of '0's that come after this prefix. The cost would be the sum of the lengths of these segments plus the length of the remaining part of the string.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: **False**
