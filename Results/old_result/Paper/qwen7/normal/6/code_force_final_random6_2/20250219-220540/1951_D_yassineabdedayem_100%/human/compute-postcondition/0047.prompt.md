Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
    elif n + 2 > k * 2:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
        print(1)
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input; `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the first and second space-separated values in input respectively. If `n` equals `k`, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `n` and `k` are updated to their respective integer values from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged regardless of whether `n` equals `k` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
