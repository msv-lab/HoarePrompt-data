Output State: **`a` must have a length of at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3.**

Explanation: The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` creates a substring `s` from the string `a` starting at index `i` and taking 3 characters. The variables `a`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
