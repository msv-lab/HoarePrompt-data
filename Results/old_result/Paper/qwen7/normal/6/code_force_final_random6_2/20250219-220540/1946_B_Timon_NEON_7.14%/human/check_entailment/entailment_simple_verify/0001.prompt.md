You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is used to ensure the result fits within the required modulo constraint.
   - This function is correct and necessary.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - However, the implementation seems flawed:
     - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` incorrectly.
     - It doesn't properly handle the logic for finding the maximum subarray sum.
     - It appends the entire array to `segments_variants` without checking if it's the maximum.
     - It doesn't return the maximum sum but instead returns a list which is not used correctly.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not seem to be used in the main logic.
   - It is not relevant to solving the problem and can be ignored.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem, we need to maximize the sum of the array after performing k operations. Here’s how we can do it:

1. **Calculate the initial sum of the array**.
2. **Determine the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm**.
3. **Use the maximum subarray sum to calculate the potential increase in the array sum**.
4. **Apply the modulo operation**.

### Correct Implementation

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import *

MOD = 1000000007

def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_sum = current_sum = arr[0]
    for num in arr[1:]:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

def max_array_sum_after_k_operations(n, k, arr):
    initial_sum = sum(arr)
    max_subarray = max_subarray_sum(arr)
    
    # If k is greater than or equal to the length of the array, we can make the array full of the max subarray sum
    if k >= n:
        return (initial_sum + (k - n) * max_subarray) % MOD
    
    # Otherwise, we just add the max subarray sum k times
    return (initial_sum + k * max_subarray) % MOD

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_array_sum_after_k_operations(n, k, arr))
```

### Conclusion

The provided program has issues with the `func_2` function and lacks the complete logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
