Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input operation. The other conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state (such as `n` and the numbers on the whiteboard) are not affected by this line of code.
