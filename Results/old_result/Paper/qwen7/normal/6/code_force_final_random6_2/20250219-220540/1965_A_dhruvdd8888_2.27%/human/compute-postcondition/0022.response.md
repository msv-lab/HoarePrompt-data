Postcondition: `cd` is 1 if the difference between `nums[i+1]` and `nums[i]` is equal to 1, and `cd` is 0 if the difference between `nums[i+1]` and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3.
