Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, it is given that `i` is 3 and `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Determine the New State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
