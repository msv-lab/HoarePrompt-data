### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the input and initializes the list `lst`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to find the optimal indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of the array after performing the operation.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of the array after performing the operation.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is to iterate through all possible subarrays and calculate the sum of the elements before `i` and after `j` plus the square of the distance between `i` and `j`.
   - However, the logic seems flawed because it calculates `sm` as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j+1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`, which does not directly relate to the MEX operation. Instead, it should focus on finding the MEX of the subarray and setting all elements in the subarray to the MEX.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is supposed to recursively update the operations list `ops`.
   - However, the function is incomplete and does not return any value. It also does not seem to be used in the main logic of the program.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function is supposed to set all elements in the subarray from `r` to `l` to the MEX of the subarray.
   - The function logic is incorrect. It appends the same operation twice and does not handle the MEX calculation properly.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - After calling `func_1`, the program enters a loop to set all zeros in the array to 1.
   - This part of the logic is correct in theory but does not account for the MEX operation, which is crucial for maximizing the sum.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of the array and the number of operations performed.
   - The operations list `ops` is printed in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the MEX operation and does not maximize the sum of the array as required by the problem statement. The logic in `func_1` and `func_3` is incorrect, and the overall approach does not follow the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
**False**
