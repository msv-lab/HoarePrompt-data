Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
2. The provided solution simply sets \( y = x - 1 \) and prints it.
3. Let's analyze whether this approach always yields the correct result:
   - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \(\gcd(x, y) = \gcd(x, x-1) = 1\) because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers and thus coprime.
   - Therefore, \(\gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x\).
4. However, we need to check if there could be a better choice for \( y \):
   - For any \( y < x - 1 \), \(\gcd(x, y)\) could be greater than 1, but \( y \) itself would be smaller, potentially leading to a sum less than \( x \).
   - For example, if \( x = 10 \), setting \( y = 9 \) gives \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\), but setting \( y = 8 \) gives \(\gcd(10, 8) + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10\), which is not larger than 10.
5. The solution does not guarantee that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized; it only guarantees that \(\gcd(x, y) + y = x\), which is not necessarily the maximum possible value.

Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
