The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5), k (an integer between 1 and 10^9), PB and PS (integers between 1 and n), p (a list of n integers representing a permutation), and a (a list of n integers where each element is in the range 1 to 10^9). It calculates scores for two individuals based on their positions PB and PS using the `calculate_score` function. Depending on which score is higher, the function returns either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'.
