Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and maps each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `s`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
