Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `tree` is a Tree object initialized with `n` vertices.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
    tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `[u, v]` is a list of two integers obtained from input, and the edge (u-1, v-1) has been added to the tree.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `[u, v]` is a list of two integers where u-1 and v-1 are connected by an edge in the tree

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `[u, v]` is a list of two integers, `tree` now has an edge between node `u - 1` and node `v - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
