Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

2. **Analyze each variable in the loop condition**:
   - `l`: The current left index.
   - `r`: The current right index.
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: This checks if the current element is equal to the next element in the array.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions in the loop head must be true.
   - `l < r`: This condition ensures that the indices are within bounds and there is at least one pair of elements to compare.
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: This condition ensures that the current element is equal to the next element.

4. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `st` and `end` are not relevant to the loop condition.
   - `ans` is either `n - 3` or `0` based on the first and last elements of `a`.

5. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, `l < r` is initially true as long as `n > 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` is true for the loop to execute the first time.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `a[0] == a[1]` is true.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`**
