Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or 2; `sm` is now `sm - 2`; `m` is less than or equal to `n`; `r` is `m + 2`; `ca[a[2]]` is decremented by 1; `ca[a[m + 2]]` has been incremented by 1; `ca[a[r]]` is increased by 1. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, then no change occurs to `sm`.
