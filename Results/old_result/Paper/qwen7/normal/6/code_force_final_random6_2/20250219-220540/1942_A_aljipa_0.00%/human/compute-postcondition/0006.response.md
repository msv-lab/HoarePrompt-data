Output State: **`res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n`, otherwise `res` is `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (inclusive) minus 1, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This changes the values of `n` and `k`, but does not affect the value of `res` or `t`. The value of `res` remains as specified based on the conditions involving `k`, and `t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (inclusive) minus 1.
