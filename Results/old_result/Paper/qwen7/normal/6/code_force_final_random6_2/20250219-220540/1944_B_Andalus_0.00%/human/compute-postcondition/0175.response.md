Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`; additionally, the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`; `sng` now contains the value of `lft[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `sng` will now include the first element of `lft` (since `lft[i]` corresponds to the first element when `i` is 1). All other conditions remain unchanged.
