Output State: **`count` is 4 + `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` + `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]`, `arr` is a non-empty list that does not contain its third element, `num` is the third element in the list, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is updated, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is 2, `mod_x` is `-num % x` which is equivalent to `x - (num % x)` if `num % x` is not zero, otherwise it is 0.**

Explanation: The code `mod_x_key = num % x` simply updates the value of `mod_x_key` to be the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
