Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `initial_t - n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `n` is now an input integer, while the other variables retain their initial values or expressions.
