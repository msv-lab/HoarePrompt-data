Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(nums[0] + nums[1])`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `nums[0]` will be the largest integer in the list, and `nums[1]` will be the second largest integer in the list.
2. The expression `nums[0] + nums[1]` will add these two largest integers together.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the two largest integers in the `nums` list.

Output: **the sum of the two largest integers in the `nums` list**
