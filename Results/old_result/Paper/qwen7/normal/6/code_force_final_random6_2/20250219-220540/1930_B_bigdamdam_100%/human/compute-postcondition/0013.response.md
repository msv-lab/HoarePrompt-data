Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, `ind` is `ind - 6`, `p[3]` is `ind - 6`, `p[5]` is `ind - 2`**

Explanation: The variable `ind` is decremented by 2. Initially, `ind` was set to `ind - 4`. After the decrement, `ind` becomes `ind - 6`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
