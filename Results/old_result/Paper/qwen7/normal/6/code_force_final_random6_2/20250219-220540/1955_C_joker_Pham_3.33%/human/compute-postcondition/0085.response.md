Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is `-2 * a[n]`, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` must be equal to `n`, `r` must be `n - 2`, `sunks` is either 4 or 5, `a[r]` is `a[r] - a[l]`.**

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. Since `sunks` was initially either 3 or 4, it will now be either 4 or 5. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
