Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` and `b` are lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`, `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least one element. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i-1]`, then `s` is set to `1`. There is no else part in the code, so no additional changes occur if the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 2, and `s` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[i - 1]`, the values of `a`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from the previous state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, and if `a[3]` is greater than `a[2]`, then `s` is 1. If `a[3]` is not greater than `a[2]`, then `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
