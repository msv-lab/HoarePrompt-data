Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
            suma += x
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                suma += 1
    print(suma - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All iterations of the loop have been executed. The value of `b` is now 0, `a` retains its initial value, `info` remains unchanged, `suma` contains the sum of all valid `x` values plus additional 1s based on the specified conditions within the loop, and `x` is the last computed value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: b is greater than or equal to 4, i is 5, x is 4, and suma is 15.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `b` must be greater than 9, `i` is 7, `x` is calculated based on the current value of `i`, `suma` is increased by the sum of `x` values for each iteration, and the final `suma` is 43.

To explain this output state in more detail:
- The loop continues until `i` exceeds `b`.
- After the first 3 iterations, `i` was 6, so after all iterations, `i` will be 7.
- The value of `b` must be greater than 9 because the loop increments `i` starting from 5, and it needs to run through at least 7 iterations.
- The value of `x` changes with each iteration of `i`. For `i=7`, `x` would be calculated as `(a - 7 * 6) // 49 + 1`.
- The `suma` variable accumulates the value of `x` for each valid iteration where the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` holds true. Based on the given information, the total increase in `suma` after all iterations is 43.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
