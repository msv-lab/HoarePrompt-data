Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `count` is `num % y` + (-num % x) + 2
   - `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements
   - `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 3
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`
   - `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 1
   - `mod_x_key` is `num % x`

3. **Determine the adjustments needed**:
   - `num`: This variable changes with each iteration of the loop. At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the last element processed from `arr`.
   - `arr`: The list `arr` remains the same throughout the loop unless explicitly modified within the loop body. Since no modifications are mentioned, `arr` remains unchanged.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `num` to the next element in `arr`. Since `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, there is at least one more element to process.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `num` will be the next element in `arr`.
   - `count` will be recalculated based on the new `num`.
   - `results` will be updated with the new `count` value if necessary.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`count` is `next_num % y` + (-next_num % x) + 2, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 3, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 1, `mod_x_key` is `next_num`**

Where `next_num` is the next element in `arr`.
