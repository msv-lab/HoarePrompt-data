Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes the score `ans` to 0.
   - It splits the input string into a list of integers `lst`.
   - The loop iterates `n * 2` times, but this is problematic because the list length decreases as elements are removed.

3. **Choosing Minimum Elements:**
   - The program attempts to add the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` to the score `ans`.
   - It then removes these two elements from `lst`.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - If fewer than 2 elements remain, it adds the minimum of the remaining elements to the score and breaks out of the loop.
   - This handling is incorrect because it does not ensure all pairs are considered optimally.

5. **Outputting Results:**
   - The results are stored in `ans_f` and printed at the end.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition `for i in range(n * 2)` is incorrect. It should iterate `n` times, ensuring all pairs are considered.

2. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - The handling of fewer than 2 elements is flawed. It should continue processing until all elements are exhausted.

3. **Optimal Pair Selection:**
   - The program does not ensure optimal pair selection. It simply takes the first two elements, which may not yield the maximum score.

### Correct Approach:
To achieve the optimal score, we need to sort the list and repeatedly take the minimum of the first two elements. This ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, maximizing the score.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to ensure optimal pairing
        ans = 0
        while lst:
            # Take the minimum of the first two elements
            ans += min(lst.pop(0), lst.pop(0))
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed loop condition and handling of remaining elements. The revised program addresses these issues by sorting the list and ensuring optimal pairing.

**Correctness: False**
