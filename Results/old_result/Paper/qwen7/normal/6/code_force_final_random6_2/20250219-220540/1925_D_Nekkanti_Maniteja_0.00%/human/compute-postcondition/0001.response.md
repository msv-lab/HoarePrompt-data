Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `i` remains unchanged with its initial value of 0. The variable `t` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `k` as integers, while `i` and the constraint on `t` remain as specified in the initial state.
