Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size', and `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` was greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to be `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'.**

This means that the remaining size of vertex `v` is increased by the remaining size of vertex `u`. Additionally, the good components count of vertex `v` is increased by the good components count of vertex `u`. If the remaining size of vertex `u` was greater than or equal to `x`, the good components count of vertex `v` is further incremented by 1. Otherwise, the remaining size of vertex `v` is updated to include the remaining size of vertex `u`.
