Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, splits them, and converts each to an integer. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` remain unchanged. The new variables `g` and `h` are assigned the first and second integers from the input split and converted to integers, respectively.
