Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 9999, `n` is the integer value of the last input, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the integer value of an input during the loop iterations, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `values` with a length equal to the maximum value in the `numbers` list plus one, and all elements set to 0. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `numbers`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states, and the new list `values` is added to the state.
