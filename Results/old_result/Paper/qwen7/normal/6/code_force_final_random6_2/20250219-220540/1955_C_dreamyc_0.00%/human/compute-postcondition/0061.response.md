Postcondition: **Output State: The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is greater than 0 and the length of `nums` is at least 2. After all iterations, the following conditions hold: `nums` will be a deque with elements reduced by pairs until either `k` becomes 0 or `nums` no longer has at least 2 elements. `a` will be the first element of `nums` after the final call to `popleft()`, and `b` will be the last element of `nums` after the final call to `pop()`. `ans` will be the total count of times `b` was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution. `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `k` will be 0 if the loop terminates naturally (i.e., `k` becomes 0 due to the while loop condition), or it may be a non-negative value if the loop exits because `len(nums)` is less than 2. `n` and `k` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop. `x` will be the minimum of `a` and `b` at the final iteration, adjusted according to the conditions inside the loop. If the length of `nums` is now 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to the first element of `nums`, then `k` is set to 0 and the loop terminates.**
