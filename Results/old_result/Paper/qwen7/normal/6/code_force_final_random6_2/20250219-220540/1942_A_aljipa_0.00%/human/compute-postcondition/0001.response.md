State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive)**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the upper limit for the range function.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid value that satisfies the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`.
3. The initial state given is that `t` is an input integer, but it does not specify the exact value or range.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` needs to be within the specified range.

Hence, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive).
