Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `d` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` down to `0`. This means `d` starts at `n-1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d` is -1 (which means the loop has already completed its iterations).
   - `n` is the same as before (unchanged).
   - `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`.
   - The most internal loop or if statement was broken if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `path` contained the value `v` appended to it.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - Since `d` is currently -1, the loop has already completed its iterations. Therefore, there is no need to adjust `d` further because the loop is done.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - `v` being no longer in `remaining_vertices` suggests that the condition to break the loop was met, but since the loop has already completed, this state does not change.
   - There is no mention of `path` in the loop head, so we do not need to adjust it here.

5. **Conclusion**: Since the loop has already completed its iterations, there are no adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will not execute again because `d` is already at its final value of -1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`**.
