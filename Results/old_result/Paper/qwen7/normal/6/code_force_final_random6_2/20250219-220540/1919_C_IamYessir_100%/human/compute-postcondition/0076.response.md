Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cp` is 0
   - `t` must be at least 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `lit` is a list of integers
   - `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`
   - `i` is 0
   - `y` is the last element of list `b`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop condition is `i < n`, after the first iteration, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Given these points, we can update the state as follows:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 1, and `y` is the last element of list `b`.**
