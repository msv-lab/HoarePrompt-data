Output State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers, and the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1; `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i]` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers, and the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1, after executing `res.append(a[i])`, `res` will contain the element `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
