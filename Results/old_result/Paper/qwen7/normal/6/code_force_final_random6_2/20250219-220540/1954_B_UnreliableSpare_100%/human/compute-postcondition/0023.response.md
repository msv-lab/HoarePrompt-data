Output State: **`ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')`, `i` is `n-1`, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is `0`, the loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n-1`, the value of `n` must be greater than 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `arr[i]` must not be equal to `arr[i-1]`, the variable `flag` remains `False` throughout the entire loop execution.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `val` and `cnt`. `val` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the array `arr`. `cnt` is initialized to 0. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
