Output State: **`cycle_score` is increased by the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]`, `cycle_pos` is updated to the value of `p[cycle_pos - 1]`, `cycle_length` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cycle_pos` to the value of `p[cycle_pos - 1]`. The other variables (`cycle_score` and `cycle_length`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
