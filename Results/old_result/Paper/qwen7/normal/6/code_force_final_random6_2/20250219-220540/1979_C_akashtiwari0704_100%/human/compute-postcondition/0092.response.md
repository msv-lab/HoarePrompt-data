Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. This means `g` is now the product of its original value and the element `l[i]` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions that `len(l)` must be at least 8 and the initial state of `g` being updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` and `i` being `i + 1` remain valid.
