Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute again if `i < n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must still be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` will be 3 in the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Based on this reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0**
