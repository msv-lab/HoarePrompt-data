Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is decreased by 1, but the value of `t` itself is not relevant to the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but again, the value of `n` is not needed for the print statement.
- `i` must be 1.

The print statement is `print(i)`, and since `i` is explicitly stated to be 1, the output will be the integer 1.

Output: **1**
