Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in s:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. After each iteration, `i` takes the value of the current character from the string `s`, and `s` is effectively reduced by removing the first character.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `s` is a non-empty string without leading or trailing spaces.
   - `a` is a set containing the first character of the original string `s` and the added character `i`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop removes the first character from `s` after each iteration, `s` will now be the string `s` without its first character.
   - `i` will be the first character of the original `s` (since it was added to `a`).
   - `a` will still contain the first character of the original `s` and the current character `i`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `s` will now be the string `s` without its first character.
   - `i` will be the first character of the original `s`.
   - `a` will still contain the first character of the original `s` and the current character `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string without leading or trailing spaces, `i` is the first character of the original string `s`, and `a` is a set containing the first character of the original string `s` and the current character `i`**.
