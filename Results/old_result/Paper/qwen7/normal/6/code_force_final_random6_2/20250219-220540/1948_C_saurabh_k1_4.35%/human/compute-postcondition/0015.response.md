Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input.
- The string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<'.
- `a` remains unchanged.

The `print('Yes')` statement simply outputs the string 'Yes'. Since no other variables or objects are referenced in this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Yes**
