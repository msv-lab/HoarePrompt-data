Reasoning:
The provided solution checks whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and determines the winner based on this condition. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Game Mechanics**: The game involves alternating moves between Alice and Bob, where each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet. The key observation here is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`) remains unchanged after each complete round of moves. This is because:
   - If a player swaps wallets, the total number of coins remains the same.
   - If a player removes a coin, the total number decreases by one, but the parity changes (even becomes odd, odd becomes even).

2. **Initial Condition**: At the start of the game, the total number of coins is `a + b`. The player who starts (Alice) will always be the one to make the first move. Therefore, the parity of the total number of coins at the start of the game dictates who will eventually lose:
   - If `a + b` is even, Bob will win because he will be the last to make a move when the total number of coins reaches zero.
   - If `a + b` is odd, Alice will win because she will be the last to make a move when the total number of coins reaches zero.

3. **Implementation**: The provided code correctly implements this logic:
   ```python
   def func():
       test = int(input())
       for t in range(test):
           a, b = map(int, input().split())
           
           if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
               print('Bob')
           else:
               print('Alice')
   ```

Given this analysis, the provided solution correctly determines the winner based on the initial parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
