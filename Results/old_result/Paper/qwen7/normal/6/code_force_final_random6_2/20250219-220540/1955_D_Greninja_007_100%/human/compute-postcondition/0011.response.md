Postcondition: `ans` is 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `r` is `m`. If the value of `ca[a[r]]` is less than `cb[a[r]]`, then `sm` is incremented by 1. There is no change in the postcondition if the condition `ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]` is not met.
