Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to install supports for \(k\) bridges over consecutive rows in a river grid. Each bridge must have supports at the start and end, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed \(d\). The cost to install a support in cell \((i, j)\) is \(a_{i,j} + 1\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the minimal cost to install supports in a single row such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most \(d\).
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the smallest values within the sliding window of size \(d\).
   - For each position \(i\) from \(d\) to the end of the row, it updates the cost by adding the smallest value found in the min-heap plus one.
   - The function returns the final cost of the last cell, which represents the minimal cost to install supports in the entire row under the given constraints.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes the input for each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), and \(d\), and the depths of each row.
   - It computes the cost for each row using `func_1(row, d)` and stores these costs in a list `costs`.
   - It then calculates the sum of every \(k\) consecutive elements in `costs` and stores these sums in `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - `func_1` correctly calculates the minimal cost for a single row.
   - `func_2` correctly applies `func_1` to each row and then finds the minimal cost for placing \(k\) bridges over consecutive rows.
   - The logic and calculations align with the problem statement and constraints.

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
