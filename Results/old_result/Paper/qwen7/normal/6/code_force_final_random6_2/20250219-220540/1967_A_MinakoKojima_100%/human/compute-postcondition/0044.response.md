Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `res` is -1, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The code `ans += k // (i + 1)` updates the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `k` by `i + 1` to the current value of `ans`. Given that `i` is 1, `k` is 0, and `i + 1` is 2, `k // (i + 1)` evaluates to `0 // 2`, which is 0. Therefore, `ans` remains 0. All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, `ans`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
