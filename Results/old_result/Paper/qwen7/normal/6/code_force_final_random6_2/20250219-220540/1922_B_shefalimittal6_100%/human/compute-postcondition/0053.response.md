Output State: `cnt` is the sum of all values in the list `v`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is the sum of all updates made to it during the loop iterations, and `n` must be non-negative.

To explain this in natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `cnt` will hold the total count of all elements across the list `v`. The variable `idx` remains unchanged at `4 + n`, as it is only initialized and not modified within the loop. The variable `ans` accumulates the result of the calculations performed inside the loop, specifically the combinations of elements in `v` that meet the conditions specified in the loop body. This means `ans` will be the sum of all `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` and `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is at least 2 or 3, respectively. The variable `n` must be non-negative as per the initial precondition.
