Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 1
- `i` is 1
- `N` must be greater than 0
- If `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` changes to 1 (which it already is), and `i` changes to 1 (which it already is). Otherwise, `t` remains 0, `i` remains 1, and `N` must still be greater than 0.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of the variable `i`.

Output: **1**
