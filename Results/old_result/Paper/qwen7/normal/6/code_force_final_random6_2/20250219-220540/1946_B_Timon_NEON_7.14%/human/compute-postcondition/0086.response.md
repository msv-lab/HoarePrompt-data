Output State: **`segments_variants` contains all the segments generated during the loop's execution, and `total_max_segment` is now [-1]**.

The code assigns the list `[-1]` to the variable `total_max_segment`. This changes the value of `total_max_segment` but does not affect the contents of `segments_variants`.
