You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

For each iteration, `result` appends an element calculated as `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`. Therefore, `result` is a list containing `len(queries)` elements, where each element corresponds to the value of `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` for each `k` in `queries`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `result` will contain `len(queries)` elements, each being the element from `array` at the index specified by `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.

    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` will be 0 (since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0). The final values of `n` and `q` will be those provided by the last set of inputs. The `queries` list will contain the integers provided as part of the last set of inputs, and `operations` will contain the list of operations read from the last iteration. The `result` will be the output of the function `func_1` applied to the final `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: An empty list `array` and an empty list `result` are initialized.
2. **Processing Operations**:
   - For each operation in `operations`, if the operation type (`op_type`) is 1, the value is appended to `array`.
   - If the operation type is 2, the entire `array` is extended by repeating itself `value` times.
3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query `k` in `queries`, the `k`-th element of `array` (considering 1-based indexing) is computed using `(k - 1) % len(array)` and appended to `result`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q` are read.
   - The operations are read and stored in a list of lists `operations`.
   - The queries are read and stored in a list `queries`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments.
   - The result from `func_1` is printed.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Operation Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles appending elements and extending the array as specified.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the modulo operation used in handling queries. Specifically, the modulo operation might not correctly handle large values of `k` when the length of `array` is very small compared to `k`.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)` is used to wrap around the index in the array. This is generally correct for finding the `k`-th element in a circular array, but it assumes that the length of the array is always non-zero and correctly reflects the current state of the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that there will be at least one operation of the first type before any operation of the second type, so the array will never be empty when handling queries.
   - The modulo operation should work correctly within the constraints provided.

### Conclusion

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program appears to be correct. The modulo operation ensures that even if `k` is larger than the current length of the array, it wraps around correctly.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
