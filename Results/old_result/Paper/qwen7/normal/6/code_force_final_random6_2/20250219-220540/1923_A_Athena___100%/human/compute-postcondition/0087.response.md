Output State: The list `a` has been modified such that it no longer contains any leading zeros. All leading zeros have been removed from the list.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will start with the first non-zero element from the original list, followed by all subsequent elements (if any) in their original order.
