Output State: **`i` is `2d + 3`, `min_heap` contains values including `(e[0] + row[i-1] + 1, i)`, `row[i-1]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`, and the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` remains `d + 1` in the next iteration.**

Explanation: The `pass` statement does nothing and does not affect any variables or the state of the program. Therefore, all the variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
