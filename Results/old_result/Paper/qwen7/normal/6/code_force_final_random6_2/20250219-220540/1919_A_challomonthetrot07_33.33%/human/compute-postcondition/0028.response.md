Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `a` is not equal to 1.
- `b` is not equal to 1.
- `a` is even.
- Either `a % 2 != 0` or `b % 2 != 1`.
- `a` is greater than `b`.

The print statement is simply `print('Bob')`.

Since the statement does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, or any other variable, it will always print the string 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
