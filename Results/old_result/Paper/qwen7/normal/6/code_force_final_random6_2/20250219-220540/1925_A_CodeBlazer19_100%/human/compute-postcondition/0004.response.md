Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop condition).
   - `k` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop condition).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - The value of `t` remains the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676.
   - `i` must now be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 1**.
