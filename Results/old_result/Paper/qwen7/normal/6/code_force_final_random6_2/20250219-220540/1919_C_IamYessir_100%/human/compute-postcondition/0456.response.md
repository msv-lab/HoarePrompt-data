Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where the last element is either `float('inf')` or the value appended from `lit[i]`, `b` is a list with three elements where the last element is `lit[2]` if `x == y` is true, otherwise the last element is `b[1]` if `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x` is true, and `y` is `b[1]` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.
