Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is 1, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, `c` is increased by 1.**

In this case, the code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be 0 before this operation. After the operation, `c` becomes 1. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
