Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `s` is 2, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to it. Given the initial state where `s` is 1, the calculation becomes `1 // (k - 1) + 1`. Since `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `(k - 1)` is between 1 and 29. In all cases, `1 // (k - 1)` equals 1 because the division of 1 by any number from 1 to 29 results in 0 (integer division), and adding 1 gives 1. Thus, `s` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
