You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; nums is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:

    #State: Output State: The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is greater than 0 and the length of `nums` is at least 2. After all iterations, the following conditions hold:
    #
    #- `nums` will be a deque with elements reduced by pairs until either `k` becomes 0 or `nums` no longer has at least 2 elements.
    #- `a` will be the first element of `nums` after the final call to `popleft()`, and `b` will be the last element of `nums` after the final call to `pop()`.
    #- `ans` will be the total count of times `b` was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution.
    #- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
    #- `k` will be 0 if the loop terminates naturally (i.e., `k` becomes 0 due to the while loop condition), or it may be a non-negative value if the loop exits because `len(nums)` is less than 2.
    #- `n` and `k` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.
    #- `x` will be the minimum of `a` and `b` at the final iteration, adjusted according to the conditions inside the loop.
    #- If `b` is greater than 0 after the loop, it will be appended to `nums`; otherwise, `ans` will have been incremented each time `b` became non-positive, indicating how many times `b` was reduced to 0 or less during the loop's execution.
    #
    #In summary, the final state of `nums` will reflect the reduction process applied to its elements based on the value of `k`, and `ans` will indicate the cumulative count of times the second-to-last element (`b`) was reduced to 0 or less.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the value of `ans` which is the total count of times `b` was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution, incremented by 1.
    #State: `nums` will be a deque with elements reduced by pairs until either `k` becomes 0 or `nums` no longer has at least 2 elements. `a` will be the first element of `nums` after the final call to `popleft()`, and `b` will be the last element of `nums` after the final call to `pop()`. `ans` will be the total count of times `b` was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution. `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `k` will be 0 if the loop terminates naturally (i.e., `k` becomes 0 due to the while loop condition), or it may be a non-negative value if the loop exits because `len(nums)` is less than 2. `n` and `k` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop. `x` will be the minimum of `a` and `b` at the final iteration, adjusted according to the conditions inside the loop. If `b` is greater than 0 after the loop, it will be appended to `nums`; otherwise, `ans` will have been incremented each time `b` became non-positive, indicating how many times `b` was reduced to 0 or less during the loop's execution. The condition `(k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0]))` is false.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total count of times 'b' was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^9. The function returns the total count of times `b` was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution, either incremented by 1 or not, depending on the case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of `ans` which is the total count of times `b` was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution, incremented by 1.

Case_2: The program returns the total count of times 'b' was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
