Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if n == 1 or ans == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution, `cnt` is 0, and either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` is 0, `n` is 0 or 1, `t` is `initial_t - n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`, and `i` is `n-1`. The condition either `n` equals 1 or `ans` equals `n` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop completes, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` retains its value from the last comparison, `cnt` is 0 if the last element in `a` did not match `tmp`, or it is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, `ans` is the minimum value between its initial value (`n`) and the highest count of consecutive elements that matched `tmp` found during the loop's execution. This condition holds true regardless of whether the `n == 1 or ans == n` condition is met or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
