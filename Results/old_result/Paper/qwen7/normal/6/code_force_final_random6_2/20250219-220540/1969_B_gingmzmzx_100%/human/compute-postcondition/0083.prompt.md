Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is an empty list, `ans` is the total number of times 0 appears in the original list `s` minus the number of times 1 appears in the original list `s`, `zeroes` is the total number of times 0 appears in the original list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where the keys are elements from the original list `s` and the values are their respective counts in the original list `s`, and `c` is the last element processed in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements in `s` have been processed, `ans` is incremented by the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each non-zero element and 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 and the element is 0, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `c` in `s`, and `c` is the last element in `s` after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in `s` have been iterated over; `c` is the last element in `s`; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the sum of increments based on the conditions specified in the loop body for each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
