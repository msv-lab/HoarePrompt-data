Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it determines whether "Alice" or "Bob" should win based on specific conditions related to \(a\) and \(b\). After processing all test cases, it prints the winner for each case.**
