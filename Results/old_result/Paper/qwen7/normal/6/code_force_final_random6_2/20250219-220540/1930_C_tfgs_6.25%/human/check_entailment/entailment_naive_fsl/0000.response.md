Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where multiple elements in the array `a` are equal. According to the problem description, the set `S` should only contain unique elements. However, the program uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `a` before converting it to a set, which can lead to duplicate elements being inserted into `S`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
6 4 8 6 4 8
```

The program will produce the following output:
```
11 7 6 5 4 3
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
11 7 6 5 4 3
```

But since the program does not ensure that `S` contains unique elements, it might produce:
```
11 7 6 5 4 4
```

This is incorrect because `4` is repeated in the set `S`, and the final array `b` should not contain duplicates. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
