Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `4 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `5 * y + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - 4 * y`, `space_y` is equal to `4 * y`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `space_y` to `y * 4`, which is already represented as `4 * y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
