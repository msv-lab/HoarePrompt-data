Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[0]`, `b` is equal to `l[0]`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether `l[0]` is less than or equal to positive infinity, and `x` is 2. If `a > b`, then the condition is always true since `a` and `b` are equal, so no change occurs.
