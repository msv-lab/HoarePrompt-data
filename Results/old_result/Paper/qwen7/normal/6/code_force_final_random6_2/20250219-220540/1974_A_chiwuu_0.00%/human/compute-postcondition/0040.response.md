Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`**.

This means that the value of `t1` has been updated to `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`. All other variables retain their original conditions and values from the initial state.
