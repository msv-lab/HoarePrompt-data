Output State: **`nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `ans` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is at least 0, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is appended to `nums` if `ans` is 1 or `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since the initial value of `ans` was either 1 or 2, after incrementing, `ans` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
