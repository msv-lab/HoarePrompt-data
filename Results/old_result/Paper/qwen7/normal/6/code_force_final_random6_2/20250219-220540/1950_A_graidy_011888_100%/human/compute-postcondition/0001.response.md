State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The initial value of `i` is set to 0 within the loop head.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
4. The value of `t` (which is between 1 and 1000) does not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being set to 0 and `n` being greater than 0.
