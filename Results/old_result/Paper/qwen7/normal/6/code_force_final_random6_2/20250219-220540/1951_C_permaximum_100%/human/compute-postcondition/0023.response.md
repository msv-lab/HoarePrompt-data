Output State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is the sum of its previous value and `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, and `price` is increased by `price_increase`.**

Explanation: The code updates `total_cost` by adding `price * tickets_to_buy` to it. The other variables (`tickets_bought`, `tickets_to_buy`, `price_increase`, and `price`) remain unchanged from their previous states as per the initial conditions.
