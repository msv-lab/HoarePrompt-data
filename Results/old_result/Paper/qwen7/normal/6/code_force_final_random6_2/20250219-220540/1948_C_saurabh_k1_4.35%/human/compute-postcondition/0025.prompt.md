Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(str, input()))
    b = list(map(str, input()))
    if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input. If the string at index `n-2` in `b` is '<', no changes are made. Otherwise, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<', `a` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the new input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<', `a` remains unchanged, `a` is now a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is updated to be a list of strings from the new input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
