Output State: **`ans_list` contains `2*a[0] - 2*n + 1`, `dif` is `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, `res` is `-n + k % n`, `i` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `new_num_iterations`, `a` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `ans_list`, `dif`, `res`, `i`, `num_iterations`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information that `a` is now a sorted list.
