Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer `ans` based on the count of zeros and ones in the binary string `s`. The final output for each test case is the value of `ans`, which represents the number of valid subarrays under specific conditions.**
