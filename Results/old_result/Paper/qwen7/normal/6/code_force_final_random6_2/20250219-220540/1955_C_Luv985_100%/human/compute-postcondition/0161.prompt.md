Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `T` is False, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` at each iteration.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (`k - mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k % 2 + k // 2`), `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[r]` is `0` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is `l + 1` if `a[l]` equals 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, and `t` is `k % 2` if `mi * 2 > k`.

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is adjusted based on the if condition (either `k - 2 * mi` if the condition `mi * 2 <= k` is true, or remains unchanged if false), `l` is either `l + 1` less than `r` if `a[l]` equals 0, or remains unchanged otherwise, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `t` is `k % 2` if the condition is false, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement in both cases.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (`k - (min(a[l], a[r]) * 2)` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise unchanged), `l` is incremented by 1, `mi` is updated to the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` or `a[r - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2`, and `a[r]` or `a[r - 1]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` equals 0, then `r` is decremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
