Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case, and calculates the number of beautiful pairs using a mapping approach to efficiently count the pairs that satisfy the conditions \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). The implementation appears to handle the constraints and examples provided accurately.
