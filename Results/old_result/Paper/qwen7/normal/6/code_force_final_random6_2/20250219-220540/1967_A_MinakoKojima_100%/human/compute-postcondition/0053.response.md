Postcondition: `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `k` is either `-2 * dif` or 0, `ans` is either `dif` or 0, `res` is either -2 or -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. This is because if `k == 0`, the conditions and values of `i`, `dif`, `k`, `ans`, and `res` remain unchanged as specified in the if part, and there is no else part to alter these conditions.
