Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is either `r - l - 1` if `a[0] == a[-1]` and `st` is greater than 0, or 0 otherwise, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code updates `st` and `end` to 0. The values of `l`, `r`, `ans`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
