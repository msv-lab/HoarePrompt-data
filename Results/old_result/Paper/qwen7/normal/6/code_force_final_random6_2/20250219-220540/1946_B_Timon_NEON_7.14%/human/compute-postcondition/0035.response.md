Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is updated to the maximum possible value starting from the first element of `arr`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `segments_variants` is a list containing one additional element which is either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` depending on the condition of the if statement.**

Explanation: The line `new_segment = []` initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `arr`, `max_segment`, or `segments_variants`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
