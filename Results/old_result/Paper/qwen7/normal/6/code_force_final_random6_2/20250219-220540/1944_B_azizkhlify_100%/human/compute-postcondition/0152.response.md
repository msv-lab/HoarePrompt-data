Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. However, the values of `a` and `r` are not provided, so we cannot specify the exact value of `r[a[i] - 1]`. We know that `i` is `n + 2`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
