Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.
- The condition `a < b < c` is false.
- The condition `a < b and b > c` is true.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('PEAK')` will simply output the string 'PEAK'.

Output: **PEAK**
