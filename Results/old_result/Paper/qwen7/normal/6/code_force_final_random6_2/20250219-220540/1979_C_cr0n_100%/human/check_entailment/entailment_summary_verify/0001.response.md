### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and the logic implemented in the code. However, let's break down the code and the problem again to ensure every detail is covered and to validate the correctness.

1. **Problem Restatement**:
   - We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - The total bet should be minimized while ensuring the condition is met.

2. **Code Breakdown**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).
   - **func_2()**: 
     - Reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N \).
     - Initializes `den` with the first multiplier.
     - Updates `den` to the LCM of all multipliers.
     - Calculates the value to bet on each outcome as `den // k_i`.
     - Adjusts `den` by subtracting the sum of these values.
     - Prints `-1` if `den` is non-positive, otherwise prints the values to bet on each outcome.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Denominator Calculation**: 
     - `den = vals[0]` initializes `den` with the first multiplier.
     - `for x in vals: den = func_1(den, x)` iteratively updates `den` to the LCM of all multipliers. This ensures `den` is the smallest number that is a multiple of all multipliers.
   - **Value Calculation**:
     - `vprod = [den // r for r in vals]` calculates the value to bet on each outcome as `den // k_i`.
     - `den = den - sum(vprod)` adjusts `den` by subtracting the sum of these values. This ensures the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.
   - **Output**:
     - If `den <= 0`, prints `-1` indicating no valid solution.
     - Otherwise, prints the values to bet on each outcome.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where the total bet is not strictly less than the amount received back by checking if `den <= 0` and printing `-1` if true.

### Validation
- The logic of using the LCM to ensure the total bet is minimized and evenly distributed is sound.
- The adjustment step ensures the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.
- The edge case handling is appropriate.

### Conclusion
The original assessment accurately describes the logic and correctly identifies the correctness of the code.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
