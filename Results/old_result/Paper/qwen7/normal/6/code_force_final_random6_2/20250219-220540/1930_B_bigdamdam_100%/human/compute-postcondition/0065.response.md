Output State: **`ind` is `n-2`, `i` is 8, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `p[8]` is `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decremented by 2, making it `n-2`. The values of `i`, `n`, `p` (which is a list of length `n` filled with zeros), and `p[8]` being `n` remain unchanged.
