Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `hd` is `hd - 1`, `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'**.

Explanation: The code `hd -= 1` decrements the value of `hd` by 1. The values of `i` and `res` are updated based on the conditions given in the initial state, but since no new conditions are introduced by this line of code, the conditions for `i` and `res` remain the same.
