Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2, and `j` is at least `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was either 0 or 1, after incrementing, `i` becomes 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged because the code only modifies `i`. Therefore, `j` is still either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2, and it must still be at least `i + 1`, which now means `j` must be at least 2.
