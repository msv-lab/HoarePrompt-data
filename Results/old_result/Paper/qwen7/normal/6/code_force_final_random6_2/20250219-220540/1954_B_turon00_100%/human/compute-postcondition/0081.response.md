Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value of `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given state, `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - The value of `n` is an input integer.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `i` and `n`, these are the only variables that need to be adjusted.
   - Initially, `i` is set to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be set to a value less than `n`.

5. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `n` remains an input integer, but its exact value is not specified in the context of the loop execution.

Therefore, the final adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `n` is an input integer**
