Output State: The loop has executed for all iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to the total number of test cases entered. For each test case, the value of `A` is the last input integer provided, `B` is the second input integer, and `C` is the third input integer. Depending on the conditions met within the loop:

- If `B * 2 < C`, the output for that test case was `A * B`.
- If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, the output for that test case was `int(A * C / 2)`.
- If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, the output for that test case was `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`.

The final state of the loop will reflect these outputs for each test case, with `i` being the total number of iterations completed.
