Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 3) / 3 + 1`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n / 2 - 3`**

Explanation: The code `countmins = count - 1` decreases the value of `countmins` by 1. Initially, `countmins` was 3, so now it is 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
