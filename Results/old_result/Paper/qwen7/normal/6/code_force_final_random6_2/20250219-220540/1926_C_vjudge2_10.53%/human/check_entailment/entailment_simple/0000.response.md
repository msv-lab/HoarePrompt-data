### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly initializes by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and storing the values of `n` for each test case in a list called `numbers`.

2. **Preprocessing Values and Sum Values**:
   - The code initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, which are used to store the sum of digits for numbers up to `max(numbers)`. This preprocessing step is intended to optimize the calculation of the sum of digits for any number up to `max(numbers)`.

3. **Sum of Digits Calculation**:
   - For each number from 10 to `n`, the code correctly calculates the sum of digits using the previously computed values. However, there is a mistake in how the sum of digits is calculated for numbers greater than 9. Specifically, the logic for splitting the number into its last digit and the remaining part is flawed. For instance, when calculating the sum of digits for 19, it should be `1 + 9 = 10`, but the current implementation incorrectly adds `values[9]` and `values[1]`, which does not represent the actual sum of digits.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - The code correctly prints the sum of the numbers after replacing each number with the sum of its digits for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The given program is **incorrect** because the logic for calculating the sum of digits for numbers greater than 9 is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly compute the sum of digits for multi-digit numbers.

### Response:

Correctness: **False**
