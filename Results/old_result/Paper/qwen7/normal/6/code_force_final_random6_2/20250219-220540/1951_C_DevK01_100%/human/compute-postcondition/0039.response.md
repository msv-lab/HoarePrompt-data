The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, the variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration if it was inside a loop. The conditions and values of the variables outside the loop context are not affected.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers where `L[0]` is the length of the list `N`, `L[1]` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, and `L[2]` is the third element of `L`. `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`. If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
