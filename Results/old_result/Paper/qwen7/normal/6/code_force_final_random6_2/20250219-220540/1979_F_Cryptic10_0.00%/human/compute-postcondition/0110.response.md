Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` and constructs a path containing all vertices from 1 to `n` that satisfy certain conditions. It uses a loop to iterate through possible values of `d` from `n-1` down to `-1`, calling another function `func_1(d)` to get pairs of vertices `(v, u)`. If `v` is found in the set of remaining vertices, it is added to the path and removed from the set. After processing all vertices, it prints the path and ensures the set of remaining vertices is empty.**
