Output State: **`i` is 10; `word` is '10'; `last` is 0**

Explanation: The code extracts the last character from the string `word` which is '0', converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `last`. Since '0' is the last character of the string '10', `last` becomes 0. The values of `i` and `word` remain unchanged.
