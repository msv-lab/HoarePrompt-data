You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
def func_2(n):
    path = []
    remaining_vertices = set(range(1, n + 1))
    while remaining_vertices:
        for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            v, u = func_1(d)
            if v == 0:
                continue
            if v in remaining_vertices:
                path.append(v)
                remaining_vertices.remove(v)
                break
        
    #State: Output State: `d` is -1, `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations, `path` contains all vertices that satisfy the given conditions, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set since all vertices from 1 to `n` have been processed and added to `path`.
    #
    #In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning it has iterated through all possible values of `d` from `n-1` down to `-1`. The variable `d` will have reached `-1`, indicating the end of the loop. The variable `v` will hold the last value returned by `func_1(-1)`, and `u` will hold the corresponding second return value. The `path` list will contain all the vertices that met the condition of being in `remaining_vertices` and were successfully appended to `path` before being removed from `remaining_vertices`. Finally, `remaining_vertices` will be an empty set because all vertices from 1 to `n` have been processed.
    print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")
    #This is printed: ! path (where path contains all vertices that satisfied the given conditions)
    sys.stdout.flush()
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 2 to 10^5, and returns `n` if it is within this range. If `n` is outside this range, it returns an error message.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
