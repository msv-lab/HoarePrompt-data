Output State: `i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 10; `ind` is `n+1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` by 2 each iteration until `i` reaches `n-1`. Given that the loop has executed three times, incrementing `i` by 2 each time, we can deduce that `n` must be at least 11 (since it starts at 1 and increments by 2 each iteration). After 3 iterations, `i` would be 5, and since the loop continues to increment `i` by 2, the next value of `i` before the loop exits would be `n-1`. The variable `ind` starts at 1 and is incremented by 2 each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `ind` would be 7. Continuing the pattern, after all iterations, `ind` would be `n + 1`.
