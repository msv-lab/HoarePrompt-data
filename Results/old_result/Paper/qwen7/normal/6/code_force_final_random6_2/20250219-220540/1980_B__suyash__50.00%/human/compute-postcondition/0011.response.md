The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string from the user, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `a.split()` to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `b`, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split(), `f` is the second element of the list `b`, `k` is the third element of the list `b`, and `k` is equal to the value of `n`.**
