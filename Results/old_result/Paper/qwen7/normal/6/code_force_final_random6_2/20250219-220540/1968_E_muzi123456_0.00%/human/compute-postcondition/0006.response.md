Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be 1. Therefore, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
