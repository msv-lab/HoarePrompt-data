Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether any two consecutive elements in `num` are different, and either `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.**

Explanation: The code `onum.reverse()` reverses the list `onum`. The values of `j`, `n`, `f`, and `num` remain unchanged. The only change is that `onum` is now a reversed version of its original state.
