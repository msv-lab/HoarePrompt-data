Output State: **`ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, and all other variables retain their values from the precondition.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. It also increases `cnt` by `v[i]` and increments `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
