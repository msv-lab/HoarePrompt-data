Output State: `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is 0; `left` contains the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element; `last` still contains `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`; `a` is a non-empty list; `n` is greater than 1; `inx` remains unchanged.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be set to 0 since it starts from `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `left` list will contain the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element because the loop appends the sum of the last element of `left` and the current element `i` for each iteration. The `last` list will still contain `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`, and `ans` will remain a list of length `n` filled with -1, except for specific indices as described.
