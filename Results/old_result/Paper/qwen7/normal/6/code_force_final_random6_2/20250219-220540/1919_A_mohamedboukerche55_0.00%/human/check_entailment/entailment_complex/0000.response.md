Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. The key issue lies in the fact that the program simply checks whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints the corresponding result. However, the actual game rules dictate that the player who cannot make a valid move loses, and the optimal strategy involves exchanging wallets and removing one coin per turn.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the parity of the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The crucial observation is that the game essentially reduces to a Nim game where the player who faces a situation with both wallets having an equal number of coins (or one having zero coins) after their opponent's move will lose if both players play optimally.

Here's the correct approach:
- If `a` and `b` are both odd or both even, the player whose turn it is will eventually be forced into a losing position because they will always face a situation where the other player can make a move that leaves them in a losing position.
- If one of `a` or `b` is odd and the other is even, the player whose turn it is can always force the other player into a losing position by making strategic moves.

Given the provided examples and the explanation, the correct logic should be:
- If `a` and `b` are both odd or both even, the first player (Alice) will lose.
- If one of `a` or `b` is odd and the other is even, the first player (Alice) will win.

Therefore, the program should check the parity of `a` and `b` and determine the winner based on these conditions.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement this logic, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
