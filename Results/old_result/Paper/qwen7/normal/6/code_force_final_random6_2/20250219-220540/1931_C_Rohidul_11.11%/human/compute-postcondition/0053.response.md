Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
```
This means the loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
1. `l < r`
2. `a[l] == a[l + 1]`

### Current State
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` is 3
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `st` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)

### Conditions to Satisfy for Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
1. `l < r`
2. `a[l] == a[l + 1]`

Given `l` is currently 3, for the first condition `l < r` to remain true, `r` must be greater than 3. 

For the second condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` to remain true, `a[3]` must be equal to `a[4]`.

### Adjusting States
- The state of `l` and `r` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can continue.
- The state of `a[3]` and `a[4]` need to be adjusted to ensure the second condition remains true.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`l` and `r`), we need to ensure that `r` is greater than 3 and that the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` holds true for the next iteration.

### Final State Adjustment
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `r` to be greater than 3. Additionally, we need to ensure that `a[3]` is equal to `a[4]` for the second condition to hold.

Since we cannot directly change `a[3]` and `a[4]` within the constraints, we focus on adjusting `r` to ensure `l < r` remains true.

State: **`l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 3, `st` is 2**
