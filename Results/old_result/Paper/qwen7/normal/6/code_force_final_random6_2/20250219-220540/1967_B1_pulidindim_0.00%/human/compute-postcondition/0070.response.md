Output State: **`ans` is increased by `g / count + 1`, `g` is `n / count - countmins - 1`, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `count` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The values of `ans`, `g`, and `countmins` remain unchanged from their previous expressions. Therefore, `ans` is still increased by `g / count + 1`, `g` is still `n / count - countmins - 1`, and `countmins` is still `count - 1`. The only change is that `count` has been incremented by 1.
