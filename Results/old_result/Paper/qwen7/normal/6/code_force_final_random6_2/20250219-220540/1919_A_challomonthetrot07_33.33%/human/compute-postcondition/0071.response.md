Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the first and second input integers respectively. If `b` equals 1, no changes are made to `a` and `b`. Otherwise, if `a` is odd, `a` remains unchanged. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, no changes are made to `a` and `b`. In all other cases, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.
