Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, operations is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains two integers b and x such that b ∈ {1, 2}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and queries is a list of q integers k_i such that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after performing all operations.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
    print(*result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `queries` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `operations` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x such that b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `n` is the integer input for the number of operations, `q` is the integer input for the number of queries, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is incremented by 1, `n` is reduced by 1, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
