Output State: **`i` is 2, `temp` is [1, 3, 3], `max` remains as 3, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. The values of `i`, `temp`, `max`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `n` is the integer input provided by the user.
