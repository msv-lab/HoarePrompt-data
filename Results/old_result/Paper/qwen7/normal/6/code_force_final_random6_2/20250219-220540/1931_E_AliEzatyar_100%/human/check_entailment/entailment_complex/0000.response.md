Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the problem statement.
2. The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of the input number.
3. The main part of the program processes each test case and calculates whether Sasha or Anna will win based on the total number of digits and the count of trailing zeros.
4. The logic for determining the winner is sound:
   - If the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the sum of trailing zeros (considered every two elements) is at least \(m+1\), Sasha wins.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.
5. The program handles all test cases as per the problem constraints and outputs the correct results.

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
