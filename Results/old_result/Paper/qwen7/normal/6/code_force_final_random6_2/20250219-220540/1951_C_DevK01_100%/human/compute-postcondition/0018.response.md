Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input string, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the current length of the list `N`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, `n` is the length of the list `N`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `cost` variable by adding to it the expression `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`. Here, `sum(N)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `N`, and the rest of the terms are calculated using the previously defined variables. The values of all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
