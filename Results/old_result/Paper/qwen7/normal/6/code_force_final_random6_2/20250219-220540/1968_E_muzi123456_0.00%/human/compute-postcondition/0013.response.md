Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
- `i` is explicitly defined as 3.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `i`.

Output: **3**
