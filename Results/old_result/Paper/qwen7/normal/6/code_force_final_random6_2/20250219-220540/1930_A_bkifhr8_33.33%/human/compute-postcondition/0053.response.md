Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be such that `i < n * 2`, which means `n` must be greater than 0.5 (since `1 < n * 2` implies `n > 0.5`).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 2.
   - The value of `n` must still satisfy the condition `i < n * 2`. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**.
