Based on the initial state provided:

- `numbers` is a non-empty list.
- `n` is the second element of `numbers`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(sum_values[n])
```

Here, `sum_values` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its contents directly from the given information. However, since `n` is the second element of `numbers`, we know that `n` is an index into `sum_values`. 

Given this, the output will depend on the value of `sum_values[n]`. Since we do not have the specific values of `sum_values`, we can only describe it in terms of the index.

Output: **sum_values[n]** (where `n` is the second element of the list `numbers`)
