Reasoning:

1. The annotated program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. It then iterates through the array to check if any element greater than 10 exists. If such an element is found, it splits the element into its individual digits and rearranges the list accordingly.
4. After processing the array, it calls the function `func_1` to check if the resulting array is sorted.
5. The function `func_1` simply checks if the list is sorted and returns `True` or `False`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic in the main part of the program:

- The program does not actually attempt to sort the array using the specified operation. Instead, it only checks if the array is already sorted after a single pass through the array.
- The splitting and insertion of digits is done in a way that assumes the array will become sorted after one operation, which is not guaranteed. The program does not ensure that the array will eventually become sorted through repeated operations.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
