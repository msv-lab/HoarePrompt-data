Output State: **`i` is 3, `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 489, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10]**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`, and `subseq_lens`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
