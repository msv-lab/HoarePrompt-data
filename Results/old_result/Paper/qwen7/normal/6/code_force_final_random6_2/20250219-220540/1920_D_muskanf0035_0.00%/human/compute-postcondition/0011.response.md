Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` is reduced by 1, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `t` is incremented by 1 and `n` is reduced by 1 before the function call, and `q` and `queries` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these updated values along with the fact that `result` is the return value of the function call.
