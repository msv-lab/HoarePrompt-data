Output State: **`counter` is 0, `num` is a sequence-like object with a length greater than 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since `i` has already been decremented to 0 and the condition `num[i] != '0'` would have been checked, the `break` statement causes us to exit the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `counter`, `num`, or `i`.
