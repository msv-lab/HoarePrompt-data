Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` and `b` are both lists.
   - `cp` is 0.
   - `i` is the length of `b` or `len(b) + 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one.
   - `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces.
   - `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `None`.
   - `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the length of `b` or `len(b) + 1`, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is the length of `b` or `len(b) + 1`.
- To ensure the loop continues, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` and `b` are both lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is len(`b`) + 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `None`, `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty.**
