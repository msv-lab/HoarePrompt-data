Postcondition: `i` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4`, `n` is an integer, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `y[-1]` which is equal to `k`. After executing the if-else block, `y[i]` is updated to either `k * a[q2] % m` (if `t[i] == 'R'` and `q2` is incremented by 1) or `k * a[q1] % m` (if `t[i] != 'R'` and `q1` is decremented by 1).
