Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program aims to minimize the penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences `s` and `t`, but it does not correctly calculate the penalties for these subsequences.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the penalties for the two subsequences by tracking the minimum values (`a` and `b`) and counting how many times a new minimum value is encountered. However, this approach does not directly translate to calculating the number of indices `i` where `b_i < b_{i+1}` for the subsequences `s` and `t`.

2. **Splitting Logic**: The program tries to split the array into two parts by maintaining two variables `a` and `b` to track the minimum values. It increments `c` when a new minimum value is found, which is not equivalent to calculating the penalties `p(s)` and `p(t)`.

To correctly solve the problem, one should sort the array and then split it at a point that minimizes the combined penalties of the two resulting subsequences. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        l.sort()
        
        # Calculate the penalty for the sorted array
        penalty = sum(1 for i in range(n-1) if l[i] < l[i+1])
        
        print(penalty)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution sorts the array and calculates the penalty directly, which is the correct approach to finding the minimum possible penalty.
