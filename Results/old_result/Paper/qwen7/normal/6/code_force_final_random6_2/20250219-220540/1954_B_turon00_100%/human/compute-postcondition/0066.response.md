Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `cnt` will be 0, `n` will be the input integer but decreased by the number of iterations (which is `n`), `t` will be decreased by `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` will be equal to `a[0]`, `ans` will be equal to the minimum value between itself and `cnt` for each iteration, and `i` will be equal to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `cnt` will reset to 0, `n` will be reduced to 0, `t` will also be reduced by the original value of `n`, `tmp` remains as the first element of the list `a`, `ans` will hold the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found during the loop's execution, and `i` will be the last index of the list `a`.
