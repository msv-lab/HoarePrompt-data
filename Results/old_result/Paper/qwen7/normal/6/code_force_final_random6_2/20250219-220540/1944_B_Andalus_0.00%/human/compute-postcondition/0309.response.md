Output State: `sz` is 9, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, and the first three elements in the list are the `elem`s printed during each iteration of the loop.

This means that the loop continues to execute as long as `sz` (which starts at 5) is less than `k` (which is 3), but since `sz` increases by 1 with each iteration, it will eventually reach 9 before the condition `sz >= k` is met, causing the loop to break. By that point, `sz` would have incremented from its initial value of 5 through 6, 7, 8, and finally 9, which is 4 increments total. Therefore, the loop executes 4 times, printing 4 elements from the list `sng`, making sure `sng` has at least 4 elements, and `sz` becomes 9.
