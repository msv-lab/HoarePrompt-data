Postcondition: **`sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb`; `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `b`; `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original integer values such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `m` ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `a[:m]`; `ans` is 0; the condition `sm >= k` is true**.
