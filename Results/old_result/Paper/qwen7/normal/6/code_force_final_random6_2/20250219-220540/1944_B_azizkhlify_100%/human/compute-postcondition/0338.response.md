Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is stated to be greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified and it does not affect the print statement directly.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a` is a list, and `i` is used as an index to access the element at position 2 in the list `a`. Since the value of `a` itself is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[2]`.

However, we can describe the output based on the information available:
Output: **[value at index 2 of list a]**
