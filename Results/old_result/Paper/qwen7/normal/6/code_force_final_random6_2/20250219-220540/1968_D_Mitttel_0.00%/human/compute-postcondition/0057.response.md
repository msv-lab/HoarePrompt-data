Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code calculates the number of full cycles (`full_cycles`) that can be completed with the given `remaining_steps` by performing integer division (`//`). The value of `remaining_steps` is updated to reflect the number of steps used in completing these full cycles. The variables `cycle_score` and `cycle_pos` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
