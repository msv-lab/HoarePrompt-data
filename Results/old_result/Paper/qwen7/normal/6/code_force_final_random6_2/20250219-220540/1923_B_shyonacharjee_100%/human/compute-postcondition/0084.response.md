Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health`, `can_survive` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`.**

Explanation: The line `bullets_used += health` increases the value of `bullets_used` by the value of `health`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
