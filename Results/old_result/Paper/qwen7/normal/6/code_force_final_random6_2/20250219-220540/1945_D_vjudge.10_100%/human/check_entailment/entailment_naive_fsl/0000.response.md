Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the case where Kirill needs to move multiple positions at once to reach his desired position within the first `m` people. 

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Kirill needs to move from position 4 to position 2.
  - He can move from position 4 to position 3 for 5 coins, and then from position 3 to position 2 for 3 coins.
  - Total cost: 5 + 3 = 8 coins.

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program calculates the total cost as 14 coins, which is incorrect.

### Issue:
The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for the cumulative cost of moving through intermediate positions. It only considers the cost of moving directly to the target position without considering the intermediate steps.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the program correctly accumulates the costs for each step in the sequence of moves. This requires a more detailed approach to calculate the minimum cost path from Kirill's initial position to any position within the first `m` people.
