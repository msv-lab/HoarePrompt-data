Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `pergunta` is the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`, `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`, if `i < m`, `pergunta` and `x` retain these updates, if `i >= m`, the values of `pergunta` and `x` remain unchanged from their preconditions.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `pergunta` to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`.
- It also updates `x` to be `x + min(a[i], b[i])`.
- The condition `if i < m` determines whether `pergunta` and `x` retain these updates or remain unchanged.
- Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `pergunta`, `x`, `a`, `b`, and `m`, the output state reflects the changes made by the code while keeping the conditions intact.
