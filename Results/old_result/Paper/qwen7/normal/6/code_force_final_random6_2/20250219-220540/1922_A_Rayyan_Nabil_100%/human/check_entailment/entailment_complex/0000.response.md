### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each character in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` up to length `n`.
   - It checks if there exists an index `i` where both `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` are true.
   - If such an index is found, it immediately returns 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes without finding such an index, it returns 'NO'.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes up to 1000 test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`).
   - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

3. **Problem Description and Functionality Check**:
   - The problem requires determining if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match it but `c` does not.
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by checking if there is an index where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the appropriate results based on the output of `func_1`.

Given the analysis, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly implement the required functionality as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
