Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation, and `a` is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**

The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. The original values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new variable `data` is created and assigned the split result.
