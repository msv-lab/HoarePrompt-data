Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by the parameters `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a minimum value involving elements from lists `a` and `b`, and updates a variable `pergunta` accordingly. Specifically, it iterates through the elements of `a` and `b` in reverse order, updating `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of another variable `x` and the current element of `a`. The variable `x` accumulates the minimum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`. After processing all elements, the function prints the final value of `pergunta`.**
