Output State: The loop will continue to execute for as many lines of input as provided, with each iteration processing a new line. For each line, `n` and `k` are integers where `n` is between 2 and \(10^8\) inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and \(4n - 2\) inclusive. After processing all lines, the loop will terminate, and the final output will consist of a series of results based on the formula given in the loop body. Each result is printed on a new line, corresponding to the input line it was derived from.

In more detail, for each input line, the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` is evaluated and printed. This expression calculates a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is less than \(4n - 3\), it computes \(\frac{k}{2} + \text{remainder when } k \text{ is divided by } 2\). If `k` is greater than or equal to \(4n - 3\), it computes \(2n\). Additionally, if `k` is exactly \(4n - 2\), it adds 1 to the result.
