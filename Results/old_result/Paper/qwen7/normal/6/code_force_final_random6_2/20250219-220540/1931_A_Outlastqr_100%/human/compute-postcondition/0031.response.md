Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'aay', `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `word` to the string `'aay'`. This overrides the previous definition of `word` based on the value of `n`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
