Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `num in arr`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is increased by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples that must not be empty.
   - `num` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.
   - `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.
   - `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand what happens in the loop**:
   - `num` is set to the next element in `arr`.
   - `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` are updated based on the new `num`.
   - `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the first element of `arr` in the previous iteration, it will be the second element in the next iteration.
   - `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` will be updated based on the new `num`.
   - `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` will be incremented by 1.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `arr` must still be a non-empty list.
   - `num` will be the second element of `arr`.
   - `mod_x_key` will be `num % x`.
   - `mod_y_key` will be `num % y`.
   - `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`count` is increased by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `arr` is a list of tuples that must not be empty, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1**
