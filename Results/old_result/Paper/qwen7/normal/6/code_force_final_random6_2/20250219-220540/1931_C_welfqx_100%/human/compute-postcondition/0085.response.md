Postcondition: `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. If the element at index `j` in `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1` in `num`, then `f` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the elements are equal, no changes are made to `f` and the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block.
