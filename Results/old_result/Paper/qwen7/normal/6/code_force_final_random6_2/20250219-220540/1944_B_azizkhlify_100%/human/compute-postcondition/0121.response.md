Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is unchanged, `2 * n` is unchanged, `ur` is `ur + 4`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and if `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` updates the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Since `a[i] - 1` was previously 0 (from the initial state), this assignment does not change the value of `r[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
