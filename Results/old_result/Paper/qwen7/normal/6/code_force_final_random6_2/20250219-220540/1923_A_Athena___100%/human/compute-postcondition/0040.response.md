Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` must have at least 3 elements, `res` is 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `a` must have at least 3 elements remains valid. The value of `res` stays as 3, and `i` remains 2.
