Postcondition: `initial_iterations - 3` is the number of remaining iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is equal to either `l[x]` or `l[x+1]` depending on the condition, `b` is equal to `l[x+1]` if `l[x] <= a` or `l[x]`, otherwise, and `c` is 1 if `l[x+1]` is greater than `b` or `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` remains 0.
