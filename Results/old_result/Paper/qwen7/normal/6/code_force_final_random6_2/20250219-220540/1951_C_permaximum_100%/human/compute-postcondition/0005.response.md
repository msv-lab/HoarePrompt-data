The only variables in the loop head are `tickets_bought` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `tickets_bought < k`. Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0, and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

For the loop to execute the first time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`. Since `tickets_bought` is currently 0, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`tickets_bought` is 0, `total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, and `price_increase` is 0**
