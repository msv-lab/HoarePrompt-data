Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `not vis[s] and k > 0`.
2. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - `vis[s]`: This must be 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `k`: This must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`.
- `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`.
- `k` is decreased by 1 (now `k-1`).
- `vis[s]` is 1.
- `s` is updated to `p[s]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust:
- `vis[s]` to 0.
- `k` to be greater than 0.

Since `k` is already `k-1` and we don't know its exact value, we just need to ensure it is still positive. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for `k` beyond ensuring it was greater than 0 before the decrement.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `vis[s]` must be 0.
- `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `vis[s]` is 0, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**
