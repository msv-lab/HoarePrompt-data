Functionality: **The function processes multiple inputs in a loop. For each input, it reads two integers \( t \) and \( n \), followed by a string \( s \). If \( n \) is 2, it checks if \( s \) is '00'. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If \( n \) is not 2, it counts the number of '1's in \( s \). If the count of '1's is odd or if there is exactly one instance of '11' in \( s \), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all inputs, the function prints 'NO' for any remaining iterations where \( n \neq 2 \) and the count of '1's is even, or if \( s \) contains exactly one instance of '11'.**
