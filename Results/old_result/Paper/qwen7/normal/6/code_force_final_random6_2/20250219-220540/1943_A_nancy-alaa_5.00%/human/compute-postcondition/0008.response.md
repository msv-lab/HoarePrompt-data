Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a nested structure. In this case, since there is no loop or nested structure being explicitly mentioned, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `mpp`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as in the initial state.
