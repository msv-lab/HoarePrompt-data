Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are lists of n integers where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `x` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `x` to 0, which does not affect the values of `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, or their constraints. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `x` being set to 0.
