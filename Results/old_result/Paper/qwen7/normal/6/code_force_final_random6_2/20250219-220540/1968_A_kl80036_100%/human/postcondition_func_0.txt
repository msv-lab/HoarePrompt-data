The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads the values of `t` and `x`, calculates `y` as `x - 1`, and prints `y`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but leaves the program in a state where the last printed value is `x - 1` for the last test case provided.
