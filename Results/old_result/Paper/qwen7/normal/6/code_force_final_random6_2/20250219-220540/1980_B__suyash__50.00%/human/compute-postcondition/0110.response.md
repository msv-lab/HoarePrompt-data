Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `len(l)` is greater than 0, meaning the list `l` is not empty.
- `fav` is equal to the first element of `l`.
- `k` is decreased by `dic[l[0]]`, where `dic[l[0]]` is the value associated with the first element of `l` in the dictionary `dic`.
- `k` is greater than or equal to 0.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
