Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\)**.

Explanation: The code calculates `q` as \(2\) raised to the power of one less than the length of the binary string representation of `k`. Since the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `p` are not changed by the code, they remain as described in the initial state. The new variable `q` is calculated based on the value of `p`.
