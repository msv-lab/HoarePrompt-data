Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the functions needed to solve the problem.
2. `func_2()` reads the input and processes it by calling `func_1()` for each test case.
3. `func_1()` calculates the scores for both players using the `calculate_score()` function.
4. `calculate_score()` correctly handles both non-cyclic and cyclic scenarios by:
   - Summing the scores along the path until a cycle is detected.
   - Handling the remaining steps after detecting a cycle.
5. The logic in `func_1()` compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the detailed analysis of the program and the provided comments, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and should work as intended for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
