Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum number \( k \) such that we can partition the array into \( k \) segments where the bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of these segments is less than or equal to \( x \).
- Function `func_1` is supposed to call `find_max` with the entire array and the highest bit position (31), but instead, it incorrectly returns the length of the array, which is not relevant to the problem.
- Function `find_max` is designed to correctly process the array and find the maximum \( k \) by considering each bit position from 30 down to 0. However, the logic inside `find_max` is implemented correctly to achieve the desired result.

Given the above analysis:
- `func_1` should call `find_max` with the correct parameters to solve the problem.
- `find_max` correctly implements the logic to solve the problem for each bit position.

Since `func_1` is not correctly calling `find_max` with the required parameters, the overall program will not produce the correct results.

Correctness: **False**
