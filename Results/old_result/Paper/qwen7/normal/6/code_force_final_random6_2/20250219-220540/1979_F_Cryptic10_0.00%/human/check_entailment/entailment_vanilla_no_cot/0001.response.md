Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function prints a query `? d` and reads the response.
   - It returns a tuple `(v, u)` where `v` is the vertex with the minimum degree at least `d`, and `u` is the vertex that `v` is not connected to (or 0 if no such vertex exists).
   - The function uses `sys.stdout.flush()` to ensure the query is sent immediately.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using up to `n` queries.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices in the Hamiltonian path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices.
   - It enters a loop that continues until all vertices are processed.
     - For each degree `d` from `n-1` down to 0, it calls `func_1(d)`.
     - If `v` is 0, it skips to the next iteration.
     - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
   - After constructing the path, it prints the path and flushes the output buffer.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the queries by calling `func_1(d)` for each degree `d` from `n-1` down to 0.
   - It ensures that the vertex `v` added to the path is the one with the minimum degree at least `d` and the smallest number among those vertices.
   - The removal of vertex `v` and its edges is handled correctly by removing `v` from `remaining_vertices`.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program constructs the Hamiltonian path by iteratively selecting vertices with the minimum degree and ensuring they are not already in the path.
   - The path construction logic is sound and should work as intended for finding a Hamiltonian path.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `v` is 0 (indicating no suitable vertex with the required degree) by continuing to the next iteration.
   - The program ensures that the path is constructed using at most `n` queries, as required by the problem constraints.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the problem requirements correctly. It constructs a Hamiltonian path using the allowed queries and ensures that the path is valid and constructed within the given constraints.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
