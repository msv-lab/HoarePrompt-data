Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`
- `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop starts from `i = n-1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` becomes -1.

### Current Values
- `i` is currently `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `pergunta` has been updated to include the minimum value between its current value and `x + a[i]`
- `x` has been updated to include the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`

### Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `n-2`.

### Adjusted States
- `i` will be `n-2`
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1 (since it hasn't changed)
- `pergunta` will now be updated to include the minimum value between its current value and `x + a[n-2]`
- `x` will now be updated to include the minimum value between `a[n-2]` and `b[n-2]`

### Final State
State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[n-2]`, `x` is `x + min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`**
