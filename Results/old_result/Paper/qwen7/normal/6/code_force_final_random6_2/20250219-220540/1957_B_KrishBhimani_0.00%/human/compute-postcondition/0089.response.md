Output State: **`i` is 16, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768], `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is `k0 - sum(ans)` and the second element is 65536, `c` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- `ans.append(1 << i)` appends \(2^i\) (which is 65536 since \(i = 16\)) to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` is \([k0 - \text{sum(ans)}]\).
- After appending, `ans` becomes \([k0 - \text{sum(ans)}, 65536]\).
- The value of `i` remains 16.
- The value of `arr` remains unchanged.
- The value of `c` is increased by 1, so it now equals `n - 1`.
