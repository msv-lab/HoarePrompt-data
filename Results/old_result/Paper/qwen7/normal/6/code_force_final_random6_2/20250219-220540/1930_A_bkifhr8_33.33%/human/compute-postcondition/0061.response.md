Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - Postcondition: If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` added to its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and the second element of `lst` has been removed at index 1.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n * 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is 2 and the loop condition is `i < n * 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as the loop condition does not directly depend on `n` changing within the loop itself (it is only checked once at the start).

5. **Postcondition Consideration:**
   - The postcondition does not affect the loop execution directly but provides context about the state of `lst` and `ans`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be less than `n * 2`. Given that `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute at least one more time.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 3.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**
