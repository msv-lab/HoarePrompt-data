Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop condition is `i in range(1, n, 2)`.
   - This means `i` should start from 1 and increment by 2 until it reaches a value less than `n`.

3. **Check the given state**:
   - `ind` is 1 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `i` is equal to `n` (this is not consistent with the loop condition since `i` should start from 1).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 10.
   - `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `p[8]` which is `n`, `p[12]` is `8`, and every second index starting from 8 up to but not including `n` will contain values decrementing by 2 from `n` to 6.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` should start from 1, we need to set `i` to 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 10 as stated.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10**
