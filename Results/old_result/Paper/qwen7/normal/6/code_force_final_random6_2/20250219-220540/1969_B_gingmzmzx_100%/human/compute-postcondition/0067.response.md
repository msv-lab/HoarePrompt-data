Postcondition: `c` is the first element of `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated based on the following rules: if `c` is 0, then `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, else `ans` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is incremented by the difference between the number of zeroes (`zeroes`) and the count of 0s (`cnt[0]`).
