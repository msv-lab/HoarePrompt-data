Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 8.
   - `bets` must be greater than 8.
   - `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[8]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < bets`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `8 + 1 = 9`.

5. **Determine the new condition for the loop to continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `bets`. Therefore, `bets` must remain greater than 9.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 9.
   - `bets` must be greater than 9 (since it was greater than 8 and `i` is now 9).

7. **Note about `sumo`**: The value of `sumo` is not directly affected by the loop itself but by the operation `sumo += prod // a[8]`. This value does not change based on the loop condition, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 9, `bets` must be greater than 9**
