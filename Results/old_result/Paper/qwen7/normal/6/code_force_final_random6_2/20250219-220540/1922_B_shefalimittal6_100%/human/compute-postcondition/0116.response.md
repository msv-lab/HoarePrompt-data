Output State: **`idx` is increased by 1 again; `v[x]` is increased by 1; `x` is an integer from `data[idx]` and `idx` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Since `idx` was previously increased by 1 again, it is now increased by 2. The values of `v[x]` and `x` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code. `x` is still an integer from `data[idx]`, but since `idx` has increased, `x` is now an integer from `data[idx]` where `idx` is the new value of `idx`.
