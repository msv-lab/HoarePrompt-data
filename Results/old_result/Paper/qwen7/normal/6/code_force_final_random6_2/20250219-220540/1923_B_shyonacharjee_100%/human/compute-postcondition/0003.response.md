Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3 â‹… 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input using `input()`, splits it into a list of strings using `.split()`, and then converts each string in the list to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `k` is also unchanged.
