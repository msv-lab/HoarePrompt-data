Postcondition: **`cycle_start`, `current_pos`, `score`, `steps`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, `remainder_steps`, and `p` are as follows: if a cycle is detected (`cycle_start != -1`), `full_cycles` is the quotient of `remaining_steps` divided by `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is the remainder of `k - steps` when divided by `cycle_length`, `cycle_score` and `cycle_pos` remain unchanged, `remainder_steps` is reduced by the total number of iterations minus one, `score` is the initial score plus the product of `full_cycles` and `cycle_score`, plus the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration, and `current_pos` is updated according to the rule `current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration. If no cycle is detected (`cycle_start == -1`), the state remains unchanged.**
