### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Representation and Query Handling**:
   - The problem involves finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph where some edges are missing. The graph is initially a complete graph with \( n \) vertices, and exactly \( n - 2 \) edges are removed.
   - The function `func_1(d)` is designed to query the graph about the degree of vertices and provide information about a specific vertex with the minimum degree that does not have an edge to another specified vertex.
   - The function `func_2(n)` uses these queries to construct a Hamiltonian path.

2. **Function `func_1(d)`**:
   - This function correctly prints the query `? d` and reads the response, returning the vertex `v` and the non-adjacent vertex `u`.
   - The logic ensures that if `v` is 0, it skips further processing for that iteration.

3. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - It initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
   - It iterates over possible degrees from \( n - 1 \) down to 0.
   - For each degree, it calls `func_1(d)` and processes the result:
     - If `v` is 0, it skips to the next iteration.
     - If `v` is in the set of remaining vertices, it adds `v` to the path and removes it from the set.
   - The loop continues until all vertices are processed and added to the path.
   - Finally, it prints the path in the required format.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that the number of queries does not exceed \( n \).
   - The interaction protocol is followed, including flushing the output buffer after each query and response.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path using the provided queries and adheres to the problem constraints.
