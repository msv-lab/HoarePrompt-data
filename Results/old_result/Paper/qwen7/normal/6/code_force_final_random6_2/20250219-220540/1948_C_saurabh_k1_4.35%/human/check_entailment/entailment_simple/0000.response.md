Reasoning:
1. The program iterates over each test case using a loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, which is the number of columns in the grid.
3. It then reads two strings, `a` and `b`, which represent the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
4. The program checks if the second-to-last character in the second row (`b[n-2]`) is `<`. If it is, the program prints 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).
5. Otherwise, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that the robot can potentially reach the cell (2, n).

However, the logic in the program is flawed because it only checks the second-to-last character in the second row. This check does not guarantee that the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The robot must follow the arrows correctly and move through the grid to reach the target cell.

To determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), we need to simulate the movement of the robot through the grid and ensure that it can follow the arrows to reach the target cell. The provided program does not perform this simulation.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **False**
