Output State: **`ans` is either the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[1]) - 1`, or `0 + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, depending on whether the length of `lst` is not 2, plus `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`; `i` is 1; `n` is a positive integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `ans`, `i`, or `n`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
