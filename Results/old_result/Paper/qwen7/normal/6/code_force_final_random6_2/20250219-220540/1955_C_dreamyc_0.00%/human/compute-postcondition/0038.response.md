Output State: **`nums` is a deque with one more element at the beginning compared to its original state, `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, and `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state. `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the left side of the deque `nums`. This changes the state of `nums` by adding one more element at the beginning. The values of `a`, `b`, `ans`, `t`, `k`, `n`, `x`, and the condition regarding `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
