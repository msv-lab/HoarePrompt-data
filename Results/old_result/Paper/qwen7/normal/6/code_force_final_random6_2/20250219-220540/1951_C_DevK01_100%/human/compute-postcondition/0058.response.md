Output State: **`n` is the length of `N`, `t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers where `L[0]` is the length of the list `M`, `L[1]` is the minimum value between the input integers, and `L[2]` is the third element of `L`, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from input, `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the smaller value between `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, and the loop continues.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of all variables remain unchanged. The loop simply continues its execution from the beginning of the next iteration.
