Output State: **`cw` is `True`, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is `len(nums) - 3`, `nw` is `True`**.

The code `cw = True` simply reassigns the value of `cw` to `True`. Since `cw` was already `True` if `nums[i]` is not equal to 1 and `False` if `nums[i]` equals 1, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged.
