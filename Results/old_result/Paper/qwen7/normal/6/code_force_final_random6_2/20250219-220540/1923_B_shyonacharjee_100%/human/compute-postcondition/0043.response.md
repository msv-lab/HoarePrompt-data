Output State: **`monsters` is a list of tuples, `pos` is the first element of the first tuple in the list, `health` is the second element of the first tuple in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`**.

This means that the `total_bullets_needed` variable is now assigned the value of `bullets_used + health`, where `bullets_used` and `health` are derived from the first tuple in the `monsters` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
