Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`. Given that the loop was able to run up to the third iteration, `n` must be at least 3. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
