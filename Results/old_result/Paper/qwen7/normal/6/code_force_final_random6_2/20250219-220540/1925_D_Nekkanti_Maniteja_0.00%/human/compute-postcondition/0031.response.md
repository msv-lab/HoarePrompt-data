Output State: **`i` is 100000, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 100000, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0.**

The code initializes `s` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `M`, or `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values, and `s` is set to 0.
