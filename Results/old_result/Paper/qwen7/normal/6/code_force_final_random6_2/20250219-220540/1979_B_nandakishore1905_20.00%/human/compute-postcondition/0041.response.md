Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. The value of `i` remains as `i + 1` from the initial state, and `n` and `m` retain their input integer values.
