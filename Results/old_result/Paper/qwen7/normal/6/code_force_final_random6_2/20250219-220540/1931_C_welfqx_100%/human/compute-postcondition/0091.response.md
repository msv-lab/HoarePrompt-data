Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.
   - For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2.

3. **Check the Condition Inside the Loop:**
   - The condition inside the loop checks if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`.
   - If this condition is true, `f` is set to 0 and the loop is broken out.
   - If the condition is false (i.e., `num[j]` is equal to `num[j + 1]`), no changes are made to `f`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, `j` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition does not depend on modifying `n` directly; it just needs to be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
