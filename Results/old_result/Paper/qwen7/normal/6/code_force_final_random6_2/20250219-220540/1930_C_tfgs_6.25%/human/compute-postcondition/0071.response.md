Output State: **`ans` is a list where the last element is now equal to the second last element minus 1, `cnt` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code appends the value of the last element of `ans` (which is `ans[-1]`) minus 1 to the list `ans`. Since the last element was already decreased by 1 before this operation, appending `ans[-1] - 1` to the list updates the last element accordingly. The precondition that `cnt` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
