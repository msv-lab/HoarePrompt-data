You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and n is not equal to 0. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `position` is 5, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. Each iteration of the loop performs two operations: `n >>= 1` (which means `n` is divided by 2 and truncated towards zero) and `position += 1`. Given that `n` becomes 0 after the third iteration, it implies that `n` was initially a power of 2 greater than or equal to 2^4 (since `n` became 0 after 4 divisions). Therefore, after 4 iterations, `position` will be 5, and `n` will be 0. The value of `t` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns 4



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program proceeds to generate a sequence.
   - If `n` is 1, the program simply prints `k`.

3. **Generating the Sequence**:
   - When `n > 1`, the program uses the function `func_1(k)` to determine the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - It then constructs the sequence as follows:
     - Adds `(2 ** counter - 1)` to the array. This is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the `counter`-th bit.
     - Adds `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to the array. This ensures the sum of the sequence is `k`.
     - Fills the rest of the array with zeros to make the length `n`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(n)` finds the position of the highest set bit in `n`.
   - It returns `position - 1` which is the index of the highest set bit minus one.

### Verification:

1. **Sum Constraint**:
   - The sum of the sequence should be `k`. The sequence `[2 ** counter - 1, k - (2 ** counter - 1)]` sums to `k` because `(2 ** counter - 1) + (k - (2 ** counter - 1)) = k`.

2. **Binary OR Operation**:
   - The bitwise OR of `(2 ** counter - 1)` and `(k - (2 ** counter - 1))` will have as many 1s as possible within the constraints of `k`.
   - Adding zeros at the end of the sequence does not affect the OR operation since zero has no bits set.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n = 1`, the program correctly prints `k` because there is only one element in the sequence.
   - When `n > 1`, the constructed sequence meets both the sum and the OR operation criteria.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement. It generates a sequence that satisfies both the sum condition and the maximum number of 1s in the binary OR operation.

Correctness: **True**
