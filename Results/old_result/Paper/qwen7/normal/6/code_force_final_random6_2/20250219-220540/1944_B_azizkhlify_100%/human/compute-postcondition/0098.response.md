Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant values `n` and `2 * n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` in the range from `n` to `2 * n`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `n` or any value within this range.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`. This means the initial value of `i` should be at least `n`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `n` initially.
   - The other variables (`res`, `ul`, `ur`, `l`, `a`, `k`) do not affect the loop's ability to start and are not adjusted in this context.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` must be `n`.
- `n` remains unchanged but is part of the loop condition.
- `2 * n` remains unchanged but is part of the loop condition.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged, `2 * n` is unchanged**.
