Reasoning:
1. **Tree Construction**: The program correctly constructs a tree from the input data. It reads the number of vertices \( n \) and the number of edges \( k \) to be removed, then adds the edges to the tree. The `root_tree_non_recursive` method ensures that the tree is properly rooted and that each node's subtree size is correctly calculated.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum \( x \)**: The `func_4` function uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges and ensure that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices. This is done by repeatedly calling `func_3` with different values of \( x \).

3. **Checking Good Components and Remaining Size**: The `func_3` function checks whether the current value of \( x \) allows for the removal of exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices. It uses the results from `func_1` to determine the number of good components and their remaining sizes.

4. **Postorder Traversal for Component Calculation**: The `func_1` function performs a postorder traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each component. This ensures that the calculations are done in the correct order, considering the hierarchical structure of the tree.

Given that the logic in each function is consistent with the problem statement and the steps required to solve the problem, the overall program should work correctly for the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
