Output State: **`cou` is 0**

The code initializes the variable `cou` to 0. Since the list `arr` has already been fully iterated over and the frequency counts in the `freq` list have been updated, the only change here is the initialization of `cou`. The initial state of `cou` being 0 remains unchanged by this line of code.
