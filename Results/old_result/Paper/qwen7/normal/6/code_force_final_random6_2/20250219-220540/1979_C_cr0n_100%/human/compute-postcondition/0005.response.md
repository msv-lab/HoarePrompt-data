Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in vals:`. This means the loop variable is `x` and it iterates over the list `vals`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `vals` is a list of `N` integers.
   - `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`.
   - `x` is the first element of `vals`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop starts with `x` being the first element of `vals`.
   - After the first iteration, `x` is updated to the next element in the list `vals`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the loop variable, it will be updated to the next element in `vals`.
   - `den` is calculated using `func_1(den, x)`, but since `x` is changing, `den` will be recalculated in the next iteration based on the new value of `x`.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `N` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
   - `vals` remains the same list of `N` integers.
   - `x` will be the second element of `vals` (since it was the first element in the previous iteration).
   - `den` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of `N` integers, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)` where `x` is the second element of `vals`**.

State: **`N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of `N` integers, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)` where `x` is the second element of `vals`**
