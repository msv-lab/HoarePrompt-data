Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 4, `x` is either `a[-1]` (which is either `lit[0]` or `x`) or infinity, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` (depending on whether `b` is empty or not); `b` now contains one additional element which is `lit[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `lit[i]` is `lit[3]`. Therefore, `b` now contains one additional element, which is `lit[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
