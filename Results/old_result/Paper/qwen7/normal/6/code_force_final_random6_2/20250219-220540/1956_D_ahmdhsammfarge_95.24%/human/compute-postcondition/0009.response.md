Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers where elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) are replaced by a list of `n` elements, each element being `l - r + 1`; `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`; `ops` is a list containing `[[r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`; `n` is `l - r + 1`.**

To explain further:
- The slice of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced with a list of `n` elements, each element being `l - r + 1`.
- The values of `r`, `l`, `ops`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The updated `lst` now contains the specified slice modified as described.
