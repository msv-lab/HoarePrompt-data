Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to generate a permutation based on the given rules. Let's analyze whether the logic correctly generates a valid permutation according to the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes an array `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It fills the even indices with values starting from `ind = n` and decrementing by 2.
   - It fills the odd indices with values starting from `ind = 1 + n % 2` and incrementing by 2.
   
   This approach ensures that the even and odd indexed elements are filled with distinct values, which is a key requirement for the problem.

3. **Divisibility Check**:
   - The constructed permutation ensures that no two pairs `(p_i, p_{i+1})` exist such that both `p_i` divides `p_{i+1}` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{i+2}`.
   - For even indices, the values are decreasing by 2, ensuring that no even-indexed value can divide another even-indexed value.
   - For odd indices, the values are increasing by 2, ensuring that no odd-indexed value can divide another odd-indexed value.
   - Since the even and odd indexed values are filled independently and do not overlap, the divisibility condition is satisfied.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly constructs a permutation that meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
