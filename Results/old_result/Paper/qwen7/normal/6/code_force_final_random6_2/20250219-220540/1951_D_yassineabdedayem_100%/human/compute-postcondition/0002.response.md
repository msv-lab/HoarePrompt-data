Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input; `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings based on spaces, and then converts these strings into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The first integer is assigned to `n` and the second to `k`. The condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
