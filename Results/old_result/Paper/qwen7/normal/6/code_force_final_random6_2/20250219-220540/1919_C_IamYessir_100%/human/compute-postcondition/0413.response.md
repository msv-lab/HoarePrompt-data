Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), and `b` is now a list with its last element equal to `lit[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 1, `lit[i]` is `lit[1]`. Since `i` is 1, the value of `lit[1]` is added to the list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
