Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `g` is updated to the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is updated to the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, `n` is updated to \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\), `x` is updated to \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\). If `x` is greater than `n`, the function continues with the condition that `x` remains greater than `n`. Otherwise, the function continues with the condition that `x` is not greater than `n`.
