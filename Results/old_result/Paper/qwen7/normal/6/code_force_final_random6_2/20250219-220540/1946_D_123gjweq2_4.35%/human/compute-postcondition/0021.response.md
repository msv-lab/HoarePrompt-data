Output State: **`xor` is equal to the first element of `cur_arr`; `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr` appended to it; `cur_arr` must have a length of at least 1.**

Explanation: The code `new_arr.append(xor)` appends the value of `xor` (which is equal to the first element of `cur_arr`) to the list `new_arr`. The value of `xor` remains unchanged, and the length of `cur_arr` is at least 1, so the condition is still valid.
