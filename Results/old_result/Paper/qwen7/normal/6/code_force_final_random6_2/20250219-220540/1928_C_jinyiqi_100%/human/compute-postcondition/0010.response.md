Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing 2 elements `[3, 3]`, `output2` is a list containing 1 element `[int(x / 3)]**.

Explanation: The code appends the integer division of `x` by `i` (which is 3) to `output2`. Since `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), the value of `int(x / 3)` will be an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
