Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements (one less than before), `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to the sum of `c` and `ele`.
