You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))

- Annotated Code: 
numCasos = int(input())
for i in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pergunta = float('inf')
    func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are lists of n integers where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` must remain greater than or equal to 1 as it was initially. The variable `pergunta` will hold the minimum value between its initial value and the sum of `x` plus each element of the list `a` starting from index `n-1` down to `0`, but only if the index `i` is less than `m`. The variable `x` will be the cumulative sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `-1`, `n` will still be at least 1, `pergunta` will be the smallest value between its original value and the sum of `x` and each `a[i]` for `i` from `n-1` to `0` (if `i < m`), and `x` will be the total of `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value between its initial value and the sum of x and each a[i] for i from n-1 to 0)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the case where Kirill needs to move multiple positions at once to reach his desired position within the first `m` people. 

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Kirill needs to move from position 4 to position 2.
  - He can move from position 4 to position 3 for 5 coins, and then from position 3 to position 2 for 3 coins.
  - Total cost: 5 + 3 = 8 coins.

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program calculates the total cost as 14 coins, which is incorrect.

### Issue:
The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for the cumulative cost of moving through intermediate positions. It only considers the cost of moving directly to the target position without considering the intermediate steps.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the program correctly accumulates the costs for each step in the sequence of moves. This requires a more detailed approach to calculate the minimum cost path from Kirill's initial position to any position within the first `m` people.
