Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `ans_list`.
   - The loop variable `a` takes the value of each element in `ans_list`.
   - The loop control variable `a` is not explicitly defined in the given code snippet, but it implicitly refers to the elements of `ans_list`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `ans_list`.
   - Since `ans_list` must contain at least one element at the end of the previous iteration, the loop can continue if `ans_list` still contains at least one element.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ans_list` must contain at least one element.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ans_list` must still contain at least one element.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `ans_list` must still contain at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ans_list` must contain at least one element**
