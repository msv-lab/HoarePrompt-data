Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (`k - mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k % 2 + k // 2`), `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[r]` is `0` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is `l + 1` if `a[l]` equals 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, and `t` is `k % 2` if `mi * 2 > k`.

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
