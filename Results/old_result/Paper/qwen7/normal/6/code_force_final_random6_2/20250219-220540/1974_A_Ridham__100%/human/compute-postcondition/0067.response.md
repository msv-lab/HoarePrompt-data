Based on the initial state provided, the `result` list will contain the values calculated for each iteration of the loop. Each value in `result` is determined by the logic inside the loop, which involves reading `x` and `y` from input, calculating `screen_require_for_y` and possibly `extra_screen`, and appending the appropriate value to `result`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact values in `result`. However, we know that for each iteration:

- If `space_x` (initially `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` (calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`), `screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`.
- Otherwise, `extra_screen` is calculated and added to `screen_require_for_y`, and the sum is appended to `result`.

The `print` statement outputs each value in `result` on a new line.

Output: **a list of integers, each representing the calculated value for each iteration of the loop, with each value on a new line**
