Reasoning:
The provided function `func()` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene. The points are gained when you place a card on the table that matches a card already on the table.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function reads lines from standard input, but it does not process the actual input data correctly.
   - It splits each line into tokens and calculates the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens.
   - This difference is printed for each test case.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The calculation `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` gives the number of duplicate tokens in the line, which is not relevant to the game logic.
   - The function does not account for the optimal strategy of either player, nor does it simulate the game turns.

4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The function should simulate the game turns, considering the optimal moves of both players.
   - It should keep track of the cards on the table and calculate the maximum points you can achieve.

Given the above analysis, the provided function does not implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
