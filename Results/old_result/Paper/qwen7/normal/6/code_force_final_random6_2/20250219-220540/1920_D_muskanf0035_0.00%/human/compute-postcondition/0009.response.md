Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` is reduced by 1, `q` is an input integer, `operations` is a list of n tuples, each tuple containing two integers.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` lines from the input, each line containing two integers separated by a space. These lines are converted into tuples of integers and collected into a list named `operations`. Each tuple in the list represents the two integers read from each line. The variable `n` is used to determine the number of such lines to read, so after reading these lines, `n` is effectively reduced by 1. The variables `t` and `q` remain unchanged except for their initial conditions.
