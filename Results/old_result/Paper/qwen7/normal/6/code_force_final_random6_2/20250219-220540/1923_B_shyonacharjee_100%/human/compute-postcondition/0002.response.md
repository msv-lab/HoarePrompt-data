Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3 ⋅ 10^4 is not affected by this code and remains unchanged.
