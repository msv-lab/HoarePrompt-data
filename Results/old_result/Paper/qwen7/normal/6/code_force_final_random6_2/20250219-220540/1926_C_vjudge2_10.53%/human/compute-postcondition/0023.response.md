Output State: **`i` is 1; `values` is a list with elements [0, 1, 1]; `total` is 1**

Explanation: The code `sum_values[i] = total` updates the list `values` at index `i` (which is 1) with the value of `total` (which is 1). The initial state of `values` is `[0, 1]`, so after updating the second element (index 1), `values` becomes `[0, 1, 1]`. The values of `i` and `total` remain unchanged.
