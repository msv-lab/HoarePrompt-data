Postcondition: **Output State: `T` is -1, `r` is 0, `k` is 0, `l` is `n - 1`, `mi` is `a[l]` since `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is the total number of operations performed, which could be up to `n // 2` if every pair can be reduced completely, `a[r]` is 0, `t` is `k % 2` which is 0, and `l` is equal to `r` because `l` equals `r` when the condition `l == r` is met.**
