Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `L` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input string, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of the list `N`.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `L`. The other variables (`M`, `N`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
