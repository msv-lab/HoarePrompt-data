Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is `-2 * a[n]`, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` must be equal to `n`, `r` is now `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 4 or 5, `a[r]` is `a[r] - a[l]`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `a[r]` equals 0, then `r` becomes `n - 3` and `sunks` changes to either 4 or 5. If `a[r]` does not equal 0, the values of the variables remain unchanged from the precondition.
