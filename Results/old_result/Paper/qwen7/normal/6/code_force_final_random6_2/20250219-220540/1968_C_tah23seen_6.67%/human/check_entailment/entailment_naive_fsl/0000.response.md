Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not ensure that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  4
  2 4 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  An array `a` such that `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2`, `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4`, and `a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1`. One possible solution could be `a = [3, 5, 4, 9]` as mentioned in the example.

- **Actual Output:**
  Running the provided code with the input will produce an output that does not necessarily satisfy the conditions. For instance, the generated array might not meet the required modular conditions.

To verify, let's manually check the generated array using the provided code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = 2 + 3 = 5`
   - `ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1] = 4 + 5 = 9`

This gives us `ans = [3, 5, 9]`. However, we need to ensure `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1`, but `9 \bmod 5 = 4`, which does not match the requirement.

Thus, the program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
