Output State: The `res` list remains empty, `ul` is incremented by 6 (2 increments per iteration, for 3 iterations), `ur` is `ur + 6`, `i` is 3, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `ul` does not equal `ur`. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point during these iterations, the loop will break.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `res` list is still empty, `ul` has been incremented by 6, `ur` has also increased by 6, `i` is 3, and the loop condition `ul == ur` is checked after each iteration. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point, the loop will stop executing.
