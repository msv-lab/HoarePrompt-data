Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` is empty.
- `rdb` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is 3.
- `sng` must contain at least two elements.
- The value of `k` is such that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

However, there is no explicit definition for `elem` in the initial state. Given the information, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem`. Therefore, the output will simply include `elem` twice, separated by a space, but the actual content of `elem` remains unknown.

Output: **elem elem**
