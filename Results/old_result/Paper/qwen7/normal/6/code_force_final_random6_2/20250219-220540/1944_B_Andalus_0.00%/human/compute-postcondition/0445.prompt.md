Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is 0
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element. If `sz` is 2, then `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 4. If `sz` remains 0, it means the condition `k - sz >= 2` was not met, and thus the value of `sz` stays unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `sz` is either 0 or 2. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is less than 2, the original conditions of `rdb` containing at least one element and `sz` being 2 or 4 still hold, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element, and `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. If `k - sz` is less than 2, the condition inside the if statement is not met, and `sz` remains either 0 or 2. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` becomes either 2 or 4, and `rdb` still contains at least one element with `elem` as the first element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
