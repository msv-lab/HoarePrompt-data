Output State: **`i` is one of the values in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (i - 1)), -1, (1 << i)], `c` is 3, and either `c` is not equal to `n - 1` or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Since `i` was previously one of the values in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], appending \(2^i\) to `ans` results in `ans` becoming [0, 1, -1, \(2^{i-1}\), -1, \(2^i\)]. All other variables remain unchanged.
