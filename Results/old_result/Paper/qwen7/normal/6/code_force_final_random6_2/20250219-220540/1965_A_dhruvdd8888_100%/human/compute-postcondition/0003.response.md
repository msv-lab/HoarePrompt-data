Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers converted from the original set of strings, and '0' is included.**

Explanation: The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` converts each element in the set `nums` to an integer using `map(int, nums)`, then sorts these integers in ascending order and assigns the result back to `nums`. Since '0' was originally added to the set `nums`, it remains in the set after conversion and sorting.
