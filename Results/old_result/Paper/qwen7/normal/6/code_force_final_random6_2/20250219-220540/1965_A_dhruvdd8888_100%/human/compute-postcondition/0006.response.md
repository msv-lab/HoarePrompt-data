Output State: **`ls` is 0, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is 0, the first element of `nums` is decreased by 0.**

Explanation: The code `nums[i] -= ls` subtracts the value of `ls` (which is 0) from the element at index `i` in the list `nums`. Since `ls` is 0, the value of the first element in `nums` remains unchanged. All other variables and the structure of `nums` remain the same as the initial state.
