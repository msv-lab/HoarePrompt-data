### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, it reads the array `arr` and calls the function `func_1(arr)` to determine the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.
3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers `i` and `j` at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then checks if the elements at these pointers are equal. If they are, it moves both pointers inward, checking adjacent elements until it finds a pair of unequal elements.
   - If the entire array is uniform (i.e., `i > j`), it returns 0 because no operations are needed.
   - If there is a segment of unequal elements, it calculates the length of this segment (`j - i + 1`) and returns it as the cost. This logic assumes that setting the entire segment to the value of the first element in the segment would be the most cost-effective operation.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` does not cover all possible scenarios to achieve the minimum cost. Specifically, it only considers one operation where the entire segment between `i` and `j` is set to the value of the first element in the segment. It does not consider other possible operations that might be cheaper, such as setting parts of the segment to different values.

To illustrate why the current implementation is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Example Input:**
```
4
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
1
1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
0
2
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
0
2
0
```

In the first test case, the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The function correctly identifies that the minimum cost is 4 burles by setting the entire segment `[2, 4]` to the value 2.

However, for the third test case, the array is `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`. The function incorrectly returns 2 burles by setting the entire segment `[3, 4]` to the value 1. The correct minimum cost is actually 2 burles by setting the segment `[4, 5]` to the value 2.

The function `func_1` does not explore all possible ways to split the segment and apply operations to minimize the cost. Therefore, the function does not always yield the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not cover all possible scenarios to achieve the minimum cost. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
