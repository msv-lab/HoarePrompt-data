Postcondition: `xor` is equal to the first element of `cur_arr`; `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr` appended to it; `cur_arr` must have a length of at least 1. If `xor` shifted right by `bit` bits and bitwise AND with 1 is not true, then `xor` remains 0; otherwise, `xor` remains unchanged.
