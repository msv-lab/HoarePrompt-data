Output State: **`a` and `b` are both empty lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `None`, `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of list `b` to the variable `y`. Since `b` is initially an empty list, accessing `b[-1]` would raise an `IndexError` if not handled properly. However, given the context and the initial state, we assume that the code might be part of a larger context where such an error is avoided. The other variables remain unchanged.
