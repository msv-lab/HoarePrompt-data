To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `j`. The condition for the loop to continue is `i <= j`.

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is either 0 or 1.
- `j` is either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2.

We need to consider both conditions for `i` and `j`:

1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, the loop continues as long as `0 <= length(arr) - 1`, which is always true since `length(arr) - 1` is a non-negative integer.
2. If `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, the loop continues as long as `1 <= length(arr) - 2`, which is true if `length(arr) >= 3`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i <= j` must hold true. Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

- If `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, the loop will continue as long as `0 <= length(arr) - 1`.
- If `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, the loop will continue as long as `1 <= length(arr) - 2`.

In both cases, the loop can continue as long as the length of `arr` is at least 2 (since `length(arr) - 1` and `length(arr) - 2` must be valid indices).

Therefore, we need to ensure that the length of `arr` is at least 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2, and the length of `arr` must be at least 2**
