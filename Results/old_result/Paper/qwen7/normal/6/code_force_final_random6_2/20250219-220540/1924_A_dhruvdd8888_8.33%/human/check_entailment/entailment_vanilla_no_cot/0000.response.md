Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` does not properly check for all possible subsequences of length `n`. It only checks if a specific sequence of characters forms a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Incorrect handling of subsequences:**
   - The code tries to form a sequence of characters (`ans`) by iterating through `s` and adding characters to `win` if they are in `us`. This approach does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked.
   - Even if `ps >= n`, it doesn't guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.

3. **Incorrect output generation when the answer is "NO":**
   - When the answer is "NO", the program prints a string that is not necessarily a valid subsequence of `s` of length `n`. It simply appends an extra character `'a'` to the end of the sequence, which is not a valid solution.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    all_subsequences = set()
    
    # Generate all possible subsequences of length n
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(i+1, m+1):
            if len(s[i:j]) == n:
                all_subsequences.add(s[i:j])
    
    # Check if all possible subsequences of length n are in s
    if all_subsequence in all_subsequences for all_subsequence in combinations(us, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        # Find a subsequence of length n that is not in s
        for combination in combinations(us, n):
            candidate = ''.join(combination)
            if candidate not in all_subsequences:
                print(candidate)
                break

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This solution generates all possible subsequences of length `n` and checks if they are present in `s`. If not, it finds and prints one such subsequence.
