Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a string, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a string, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`**.

The code `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
