Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i]'` or `['new_segment', 'i']`, `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is non-negative, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, and `i` is `i + 1`; `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `max_segment[0]` by adding `arr[i]` to its current value. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
