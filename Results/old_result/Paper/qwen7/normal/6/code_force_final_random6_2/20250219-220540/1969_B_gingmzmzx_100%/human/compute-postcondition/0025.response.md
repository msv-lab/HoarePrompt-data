Output State: **Postcondition: `s` is an empty list, `ans` is the total number of times 0 appears in the original list `s` minus the number of times 1 appears in the original list `s`, `zeroes` is the total number of times 0 appears in the original list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where the keys are elements from the original list `s` and the values are their respective counts in the original list `s`, and `c` is the last element processed in the loop.**

In this final state, the list `s` has been fully processed, meaning it is now empty. The variable `ans` reflects the net count of zeros relative to ones in the original list `s`. The variable `zeroes` remains the total count of zeros in the original list. The dictionary `cnt` contains the counts of each unique element from the original list `s`. The variable `c` holds the last element that was processed in the loop.
