Postcondition: `s` is 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a non-empty list, and if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then the conditions remain as specified in the if part. If the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` is false, the conditions also remain as specified in the if part since there is no else part changing anything.
