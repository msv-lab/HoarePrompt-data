Reasoning:
1. The main program reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It calls the `func_1` function for both Bodya and Sasha, using their respective starting positions.
3. The `func_1` function correctly simulates the game for one player, calculating the maximum possible score by considering all possible moves based on the permutation and the remaining turns.
4. The logic within `func_1` ensures that the maximum score is calculated by iterating through the permutation and updating the score and position accordingly.
5. The main program compares the scores returned by `func_1` for Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum score for a given starting position. The main program correctly uses this function and handles the comparison between the two players' scores.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
