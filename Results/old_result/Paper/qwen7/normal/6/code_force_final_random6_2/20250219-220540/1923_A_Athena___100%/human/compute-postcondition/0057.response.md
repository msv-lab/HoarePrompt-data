Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is not empty and its last element is removed, `res` is 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was 0, it is now removed. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
