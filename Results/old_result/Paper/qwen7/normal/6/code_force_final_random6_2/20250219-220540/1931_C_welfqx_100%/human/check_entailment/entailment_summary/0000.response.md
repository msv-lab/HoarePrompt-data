Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the longest sequence of identical elements in the array and its reverse. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to make all elements equal using at most one operation. 

Here's why the current solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Operation Identification**: The program identifies the longest sequence of identical elements in both the original and reversed arrays but does not account for the fact that the operation can span any subarray, not just sequences of identical elements.

2. **Misunderstanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal by performing at most one operation. The current logic does not correctly identify the optimal subarray to change.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle edge cases where the optimal solution might involve changing a different subarray than the longest sequence of identical elements.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
