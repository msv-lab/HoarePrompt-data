Postcondition: `fnd` is either incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `tot` is the sum of `D.values()`, `aa[m:]`, and `aa[:n - m]`. `D[out_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, and `C[out_aa]` remain unchanged. `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1 or greater than `D[in_aa]` by 1. `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` + 2, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `C[in_aa]` becomes `D[in_aa]` + 2. Otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.
