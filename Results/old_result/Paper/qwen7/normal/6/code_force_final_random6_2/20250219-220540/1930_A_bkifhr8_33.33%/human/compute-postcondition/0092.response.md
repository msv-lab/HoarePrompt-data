Postcondition: `i` is less than `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the second element of `lst` is removed, and if the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and the value of `ans` reflects the accumulated increase from the minimum values.
