Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `segment` which is iterated over from the `segments_variants` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of `segment`**: Since `segments_variants` contains `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, the loop will start with one of these two segments.

3. **Adjust the necessary states**: We need to ensure that `segments_variants` is not empty so that the loop can execute. Additionally, since `segment` will take on the values from `segments_variants`, we don't need to adjust its initial value directly, but we need to ensure that `segments_variants` contains at least one element.

4. **Other variables**: The other variables like `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, `i`, and `total_max_segment` are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `segments_variants` to ensure it contains at least one segment.

**State:**
**`segments_variants` must contain at least one segment**
