Postcondition: `counter` is 2 if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0' and `num[i]` also equals '0'. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0' and `num[i]` does not equal '0', or `counter` remains 0 if `num[len(num) - 1]` does not equal '0'. In either case, `i` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
