Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n` and `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2 each time.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1000.
   - `i` is 1.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2 each time, the next value of `i` will be `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be 3) must still be less than `n`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1000, this condition will be satisfied.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1000; `i` is 3**
