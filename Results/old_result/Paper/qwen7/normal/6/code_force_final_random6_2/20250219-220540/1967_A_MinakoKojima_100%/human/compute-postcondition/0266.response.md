Based on the initial state provided, `ans_list` must contain at least one element. However, the specific value of `a` is not explicitly mentioned. Since `a` is not defined in the initial state and there's no additional context to determine its value, we can only state that `a` is an element from `ans_list`.

Output: **a (where a is an element from ans_list)**
