Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to 2.
2. `b` is a list that must have at least 2 elements. Since the exact elements are not specified, we can only refer to them generically as `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and potentially more elements if the list has more than 2 elements.
3. The `print` statement accesses `b[i]`, which means it accesses `b[2]` because `i` is 2.
4. Since `b` has at least 2 elements, `b[2]` exists, but its value is not specified in the initial state.

Given this information, the output will be the value of `b[2]`.

Output: **b[2]**
