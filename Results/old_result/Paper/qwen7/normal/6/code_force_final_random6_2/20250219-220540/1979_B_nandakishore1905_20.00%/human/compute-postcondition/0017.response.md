Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the length of the binary string representation of `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) to the variable `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
