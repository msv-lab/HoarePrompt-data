Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` added to its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `ans`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the code, we assume it breaks out of an implied loop or condition. The value of `ans` remains as the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` added to its previous value.
