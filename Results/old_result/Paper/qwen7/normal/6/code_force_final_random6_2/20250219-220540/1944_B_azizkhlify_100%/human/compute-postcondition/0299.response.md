Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `ul` is `ul` plus 2**.

Explanation: The code `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. The value of `i` is also incremented by 1. All other conditions and the initial states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is incremented by 1 and `ul` is `ul` plus 2.
