### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually using a loop. This part is correct.

2. **Array Check**:
   - The `func_1` function checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same) by iterating through the array once. If it is, it prints `-1`. However, there is a critical flaw in this logic. The current implementation only checks if any two adjacent elements are different, which is not sufficient to determine if the array is already uniform. It should check if all elements in the array are the same.

3. **Counting Operations**:
   - The function iterates through the array to count the maximum number of consecutive identical elements. This part is correct and is used to determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the "beautiful" property.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already uniform, it correctly outputs `-1`. However, the check for uniformity is flawed as explained above.
   - For other cases, it calculates the minimum number of removals needed to ensure the array is no longer "beautiful". This is done by finding the longest sequence of identical elements and subtracting this length from the total array length minus one (since removing one element can potentially break the "beautiful" property). This logic is correct.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly outputs the minimum number of elements to remove or `-1` if it's impossible to break the "beautiful" property. However, due to the flaw in the uniformity check, the function might incorrectly output `-1` for arrays that are not uniform but still cannot be made non-beautiful by removing a single element.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is partially correct but contains a significant flaw in the uniformity check. The program will incorrectly output `-1` for some test cases where the array is not uniform but still cannot be made non-beautiful by removing a single element.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
