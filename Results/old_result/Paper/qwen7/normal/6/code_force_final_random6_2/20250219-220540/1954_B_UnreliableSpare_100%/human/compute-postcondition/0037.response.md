Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0, which resets the counter. Since the initial state of `cnt` was either incremented by 1 if the value at index `i` in `arr` equals `val`, or reset to 0 if it does not, and now `cnt` is explicitly set to 0, `cnt` is now 0. The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 0, so `ans` remains the minimum of `ans` and 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
