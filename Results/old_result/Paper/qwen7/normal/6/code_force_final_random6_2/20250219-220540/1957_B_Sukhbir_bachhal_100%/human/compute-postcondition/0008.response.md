Output State: **`position` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is `position` right-shifted by 1 bit (which is 1), and `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\)**.

Explanation: The code `n >>= 1` performs a right shift operation on `n` by 1 bit. Given that `n` was initially `position` right-shifted by 1 bit (which is 2 right-shifted by 1 bit, resulting in 1), after the operation, `n` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
