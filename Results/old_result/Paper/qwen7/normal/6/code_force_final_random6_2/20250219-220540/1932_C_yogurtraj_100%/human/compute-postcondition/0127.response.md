Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is 2, `y[i]` is `k * a[q2] % m`, `q1` is 1, `q2` is 2**

Explanation: The code `q2 += 1` increments the value of `q2` by 1. Given that `q2` was initially 1, after executing this line, `q2` becomes 2. The values of `i`, `n`, `y[i]`, `q1`, and the expression for `y[i]` remain unchanged.
