Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length` and must be greater than 0, `score` is `score + (a[current_pos - 1])`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`**.

This means that the `current_pos` variable is reassigned to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
