You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, operations is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains two integers b and x such that b ∈ {1, 2}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and queries is a list of q integers k_i such that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after performing all operations.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is decremented to 0 after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` is the final integer input for the number of operations read from the last iteration, `q` is the final integer input for the number of queries read from the last iteration, `queries` is a list of integers obtained from the last input split and converted to integers, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers `b` and `x` such that `b ∈ {1, 2}` and `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` after the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` will be 0 (since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0). The final values of `n` and `q` will be those provided by the last set of inputs. The `queries` list will contain the integers provided as part of the last set of inputs, and `operations` will contain the list of operations read from the last iteration. The `result` will be the output of the function `func_1` applied to the final `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two lists: operations and queries. It performs a series of operations defined in the operations list on an initial array, and then answers a series of queries defined in the queries list. Each operation is represented by a list containing two integers (b, x) where b indicates the type of operation (1 or 2), and x is an integer value. The function updates an array based on these operations and returns answers to the queries, which are integers k_i indicating positions in the updated array.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
