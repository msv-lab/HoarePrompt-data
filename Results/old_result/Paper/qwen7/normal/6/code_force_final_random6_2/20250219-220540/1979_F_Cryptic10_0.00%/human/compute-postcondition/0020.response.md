Output State: **`v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0 and `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`, `d` is `n-2`.**

Explanation: The code removes the value of `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `d` is still `n-2`, and `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`.
