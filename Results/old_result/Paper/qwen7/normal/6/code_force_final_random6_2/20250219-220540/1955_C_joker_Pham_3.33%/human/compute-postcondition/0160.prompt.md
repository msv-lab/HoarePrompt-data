Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9, where the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and if `a[r] < a[l]`, then `a[r]` is adjusted such that it is less than twice the current value of `a[l]` by the amount of `a[r]` if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] \times 2`. Otherwise, `sunks` is set to 1 and `a[r]` is set to \((k + 1) / 2\) if `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, and `l` is updated to `r` + 1, `r` is set to `n - 2`, and `sunks` is set to either 2, 3, or 4. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, then `sunks` remains either 0, 1, or 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2]\) or \(-2 * a[n]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, or 7. If `a[r] * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]` and `sunks` becomes 6 or 7. If `a[r] * 2 - 1` is equal to `k`, then `sunks` is 4. Otherwise, `sunks` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2] - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]\) or \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `n - 3` or `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 4` or `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then no changes occur. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k == a[r] * 2 - 1`, then `sunks` is updated to one of 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k < a[r] * 2 - 1` or `k == 0`, then no changes are made to `sunks` and `a` due to the `break` statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
