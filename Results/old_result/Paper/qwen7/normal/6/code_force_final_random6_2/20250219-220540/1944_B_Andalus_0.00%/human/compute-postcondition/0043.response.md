Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` statement are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 2
   - `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[1]`

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is 2.
   - Since `i < n` (1 < 2), the loop can continue.

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged, so it stays 2.
   - `rdb` does not change within the loop, so it still contains the value of `rgt[1]`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` is still 2.
   - `rdb` is still a list containing the value of `rgt[1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 2, and `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[1]`**.
