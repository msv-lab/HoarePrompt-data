Output State: **`a` is now a list containing the element `lit[i]` appended to its previous elements, `b` remains unchanged, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) + 4`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is not modified by the code, so it remains as `len(b) + 4`. The other variables (`cp`, `n`, `s`, `lit`, `x`, and `y`) are also unaffected by the code.
