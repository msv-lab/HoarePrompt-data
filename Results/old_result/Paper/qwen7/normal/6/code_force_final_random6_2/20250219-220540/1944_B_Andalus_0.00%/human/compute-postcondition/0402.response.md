Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the `for` loop that iterates over the elements of `sng`. The key variables here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `sng` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 1.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, the variable `elem` would have been set to the current element being processed in the loop.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one element.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `sz` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `elem` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, but it is implicitly set to the current element of `sng`.
   - `sng` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `sng` still contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 1, `sng` must contain at least one element**
