    #State: Output State: `segments_variants` is a list containing all the segments that meet the criteria defined in the loop. Each segment in `segments_variants` is a list where the first element is the sum of the segment and the second element is the end index of the segment. `new_segment` is an empty list because it gets reset whenever a new maximum segment is found. `max_segment` contains the sum and end index of the current maximum segment found throughout the array. `max_sum` remains -1 because it is not used or updated within the loop. The value of `arr` remains unchanged as no modifications are made to it within the loop. `i` will be equal to the length of `arr` after the loop completes.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `segments_variants` will contain all the segments from the array `arr` where the sum of the segment elements is maximized compared to previously found segments, and `new_segment` and `max_segment` will reflect the current best segment found during the iteration of the array.

    #State: Output State: `total_max_segment` now contains the segment with the highest first element from `segments_variants` where the length of the segment is not 1. All other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their final states after the third iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `total_max_segment` will hold the segment from `segments_variants` that has the largest first element, provided that the segment's length is greater than 1. The other variables will retain their values from after the third iteration of the loop.

    #`total_max_segment` contains the segment from `segments_variants` that has the largest first element and a length greater than 1, while `segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `i` retain their values from after the third iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the segment from `segments_variants` that has the largest first element (sum of segment elements) and a length greater than 1. During its execution, it identifies and stores all segments that meet certain criteria, updates the maximum segment found so far, and finally selects the segment with the highest sum from these candidates. The function does not modify the input list `arr`. Variables such as `segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and the loop index `i` retain their values from after the third iteration of the loop.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer representing the sum of the original array, and quantity is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations (k).
def func_3(number, quantity):
    answer = 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `number` representing the sum of the original array and a non-negative integer `quantity` representing the number of operations. It processes `number` based on `quantity` and sets the variable `answer` to 0, but does not explicitly return a value.
