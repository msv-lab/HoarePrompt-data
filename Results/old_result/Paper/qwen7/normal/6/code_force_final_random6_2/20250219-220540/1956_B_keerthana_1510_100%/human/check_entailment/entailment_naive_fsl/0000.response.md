Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program reads from standard input and processes lines, but it does not account for the distribution of cards or the optimal strategy for scoring points. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the number of unique tokens in a line and subtracts this from the total number of tokens, which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements. 

To solve the problem correctly, the program needs to:
1. Understand the distribution of cards in the player's hand.
2. Simulate the game turns, considering Nene's optimal strategy to minimize the player's score.
3. Calculate the maximum number of points the player can achieve under these conditions.

The given program does not handle any of these aspects, making it incorrect for the given problem description.
