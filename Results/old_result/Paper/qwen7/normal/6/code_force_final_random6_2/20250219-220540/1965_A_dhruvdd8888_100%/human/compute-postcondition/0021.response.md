Output State: **`cw` is `False`, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `nw` is `True`**.

Explanation: The code `cw = not nw` changes the value of `cw` to the negation of `nw`. Since `nw` is `True`, `cw` becomes `False`. The values of `ls`, `nums`, `i`, and `nw` remain unchanged from their initial states.
