Output State: **`a` is an integer value, `t` is `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + t2 // 15`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `b` is an integer value, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t2` is divisible by 15.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` by adding `t2 // 15` to `t`. Since `t2` is divisible by 15, `t2 // 15` is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
