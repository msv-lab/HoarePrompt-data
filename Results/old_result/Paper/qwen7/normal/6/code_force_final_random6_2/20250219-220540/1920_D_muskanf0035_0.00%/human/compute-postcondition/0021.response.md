Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two lists: operations and queries. It performs a series of operations defined in the operations list on an initial array, and then answers a series of queries defined in the queries list. Each operation is represented by a list containing two integers (b, x) where b indicates the type of operation (1 or 2), and x is an integer value. The function updates an array based on these operations and returns answers to the queries, which are integers k_i indicating positions in the updated array.**

Note: The actual implementation details of how the operations are performed and how the queries are answered are not described here.
