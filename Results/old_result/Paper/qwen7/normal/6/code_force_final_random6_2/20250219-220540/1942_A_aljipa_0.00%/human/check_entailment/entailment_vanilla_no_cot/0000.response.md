Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly address the problem requirements. Let's break down why:

1. **Case Analysis:**
   - When `k == n`, the solution initializes `res` with `[1] * n`. This will result in all cyclic shifts being sorted, which is correct.
   - When `k == 1`, the solution uses `range(n)`, which will generate an array where the first element is less than the second, but subsequent elements can be arranged in a way that only one cyclic shift is sorted. However, this approach does not guarantee that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted.
   - When `k != n` and `k != 1`, the solution sets `res` to `[-1]`, which is incorrect because it doesn't provide a valid array for these cases.

2. **Specific Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the test case `3 2`, the solution will set `res` to `[-1]`, which is incorrect. A valid solution could be `[69420, 69, 420]` as shown in the problem statement.

3. **General Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to construct an array where exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts are sorted. This requires a more complex construction strategy rather than a simple initialization.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k == n:
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            res = list(range(1, n + 1))
        else:
            # Construct an array where exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted
            res = []
            for i in range(n):
                if i < k:
                    res.append(1)
                else:
                    res.append(n)
            # Ensure the first k elements are in ascending order
            res[:k] = sorted(res[:k])
        print(*res if len(set(map(tuple, [tuple(res[i:] + res[:i]) for i in range(n)]) & {tuple(sorted(res))})) == k else -1)

func()
```

This solution constructs an array where exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts are sorted by ensuring the first `k` elements are in ascending order and the rest are chosen to meet the requirement.
