Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is 3, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element of `sng`.**

Explanation: The code sets `sz` to 0. However, since the initial state already specified that `sz` is equal to `k + 3` and the loop would increment `sz` by 1 for each of its 3 iterations, `sz` is updated to 3. The values of `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `elem` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment to `sz`.
