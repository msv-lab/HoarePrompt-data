Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. The list length is between 1 and 200,000, and each element in the list is between 1 and the length of the list. The function returns 0 if no valid pair (i, j) satisfying the given conditions exists. If such a pair exists, it returns the length of the subarray from i to j (inclusive). If no such pair is found, it returns -1.**
