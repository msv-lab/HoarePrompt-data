Output State: **`b` must be at least 0, `x` is equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2) + 1, and `suma` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. The initial value of `x` was defined as `(a - (b + 1) * b) // (b + 1)`, but this definition is no longer relevant after the code execution. The new value of `x` is calculated based on the new formula. The conditions and the increment of `suma` remain unchanged.
