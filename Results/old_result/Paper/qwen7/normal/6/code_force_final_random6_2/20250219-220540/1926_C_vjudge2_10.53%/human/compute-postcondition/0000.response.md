Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 is maintained, and the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the given code snippet.
