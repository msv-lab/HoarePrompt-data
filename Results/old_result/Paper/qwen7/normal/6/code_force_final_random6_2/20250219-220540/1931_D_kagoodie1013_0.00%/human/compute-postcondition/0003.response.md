Output State: **`count` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `mod_x_map`. This dictionary does not affect the values of `count`, `test_cases`, or `results`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
