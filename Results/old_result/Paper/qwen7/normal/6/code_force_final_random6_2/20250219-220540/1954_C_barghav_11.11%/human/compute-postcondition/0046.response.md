Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list
- `b` is a list
- Both `a` and `b` must be of the same length
- `i` is 2

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The value of `i` is 2.
2. Since `a` is a list, `a[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `a`.
3. The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function means that no newline character will be added after printing the value, but since we are only asked to determine what is printed, this detail does not affect the content of the output.

However, the initial state does not provide the explicit value of `a[2]`. We know that `a` is a list, but without knowing the contents of the list `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[2]`.

Therefore, the output will be the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

Output: **[a[2]]**
