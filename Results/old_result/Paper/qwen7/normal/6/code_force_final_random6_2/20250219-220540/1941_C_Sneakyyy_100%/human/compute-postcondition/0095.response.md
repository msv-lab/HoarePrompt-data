Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it counts and prints the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' within `s`. The function does not return any value but prints the count for each test case.**
