Output State: **`i` is 31, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], `c` is 32, `ans` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, 33554432, 67108864, 134217728, 268435456, 536870912, 1073741824, 0, 0, 0, 0]**.

Explanation: The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length matches `n`. Here, `n` is the length of `arr`, which is 32. Since the original length of `ans` is 32, no additional zeros are appended. Therefore, the values of `i`, `arr`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The final state includes the appended zeros at the end of the list `ans`.
