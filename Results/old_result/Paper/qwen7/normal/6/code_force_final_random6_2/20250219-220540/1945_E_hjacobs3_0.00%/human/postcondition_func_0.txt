The function accepts a list of integers (`array`) representing a permutation and an integer (`find`) within the range of the list indices. It performs a binary search to locate `find` within `array`. If `find` is found, it returns a list with the index of `find` as both elements. If `find` is not found, it prints `0` and returns a list with the same index as the first element and `-1` as the second element.
