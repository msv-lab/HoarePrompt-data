Given the initial state where `res` must contain at least one element, and the code snippet:

```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

We need to determine the value of `i` that would be printed. However, the initial state does not provide any specific value or definition for `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the provided information, we cannot determine its exact value.

Therefore, the output will be based on the value of `i` as it is currently defined in the program's state, which is unknown from the given information.

Output: **i (where i is the current value of the variable i)**
