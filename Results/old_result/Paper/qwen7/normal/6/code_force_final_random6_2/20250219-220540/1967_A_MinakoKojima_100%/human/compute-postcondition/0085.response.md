Output State: **`i` is n-1, `dif` is a[n] - a[n-1], `k` is 0, `ans` is ans * (n - 1) - n, and `res` is -n.**

Explanation: The line `ans += res` adds the value of `res` to `ans`. Given that `res` is `-n`, `ans` is updated to `ans * (n - 1) - n`. The other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
