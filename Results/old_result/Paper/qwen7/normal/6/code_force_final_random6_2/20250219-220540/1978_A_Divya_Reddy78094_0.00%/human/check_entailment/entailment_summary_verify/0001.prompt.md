You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3

    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t (number of test cases) and for each test case, an integer n (number of books) and a list of n integers representing the number of pages in each book. The function sorts the list of pages in descending order for each test case and prints the sum of the pages of the two books with the most pages. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the sum of the pages for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the pages of each book stored in `nums`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of book pages in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`.

3. **Pile Division and Reading**:
   - After sorting, the program takes the first two largest numbers from the sorted list (`nums[0]` and `nums[1]`).
   - It prints the sum of these two numbers, which represents the maximum number of pages Alice can read by putting the two largest books in different piles.

### Problem Description Analysis

- The goal is to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the largest book from each pile.
- The optimal strategy is to place the two largest books in different piles because this ensures that the sum of the largest books from each pile is maximized.

### Verification

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum number of pages Alice can read. Here’s why:

- Sorting the list in descending order ensures that the two largest books are at the beginning of the list.
- Taking the sum of the first two elements after sorting guarantees that we are considering the two largest books, which are placed in different piles.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is correct.
