Output State: **`h` is an integer converted from the first part of the input split by ':', `m` is an integer converted from the second part of the input split by ':', and `day` is 'PM'.**

Explanation: The code simply changes the value of the variable `day` from 'AM' to 'PM'. The values of `h` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
