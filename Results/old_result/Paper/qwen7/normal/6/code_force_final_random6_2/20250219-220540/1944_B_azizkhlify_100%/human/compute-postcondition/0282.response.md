Output State: **`i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 6, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `2 * n - 1`, `n` must still be greater than 6, and the element in list `r` at the index `a[i] - 1` will have been incremented by 1 during the last iteration of the loop.
