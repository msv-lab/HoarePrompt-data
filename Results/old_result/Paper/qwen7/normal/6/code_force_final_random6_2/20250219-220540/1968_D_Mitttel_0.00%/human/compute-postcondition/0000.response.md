Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation, and `a` is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function `input = sys.stdin.read` is assigned to the variable `input`.**

This line of code simply reassigns the built-in function `input` to `sys.stdin.read`, which changes how input is read from the standard input. However, it does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
