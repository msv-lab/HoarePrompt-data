Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the string input by the user, and the values of these variables remain unchanged unless `n` equals 2. If `n` does not equal 2, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, or if `count_1` is even and the string `s` contains exactly one instance of '11', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is updated to the string input by the user, and `n` is updated to the integer input by the user. All other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition regarding `count_1` and its impact on the postcondition is also maintained as per the given logic.
