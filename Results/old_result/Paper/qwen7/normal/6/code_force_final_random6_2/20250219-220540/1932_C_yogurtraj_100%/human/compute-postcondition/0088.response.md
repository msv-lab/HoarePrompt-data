Output State: **`i` is either `n - 4` or `n - 5`, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is `q1 - 1`**

Explanation: The code `q1 -= 1` decrements the value of `q1` by 1. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still either `n - 4` or `n - 5`, and `k` is still `k * a[q1] % m`. After executing the code, `q1` is updated to `q1 - 1`.
