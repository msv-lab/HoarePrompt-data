Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `maxi = 0` initializes the variable `maxi` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, or `c`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
