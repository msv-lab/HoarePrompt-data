Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `k`**: According to the given information, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, and `k0` is equal to `k`. This means `k` is initially set to the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be non-zero (i.e., `k > 0`).

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
- `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`.
- `k0` is equal to `k`.
- `arr` is an empty list.

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time is `k`. Since `k` must be non-zero for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list.**
