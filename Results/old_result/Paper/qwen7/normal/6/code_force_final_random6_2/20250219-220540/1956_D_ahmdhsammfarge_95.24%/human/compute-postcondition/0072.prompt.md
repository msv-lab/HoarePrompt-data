You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers, and len(lst) is an integer such that 1 <= len(lst) <= 18.
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                r, l = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
        
    #State: Output State: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` and `r` are the indices `[i, j]` that produce the maximum value of `sm`, which is the sum of all elements in `lst` before index `i` and after index `j`, plus the square of the distance between `j` and `i`. `over_sum` holds this maximum value of `sm`, and the loop has executed all its iterations.
    #
    #In more detail, after all iterations of the loop, `l` and `r` will be the pair of indices that maximize the expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j+1:]) + (j - i + 1)**2`. The variable `over_sum` will store the value of this expression for the optimal pair of indices. The values of `i` and `j` will no longer be used and can be considered as undefined after the loop completes.
    return r, l
    #The program returns the indices `r` and `l` which produce the maximum value of `sm`, where `sm` is defined as the sum of all elements in `lst` before index `l` and after index `r`, plus the square of the distance between `r` and `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and returns two indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`, where `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` before index `l` and after index `r`, plus the square of the distance between `r` and `l`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the indices `r` and `l` which produce the maximum value of `sm`, where `sm` is defined as the sum of all elements in `lst` before index `l` and after index `r`, plus the square of the distance between `r` and `l`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
