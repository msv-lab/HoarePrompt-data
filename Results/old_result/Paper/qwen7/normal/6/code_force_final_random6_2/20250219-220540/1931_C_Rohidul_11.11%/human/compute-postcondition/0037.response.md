Postcondition: `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is 3, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If the condition `st == 0 and end == 0 and (a[0] != a[-1])` is true, then `ans` is set to `len(a) - 1`. However, since the else part is executed in all other cases, `ans` is set to 0, `l` remains equal to `r`, `st` retains its original value, `end` is set to 3, and `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.
