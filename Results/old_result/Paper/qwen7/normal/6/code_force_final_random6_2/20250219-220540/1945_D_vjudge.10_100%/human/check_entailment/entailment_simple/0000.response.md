Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly defines the function `func_1` which processes the input data and calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.
2. The function initializes `x` to 0 and iterates backward through the list `a` from `n-1` to `0`.
3. For each iteration, it checks if the current index `i` is less than `m`. If true, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
4. It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.
5. After the loop completes, `pergunta` holds the minimum number of coins required for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
6. The function prints the value of `pergunta`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code based on the provided annotations and the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
