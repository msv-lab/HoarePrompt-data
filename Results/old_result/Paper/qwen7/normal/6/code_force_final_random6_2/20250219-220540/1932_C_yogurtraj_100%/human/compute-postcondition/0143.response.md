Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i = -1`
   - `n = 2`
   - `q1 = 0`
   - `q2 = 1`
   - `y = [k * a[1] % m, k * a[0] % m]`
   - `k = k * a[0] % m`

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is not explicitly defined, but it seems to be a list. Since `y` is defined in terms of `a[0]` and `a[1]`, let's assume `a` is a list with at least two elements.
   - `m` is not explicitly defined, but it is used in the modulo operation.

3. **Evaluating `k`:**
   - The value of `k` is not provided directly, but it is updated as `k = k * a[0] % m`. Without knowing the initial value of `k` or `a[0]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `k`. However, we know that `k` is being updated in this manner.

4. **Evaluating `y`:**
   - `y` is defined as `[k * a[1] % m, k * a[0] % m]`.
   - The first element of `y` is `k * a[1] % m`.
   - The second element of `y` is `k * a[0] % m`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(*y)` will unpack the list `y` and print its elements separated by spaces.

Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **[k * a[1] % m, k * a[0] % m]** (where `k` is the value after the update `k = k * a[0] % m`, and `a` is a list with at least two elements).
