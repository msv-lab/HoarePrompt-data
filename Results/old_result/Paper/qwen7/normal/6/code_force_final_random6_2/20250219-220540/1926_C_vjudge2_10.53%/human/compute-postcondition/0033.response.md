Output State: **`i` is 10; `word` is '10'; `remainder` is 1**

Explanation: The code `remainder = int(word[:-1])` takes the string `word` which is '10', slices it from the beginning to the second last character (`[:-1]`), resulting in '1', and converts it to an integer, so `remainder` is now 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 10, and `word` remains '10'.
