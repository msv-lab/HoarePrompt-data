Output State: **`idx` is increased by 2; `v[x]` is increased by 1; `x` is an integer from `data[idx-1]`**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Since `idx` was initially increased by 1, now it is increased by 2 in total. The value of `v[x]` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The value of `x` is still an integer from `data[idx-1]` because the index `idx` has just been incremented, so `x` is still referencing the same element in the list `data`.
