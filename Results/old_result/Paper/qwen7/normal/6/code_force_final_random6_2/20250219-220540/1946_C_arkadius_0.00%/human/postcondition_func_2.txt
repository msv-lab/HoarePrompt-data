The function `func_3` accepts a tree representation (`tree`), along with integers `n`, `k`, and `x`. It returns `True` if either:

- More than `k` components remain after removing `k` edges, or
- Exactly `k` components remain and each component has at least `x` vertices.

Otherwise, it returns `False`.
