Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is `sz + 2`.

Since `sz` is being incremented by 2, it means `sz` is now at least 3 (assuming it was initially at least 1).

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem` from the given information.

Output: **elem elem ** (where elem is the value of the element being referred to)
