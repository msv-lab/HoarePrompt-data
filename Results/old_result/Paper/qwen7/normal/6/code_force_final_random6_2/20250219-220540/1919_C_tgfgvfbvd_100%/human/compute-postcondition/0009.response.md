Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity, `c` is 0, `x` is 0. After the if-else block executes, `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to positive infinity, regardless of the condition in the if statement.
