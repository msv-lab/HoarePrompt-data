Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, with `c` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` being the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `b` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, representing the total number of iterations the loop will execute.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `results` will contain the return values from calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the `t` iterations. Each call to `func_1` uses `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` which are all stripped of leading and trailing whitespace as per the input provided during each iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is used to determine the number of times the loop will run, which is between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
