Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 0, `r` is 3, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 9, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first one plus 9.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `i` remains 0 because the loop increments `j` from `i+1` to the end of the list, and `i` is never incremented within the loop. The variables `l` and `r` are updated to 0 and 3, respectively, based on the given output state after the third iteration. The variable `over_sum` is updated to include the additional term `(j - i + 1)**2`, which becomes 9 when `j` is 3 and `i` is 0. The other variables (`lst`, `j`, `sm`) remain as described in the final iteration's output state.
