Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `y` is `x - 1`.

The print statement `print(y)` will print the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Output: **x - 1 (where x is an input integer between 1 and 1000)**
