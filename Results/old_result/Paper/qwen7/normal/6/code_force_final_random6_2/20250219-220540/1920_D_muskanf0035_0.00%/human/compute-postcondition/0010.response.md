Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` is reduced by 1, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `queries = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `queries`. The values of `t` and `n` are updated as per their initial conditions (incremented by 1 and reduced by 1 respectively), and `q` remains an input integer. The value of `operations` remains unchanged.
