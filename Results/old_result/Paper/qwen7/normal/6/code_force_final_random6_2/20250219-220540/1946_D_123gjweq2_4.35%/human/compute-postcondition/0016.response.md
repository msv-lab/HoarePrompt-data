Output State: **`new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it, `cur_arr` contains the length reduced by one, `xor` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `xor` to 0. This does not affect the contents of `new_arr` or `cur_arr` directly, but it sets `xor` to 0. The initial state of `new_arr` containing the value of `xor` appended to it remains unchanged because `xor` is now 0. Similarly, `cur_arr` containing the length reduced by one also remains unchanged.
