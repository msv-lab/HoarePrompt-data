Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being `lit[i]`, `i` is 0, `x` is less than `y`, `x` is not equal to `y`, and the current value of `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 0, the last element of `a` after appending will be `lit[0]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
