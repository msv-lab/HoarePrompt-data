Output State: The variable `t` will be set to 0 after all iterations of the loop have finished. The variables `n` and `k` will retain their last assigned values from the input during the last iteration of the loop. No further changes will be made to `n` and `k` once the loop ends.

This is because the loop runs exactly `t` times, where `t` is the initial value read from input. After `t` iterations, `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. Once `t` becomes 0, the loop terminates, and no further assignments or operations are performed on `n`, `k`, or `t`.
