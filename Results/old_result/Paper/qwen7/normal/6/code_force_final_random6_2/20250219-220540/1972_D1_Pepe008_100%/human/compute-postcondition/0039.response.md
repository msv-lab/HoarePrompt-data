Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the variable `b`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 because the range function `range(1, b + 1)` means `i` will start from 1.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `b` is at least 1 and `i` starts from 1.

Given the initial states:
- `b` is 0
- `a` is `int(info[0])`
- `suma` is 0
- `x` is the last computed value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`
- `t` is `T`

We need to adjust the state of `b` to ensure the loop can execute. Since `i` starts from 1, `b` must be at least 1.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `b` must be greater than 0
- `i` is implicitly set to 1 by the loop

So, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
