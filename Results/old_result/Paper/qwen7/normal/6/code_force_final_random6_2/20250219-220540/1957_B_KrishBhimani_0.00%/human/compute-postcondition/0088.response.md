Output State: **`i` is 16, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768], `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` is a list with one element which is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and `c` is increased by 1.**

The value of `c` is incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `arr`, `c` (before increment), `ans`, and `k0` remain unchanged from the initial state.
