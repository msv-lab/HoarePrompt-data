Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and either `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The conditions for updating `ans` and checking if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp` are not specified in the given code snippet, so they remain as described in the initial state. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `tmp`) are not affected by this line of code.
