Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length n.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the string `s` is defined based on the new value of `n`. Therefore, the length of `s` is now `n`, and `n` itself is an integer input within the specified range.
