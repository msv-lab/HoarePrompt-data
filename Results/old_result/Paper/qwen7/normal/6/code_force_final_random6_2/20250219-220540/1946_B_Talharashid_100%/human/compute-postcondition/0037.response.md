Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in l:`. The objects involved here are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `c` is 0.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `int(input())` remains the same.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `l`. For the loop to execute, `l` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `l`, `l` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variables `c`, `maxi`, and `i` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they don't need to be adjusted based on the loop itself.
   - `int(input())` is not part of the loop head either, so it doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `l` having at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` must have at least one element**
