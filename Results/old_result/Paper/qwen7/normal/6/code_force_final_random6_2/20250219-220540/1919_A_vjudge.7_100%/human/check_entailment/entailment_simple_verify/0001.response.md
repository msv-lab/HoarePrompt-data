### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or not swap wallets but must always remove one coin from their own wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to win.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `if a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

3. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - If `a + b` is even, the total number of coins is even.
     - In such a scenario, the player whose turn it is will always be able to force the other player into a position where they have an odd number of coins.
     - This means that the player who starts (Alice) will eventually be forced to have 0 coins in their wallet first, leading to a loss.
   - If `a + b` is odd, the total number of coins is odd.
     - Here, the player whose turn it is will always be able to force the other player into a position where they have an even number of coins.
     - This means that the player who starts (Alice) can always ensure that she does not lose until the very end, allowing her to win.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the given program correctly determines the winner based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - The program matches the optimal strategy analysis provided in the problem description.

However, there is a critical flaw in the program's logic. The program assumes that the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum `a + b` directly determines the winner without considering the actual sequence of moves and the optimal strategy.

Let's consider the following example:
- Suppose Alice has 1 coin (`a = 1`) and Bob has 2 coins (`b = 2`). The sum is 3 (odd), so the program would predict Alice to win. However, let's analyze the game:
  - Alice can swap wallets, giving her 2 coins and Bob 1 coin.
  - Bob then removes a coin, leaving him with 0 coins and Alice with 2 coins.
  - Alice can now remove a coin, leaving her with 1 coin and Bob with 0 coins.
  - Bob cannot make a move since he has 0 coins, so Alice wins.

In this case, despite the sum being odd, Alice can still win because she can force Bob into a losing position.

Therefore, the program's logic is flawed because it does not account for the actual sequence of moves and the optimal strategy. The correct approach should simulate the game to determine the winner based on the optimal moves.
