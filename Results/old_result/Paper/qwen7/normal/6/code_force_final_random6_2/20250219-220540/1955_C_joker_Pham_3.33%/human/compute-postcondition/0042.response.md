Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is either 0 or 1, and the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[l]`, then `k` is reduced by \(2 * a[l]\), `l` is increased by 1, and `sunks` is set to 2. Otherwise, if `k` equals `2 * a[l] - 1`, then `sunks` is set to 1 and the current value of `a[l]` is set to \(\frac{k + 1}{2}\); otherwise, `sunks` remains unchanged.
