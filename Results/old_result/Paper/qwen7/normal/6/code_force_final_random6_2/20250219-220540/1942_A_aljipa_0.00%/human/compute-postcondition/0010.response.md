Output State: **`res` is `[-1]`, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (inclusive) minus 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This changes the values of `n` and `k`, but does not affect the values of `res` and `t`. Since the initial state specified that `res` is `[-1]` unless certain conditions on `k` are met, and `t` remains unchanged, the output state reflects these unaltered conditions along with the new values of `n` and `k`.
