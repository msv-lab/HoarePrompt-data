Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is 2, `y[i]` is `k`, `q1` is 1, `q2` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `y[i] = k` updates the value of `y[i]` to `k`. Given that `i` is -1, `n` is 2, and the postcondition mentions that if `t[i]` is 'R', then `q2` is incremented by 1, otherwise `k` is updated to `k * a[1] % m` and `q1` is set to 1, the value of `q2` remains unchanged because the value of `t[i]` is not provided and thus we cannot determine if the condition for incrementing `q2` is met. The value of `k` is updated to itself (as no new value for `k` is given), and `q1` is set to 1.
