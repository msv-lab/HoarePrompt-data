Output State: **`c` is 2, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`, and `ans` is a list containing the value `1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends `1 << i` (which is `1` since `i` is `0`) to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains the value `-1`. After executing the code, `ans` will contain the value `1`. All other variables (`c` and `i`) remain unchanged. The list `arr` also remains unchanged.
