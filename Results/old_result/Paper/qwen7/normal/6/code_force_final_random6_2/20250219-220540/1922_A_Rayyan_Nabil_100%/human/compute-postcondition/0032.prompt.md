You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, with `c` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` being the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `b` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, representing the total number of iterations the loop will execute.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the 1000 iterations of the loop, `t` is 1000, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration, `result` is the last (1000th) element in the `results` list.
    #
    #In this final state, the `results` list will contain the return values from calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` exactly 1000 times, with `t` set to 1000 indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `c`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state, since these values do not change within the loop. The `result` variable will hold the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` during the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function returns different outputs based on the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
