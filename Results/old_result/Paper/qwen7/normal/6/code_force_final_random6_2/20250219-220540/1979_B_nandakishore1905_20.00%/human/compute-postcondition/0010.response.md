Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is equal to `t`.
- `n` is 0.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \(k = |n - m|\).
- `m` is not divisible by 2.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer 1. Since no other variables or objects are being printed in this statement, the output is solely the integer 1.
