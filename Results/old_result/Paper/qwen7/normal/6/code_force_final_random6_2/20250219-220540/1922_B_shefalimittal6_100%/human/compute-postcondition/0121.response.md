Output State: **`idx` is increased by 2; `v[x]` is increased by 2; `x` is an integer from `data[idx-1]`**

Explanation: The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. Since `v[x]` was previously increased by 1 (as per the initial state), it is now increased by 2. The other variables (`idx` and `x`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
