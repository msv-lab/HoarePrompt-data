Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points you can get by optimally choosing which card to play each turn, considering Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score.
2. **Program Logic**: The given program simply counts the number of duplicate elements in the input list (i.e., the number of tokens minus the number of unique tokens) and prints this count. This approach does not account for the strategic nature of the game or the optimal play of Nene.
3. **Incorrect Output**: The program will produce outputs based on the count of duplicates, which is unrelated to the actual game strategy and scoring mechanism. For example, the sample inputs and outputs provided do not match the expected results based on the program's current logic.

Given these points, the program is not correct for solving the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
