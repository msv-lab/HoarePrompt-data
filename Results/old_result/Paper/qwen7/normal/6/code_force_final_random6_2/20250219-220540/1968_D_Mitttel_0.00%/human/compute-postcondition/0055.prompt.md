Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cycle_pos` is equal to `current_pos`, `cycle_score` is 0, `cycle_start` is the value of `steps` when a cycle is detected, `current_pos` is the position where the cycle starts, `score` is the total sum of elements in the array from the start position to the cycle start position, plus the sum of elements within the cycle multiplied by the number of times the cycle is completed, `n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation and array, `k` is an integer representing the duration of the game, `p` is a list of integers representing the permutation, `a` is a list of integers representing the array; `steps` is equal to `k`, `visited` is a dictionary containing all positions and their corresponding step counts up to the point where the cycle is detected or the loop ends, `cycle_length` is calculated as `steps - cycle_start`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cycle_length):
    cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
    cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cycle_score` is increased by the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]`; `cycle_pos` is updated to the value of `p[cycle_pos - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cycle_score` is increased by the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]`, `cycle_pos` is updated to the value of `p[cycle_pos - 1]`, `cycle_length` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cycle_score` is increased by the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]`, `cycle_pos` is updated to the value of `p[cycle_pos - 1]`, `cycle_length` must be greater than 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
