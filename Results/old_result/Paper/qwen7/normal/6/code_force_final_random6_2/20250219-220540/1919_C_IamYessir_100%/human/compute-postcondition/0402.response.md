Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list with one more element than before and the appended element is `lit[1]`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), and `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to list `b`. Given that `i` is 1, `lit[i]` is `lit[1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, `n` remains greater than 0, and the conditions for lists `a` and `b` and variables `y` and `x` remain as per the initial state, except that `b` now contains one additional element, which is `lit[1]`.
