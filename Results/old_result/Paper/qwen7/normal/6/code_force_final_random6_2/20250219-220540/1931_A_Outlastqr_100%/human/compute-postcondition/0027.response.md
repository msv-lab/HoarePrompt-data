Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an input integer, `word` is either a string containing the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz' if `n` is greater than 52, or 'az' if `n` is greater than 27, 'aay' if `n` is 27, or 'aaa' if `n` is not 27, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `n`. The initial value of `i` was 1, and after executing the line of code, it is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables (`t` and `word`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
