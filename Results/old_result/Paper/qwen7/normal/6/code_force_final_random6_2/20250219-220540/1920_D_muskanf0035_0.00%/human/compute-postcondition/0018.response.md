Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `q` is an input integer.
- `queries` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers obtained from input.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the `result` list, which is the return value of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values in `result`. However, we know that `result` is derived from the function call with inputs `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, operations, queries))**
