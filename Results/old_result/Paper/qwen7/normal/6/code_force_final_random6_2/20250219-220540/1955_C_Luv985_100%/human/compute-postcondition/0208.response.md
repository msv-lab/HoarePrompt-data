Output State: **`T` is -1, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is `k - 2 * min(a[l], a[r])`, `l` is either 1 or 0, `mi` is `min(a[l] - mi, a[r] - mi)`, `ans` is at least 1, `a[r]` is 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`.**

Explanation: 
- `k` is decremented by `2 * mi`. Since `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r] - mi`, `k` becomes `k - 2 * min(a[l], a[r] - mi)`.
- `mi` is updated to be the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r] - mi`. This ensures that `mi` remains the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r] - mi`.
