Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is a positive integer.

3. **Initial state of the variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The loop will execute based on the input value, which is assigned to `i` in the loop. Therefore, the initial value of `i` must be set to the value of `t`.
   - The condition for the loop to execute is that `i` should be a positive integer. Since `t` is already defined as a positive integer within the given range, `i` will be initialized to `t`.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` must be initialized to the value of `t`.
   - `t` remains as a positive integer within the specified range.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is equal to `t`**.
