Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the value of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` added to its previous value, `lst` is [value after removing the second element].**

Explanation: The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst`. Since `1 * 2` equals 2, the element at index 2 is removed. The initial state of `lst` is not explicitly given, but after removing the element at index 2, the list becomes `[value after removing the second element]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
