Output State: **`ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1, `r` is 5, `f` is 0, `onum` is a list which is the reverse of the original `num` list.**

Explanation: The code `ck = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `ck`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ck` and retains the initial states of the other variables.
