Postcondition: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by either 1 (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`) or by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`). The stack must still contain at least one tuple (u, False).**
