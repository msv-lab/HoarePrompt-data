Postcondition: `i` is the first character of the string `s`. If `i` is in the set `us`, then `i` is added to the set `win`, `i` is added to the list `ans`, the set `us` is unchanged, and `ps` is increased by 1. If the length of `win` equals `k`, these operations are performed; otherwise, the set `win` remains unchanged.
