Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in arr`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 16
   - `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be one of the values in the list `arr`. Since `i` is currently 16, it is still within the list `arr`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**: 
   - `i` will be set to the next value in the list `arr`, which is 32.
   - The other variables (`arr`, `c`, `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 32, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`**
