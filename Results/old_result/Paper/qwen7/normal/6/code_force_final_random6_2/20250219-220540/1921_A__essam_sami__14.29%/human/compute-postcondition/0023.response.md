Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `steps` is 1.
- `a` is the first integer from the input split.
- `b` is the second integer from the input split.
- `c` is the first integer entered.
- `d` is the second integer entered.
- `g` is updated to the first integer from the input split converted to an integer.
- `h` is updated to the second integer from the input split converted to an integer.
- `n` is updated to \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).
- `x` is updated to \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).

We need to determine the value of `x`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer.
- `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer.

So, `x` is calculated as:
\[ x = (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2 \]

Given that `c` and `d` are the integers entered, and `g` and `h` are the integers from the input split, the value of `x` will be the squared distance between the point \((c, d)\) and the point \((g, h)\).

Output: **(c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2**
