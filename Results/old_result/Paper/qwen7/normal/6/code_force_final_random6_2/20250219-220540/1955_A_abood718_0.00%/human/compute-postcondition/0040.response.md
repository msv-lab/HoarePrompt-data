Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values for `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion respectively. It calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts considering the promotional price for two yogurts and returns the total cost.**
