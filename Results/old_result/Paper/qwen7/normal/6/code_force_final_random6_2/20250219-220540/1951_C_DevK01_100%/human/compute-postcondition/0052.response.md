Output State: **`n` is one less than the length of `N`, `t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers where `L[0]` is the length of the list `M`, `L[1]` is the minimum value between the input integers, and `L[2]` is the third element of `L`, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from input, `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the smaller value between `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

In this output state, the variable `cost` has been assigned the value `mu * w`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions as described in the initial state.
