Output State: **`i` is 16, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, and `arr` is a list containing the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15; `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans`. No operations are performed on any of the existing variables, so their values remain unchanged. The list `arr` already contains the values from 0 to 15, and `k` is 0, so no further changes occur. The output state includes all the initial conditions and the new state of `ans`.
