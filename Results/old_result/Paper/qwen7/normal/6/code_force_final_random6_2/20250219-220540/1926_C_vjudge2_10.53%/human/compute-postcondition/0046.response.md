Output State: **`i` is 12; `word` is '12'; `last` is 2**

Explanation: The code `last = int(word[len(word) - 1])` extracts the last character of the string `word` (which is '2') and converts it to an integer, assigning the result to the variable `last`. The length of `word` is 2, so `len(word) - 1` is 1, and `word[1]` is '2'. This '2' is then converted to the integer 2 and assigned to `last`. The values of `i` and `word` remain unchanged.
