Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`.
   - `c` is 2.
   - `ans` is a list containing the value `[1]`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, it means that the input was consumed once in the previous iteration, and now `i` is incremented by 1 (though it's not explicitly shown in the loop body, it's implied).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - `c` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but there's no indication of such modification in the given information.
   - `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `[1]`**
