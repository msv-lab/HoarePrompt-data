Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `range(n)` and `n` can be up to 1000), `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split for the last iteration of the loop. The values of `t` and `a`, `b`, `c` remain unchanged throughout the loop executions as no assignment to these variables is done within the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\). For each test case, it determines whether the sequence \(a, b, c\) represents a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\)), or 'NONE' otherwise. It prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final values of \(i\) (which will be 999 since the loop runs from `range(n)` and \(n\) can be up to 1000) and the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the last test case.
