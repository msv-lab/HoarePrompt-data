Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\)), and `a` (a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`). It processes the list `a` by performing operations based on the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` within a while loop. The function counts the number of successful operations (referred to as `sunks`) and returns this count, which can be one of the values 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.**
