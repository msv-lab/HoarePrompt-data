Postcondition: **The `stack` contains a series of tuples `(u, False)` where each `u` is a successive child vertex from `tree.vertices[v].children`. This is true regardless of whether `postorder` is `True` or `False`, as the if part handles the case when `postorder` is `False` by populating the stack with the children of `v` from `tree.vertices[v].children`, each paired with `False`.**
