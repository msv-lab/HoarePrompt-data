Output State: **`ans` is `n`, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n / count` to `g`. Given that `count` is 2, `g` becomes `n / 2`. The other variables (`ans`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g` being adjusted) remain unchanged from their initial states.
