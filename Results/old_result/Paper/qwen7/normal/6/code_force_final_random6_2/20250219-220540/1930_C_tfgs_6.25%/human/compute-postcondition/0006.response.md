Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`
   - `i` is `i + 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Analyze the changes made in the loop body**:
   - `a[i]` is updated by adding `i + 1` to its current value.
   - `i` is incremented by `1`.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus `1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration, if `i` was `i` before the increment, then after the increment, `i` becomes `i + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `i + 1` and `i` must still be less than `n`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` must be less than `n`**.
