Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `cur_arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `xor` is 0.
   - `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
   - `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, with the constraint \(0 \leq \text{bit} < 30\).
   - `thing1` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `cur_arr`. For the loop to execute, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop body is omitted, the only relevant object for the loop to execute is `cur_arr`. We need to ensure that `cur_arr` has at least one element.
   - The other variables (`xor`, `bit`, and `thing1`) do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cur_arr` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur_arr` must contain at least one element**
