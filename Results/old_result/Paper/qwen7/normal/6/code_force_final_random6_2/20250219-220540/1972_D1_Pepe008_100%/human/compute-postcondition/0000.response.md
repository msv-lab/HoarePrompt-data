Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specified that `t` (which is equivalent to `T` in this context) is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the same condition applies to `T` after the code is executed. All other variables remain unchanged.
