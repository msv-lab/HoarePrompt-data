Output State: **`ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `onum`, `cn` is increased by `ck`, `r` is `t`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n`, but does not affect the values of `ii`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, or the list `onum`. Therefore, the values of `ii`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, and the state of the list `onum` remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is an input integer.
