Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `segments_variants` will contain all the segments generated during the loop's execution, and `total_max_segment` will hold the segment with the maximum starting point from all the segments in `segments_variants`.**

Explanation: The loop iteratively updates `total_max_segment` with the segment having the highest starting point found in `segments_variants`. After all iterations, `total_max_segment` will reflect the segment with the largest starting point among all segments processed. The `segments_variants` list will retain all the segments generated throughout the loop's execution.
