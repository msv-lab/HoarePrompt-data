Output State: The final state of the loop after all iterations will have `result` as a list containing the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for each iteration. Specifically, for each pair of inputs `(x, y)` provided during the loop's execution, `screen_require_for_y` is calculated based on whether `y` is even or odd, and `extra_screen` is determined based on the remaining cells after accounting for `space_y`. The `result` list accumulates these values for all iterations.

To break it down further:
- For each iteration, `x` and `y` are read from input.
- `space_x` is set to `x`.
- `space_y` is set to `y * 4`.
- `total_space` is calculated as `space_y + space_x`.
- `screen_require_for_y` is determined based on whether `y` is even or odd.
- `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`.
- Otherwise, `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is calculated as either `extra_space // 15` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` depending on whether `extra_space % 15 == 0` or not. The value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` is then appended to `result`.

After all iterations, `result` will contain the accumulated values from each iteration.
