Output State: The list `a` has had all its leading and trailing zeros removed, and the variable `res` contains the total count of all zeros that were removed from the list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have had all its leading and trailing zeros removed. The variable `res` will contain the total count of all zeros that were removed from the list `a` during the execution of the loop. This is because the loop removes leading and trailing zeros and increments `res` each time a zero is encountered.
