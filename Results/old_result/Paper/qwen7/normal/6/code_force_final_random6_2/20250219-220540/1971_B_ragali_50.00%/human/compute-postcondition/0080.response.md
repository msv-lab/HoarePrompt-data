Postcondition: **The set `a` now contains all unique characters from the string `s`, and the variables `i`, `t`, and `isreverse` remain unchanged; `isreverse` is the reversed version of the string `s`. If `newstr` is different from `s`, the postcondition holds as per the if part. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, the postcondition holds as per the else part.**
