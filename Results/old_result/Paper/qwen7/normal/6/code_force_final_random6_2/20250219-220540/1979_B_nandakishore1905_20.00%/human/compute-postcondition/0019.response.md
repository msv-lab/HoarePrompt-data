Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is equal to `t`, so `i = t`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, so \(k = |n - m|\).
   - `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, so `l = bin(k)[2:]`.
   - `p` is the length of `l`, so `p = len(l)`.
   - `q` is 2, so `q = 2`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(k - q)`.
   - We need to determine the value of `k - q`.

Given that `q` is explicitly defined as 2, we need to find the value of `k`:
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \(k = |n - m|\).

Since `k` can be any non-negative integer (as it is the absolute difference), let's denote the value of `k` as some arbitrary non-negative integer \(x\). Therefore, `k = x`.

Now, substituting the values into the print statement:
- The expression to be evaluated is `k - q`.
- Since `q = 2`, the expression becomes `x - 2`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `k` minus 2.

Output: **k - 2 (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
