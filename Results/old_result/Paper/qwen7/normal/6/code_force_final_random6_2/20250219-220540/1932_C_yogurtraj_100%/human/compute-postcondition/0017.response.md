Postcondition: `ii` is 0, `t` is an input string, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q1` is either `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is either `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L'.
