Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `q` and the iterable `ans`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `m` is set to `m - 1`.
   - `r` is the integer value of the first split element from the result of `func_1()`.split().
   - `c` is the second split element from the result of `func_1()`.split().
   - `temp` is an empty set.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `ans`. For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `ans` having at least one element, we need to ensure `ans` is not empty.
   - The values of `m`, `r`, `c`, and `temp` do not directly affect the loop's execution but might be used within the loop body. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted specifically for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of `ans`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` must contain at least one element**
