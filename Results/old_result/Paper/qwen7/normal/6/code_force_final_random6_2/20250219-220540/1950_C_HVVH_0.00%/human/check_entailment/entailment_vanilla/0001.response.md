### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` initializes the variable `day` to 'AM'.
   - It reads an integer `n` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `n` times, processing each test case.

2. **Time Conversion Logic**:
   - For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute).
   - It converts `h` and `m` to integers.
   
3. **Handling Midnight and Noon**:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM', correctly converting midnight (00:00) to 12:00 AM.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM', correctly converting times like 13:00 to 01:00 PM.
   - If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'AM' if the next iteration would incorrectly set it to 'PM'. This is unnecessary because 12:00 PM is already correctly handled by setting `day` to 'PM' before the subtraction.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - It prints the time in the 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM'. The use of `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` ensures that the hours and minutes are formatted with leading zeros if necessary.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for handling `h == 12` is redundant. Since the condition `h > 12` already covers the conversion from 13 to 01 PM, there's no need to separately handle `h == 12`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion:
The original code works correctly but can be simplified. However, the provided code still meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
