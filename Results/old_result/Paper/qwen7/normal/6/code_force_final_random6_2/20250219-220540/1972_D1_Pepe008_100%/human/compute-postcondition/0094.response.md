Output State: **`b` must be greater than 7, `i` is 6, `x` is 3, `suma` is increased by 7**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. However, since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. But we know that `i` is 6, so we can calculate:

- `i * (i - 1)` becomes `6 * 5` which is `30`.
- `i ** 2` becomes `6 ** 2` which is `36`.

So, the expression simplifies to `(a - 30) // 36 + 1`. Since `a` is not specified, we cannot simplify further, but we know that `x` is updated according to this formula. Given the initial value of `x` is 2, and assuming `a` is such that the division and modulo operations yield an integer, `x` would be updated to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
