Postcondition: `b` must be at least 0, `suma` is increased by 1 if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` is true, and `x` is equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i). If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 <= 0`, no change is made to `suma`, and the other variables retain their original values as per the precondition.
