Postcondition: `l` must have at least one element. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and `ele`.
