Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\). For each test case, it determines whether the sequence \(a, b, c\) represents a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\)), or 'NONE' otherwise. It prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final values of \(i\) (which will be 999 since the loop runs from `range(n)` and \(n\) can be up to 1000) and the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the last test case.**
