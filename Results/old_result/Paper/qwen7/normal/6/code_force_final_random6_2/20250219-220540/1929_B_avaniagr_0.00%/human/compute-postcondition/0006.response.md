Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `s` since it is the variable being iterated over in the loop.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each line from the standard input (file opened with `open(0)`), starting from the second line (`[*open(0)][1:]`). This means the loop continues as long as there are lines available in the input.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is the next line from the input.
   - `n` is an integer from the first part of `s`.
   - `k` is an integer from the second part of `s`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each line of input, the next value of `s` will be the next line from the input.
   - The values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the new line `s`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The state at the start of the next iteration will be that `s` is the next line from the input, and `n` and `k` will be the integers extracted from this new line.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is the next line from the input, `n` is an integer from the first part of `s`, `k` is an integer from the second part of `s`**.
