Output State: **`ii` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, and `t` is the same as before.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`ii`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
