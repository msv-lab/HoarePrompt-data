Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\)
   - The condition `v[v[i]] != i` holds true (since it was given that `v[v[i]]` equals `i` at the end of the previous iteration, but now it does not hold anymore)

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`
   - `n`

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `n`.

5. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is currently 2.

6. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.

7. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Given that `i` will be 3, the condition `3 <= n` must hold true.

8. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains the same since it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\) and \(3 \leq n\)**
