Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `range(n)` and `n` can be up to 1000), `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split for the last iteration of the loop. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged throughout the loop executions unless the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b and b > c` are met during any iteration, in which case 'STAIR' or 'PEAK' would be printed respectively, but the values themselves do not change due to these prints; they are simply output based on the conditions evaluated.
