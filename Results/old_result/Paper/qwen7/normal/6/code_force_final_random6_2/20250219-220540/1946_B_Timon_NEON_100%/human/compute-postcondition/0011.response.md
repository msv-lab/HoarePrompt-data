Output State: **`segments_variants` is now ['new_segment', 'i - 1'], `new_segment` remains unchanged, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1, `arr` remains unchanged, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0, and max_segment[0] is less than or equal to new_segment[0].**

Explanation: The code appends the list `new_segment` concatenated with `[i - 1]` to `segments_variants`. This means that `segments_variants` now contains the updated list. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
