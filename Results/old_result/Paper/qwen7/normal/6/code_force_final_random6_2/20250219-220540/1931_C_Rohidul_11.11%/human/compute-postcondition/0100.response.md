Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `r` and `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `l` is `n - 1`
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `st` is `n - 3`

4. **Determine the Initial Values for `l` and `r`**:
   - Since `l` and `r` are both `n - 1`, the condition `r > l` is initially false because `r` is not strictly greater than `l`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute based on the current values.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - To make the loop execute at least once, we need to ensure that `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` are true when the loop starts.
   - Since `l` and `r` are both `n - 1`, we need to decrease `r` by 1 to make `r` equal to `n - 2`. This will make `r > l` true if `l` remains `n - 1`.
   - We also need to ensure that `a[n - 2] == a[n - 3]` to satisfy the condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

6. **Final State Before the Loop**:
   - `l` remains `n - 1`
   - `r` becomes `n - 2`
   - `st` remains `n - 3`

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to:

State: **`l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is `n - 3`**
