Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being `lit[i]`, `i` is 4, `x` is either `a[-1]` (which is `lit[i]`), and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` (depending on whether `b` is empty or not). If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `lit[i]` becomes the last element of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `cp`, `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
