Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a deque of n integers such that 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `nums`. Therefore, the initial conditions for these variables remain unchanged, and only `ans` is updated to 0.
