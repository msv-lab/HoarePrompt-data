Output State: **`operations` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x such that b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `n` is the integer input for the number of operations, `q` is the integer input for the number of queries.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` lines of input, where each line contains two space-separated integers `b` and `x`. These inputs are then converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())` and stored in the list `operations`. The values of `n` and `q` are updated to the integer inputs received from the user, but since no operations or queries have been performed yet, the value of `q` remains unchanged. The initial values of `n` and `q` are updated to their respective input values, and the structure of `operations` is defined as specified.
