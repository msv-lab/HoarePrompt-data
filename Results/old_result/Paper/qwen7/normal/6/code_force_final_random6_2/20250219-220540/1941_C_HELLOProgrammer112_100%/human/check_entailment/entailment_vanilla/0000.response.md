Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" using the `count` method.
   - It also counts the occurrences of the substring "mapie".

3. **Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the result using the formula `x + y - z`, where:
     - `x` is the count of "map".
     - `y` is the count of "pie".
     - `z` is the count of "mapie".

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated value for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Substrings "map" and "pie":**
   - Counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" separately is necessary because these substrings might overlap with each other or with "mapie".

2. **Substrings "mapie":**
   - Counting "mapie" helps in avoiding double-counting of overlapping parts. For example, in the string "mapie", both "map" and "pie" are present, but counting them separately would lead to double-counting. By subtracting the count of "mapie", we ensure that overlapping parts are counted only once.

3. **Formula `x + y - z`:**
   - This formula correctly accounts for the minimum deletions required to remove all instances of "map" and "pie". Each occurrence of "mapie" is counted twice (once in "map" and once in "pie"), so subtracting `z` ensures that each instance of "mapie" is only counted once.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:** "mmapnapie"
  - "map" occurs 1 time.
  - "pie" occurs 1 time.
  - "mapie" occurs 1 time.
  - Result: `1 + 1 - 1 = 1` (but the expected answer is 2, which means the formula needs adjustment)

- **Test Case 2:** "azabazapi"
  - "map" occurs 0 times.
  - "pie" occurs 0 times.
  - "mapie" occurs 0 times.
  - Result: `0 + 0 - 0 = 0` (correct)

- **Test Case 3:** "mappppie"
  - "map" occurs 1 time.
  - "pie" occurs 1 time.
  - "mapie" occurs 0 times.
  - Result: `1 + 1 - 0 = 2` (correct)

- **Test Case 4:** "mapmapmapmapmapmap"
  - "map" occurs 6 times.
  - "pie" occurs 0 times.
  - "mapie" occurs 0 times.
  - Result: `6 + 0 - 0 = 6` (correct)

- **Test Case 5:** "p"
  - "map" occurs 0 times.
  - "pie" occurs 0 times.
  - "mapie" occurs 0 times.
  - Result: `0 + 0 - 0 = 0` (correct)

- **Test Case 6:** "pppiepieeee"
  - "map" occurs 0 times.
  - "pie" occurs 2 times.
  - "mapie" occurs 0 times.
  - Result: `0 + 2 - 0 = 2` (correct)

### Conclusion:

The formula `x + y - z` is correct for calculating the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. However, the example "mmapnapie" shows that the current implementation might not handle all edge cases correctly. The correct approach should involve more sophisticated logic to handle overlapping substrings properly.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
