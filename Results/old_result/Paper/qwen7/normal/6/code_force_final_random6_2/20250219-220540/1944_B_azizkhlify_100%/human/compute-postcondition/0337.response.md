Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`i < n`) still needs to be satisfied. Since `n` must be greater than 0, it remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The other variables (`a`, `l`, `res`, `k`, and `re`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the loop execution alone.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
