Output State: **N is an input integer, `vals` is a list of N integers, and `den` is the result of applying `func_1` successively to the elements of `vals` starting with the first element and using each subsequent element as the argument for `func_1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `den` will be the final result obtained by sequentially applying the function `func_1` to each element of the list `vals`, starting with the initial value of `den` and using each list element as the second argument for `func_1`.
