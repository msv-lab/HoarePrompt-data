Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` will be equal to `t-1`, `a` and `b` will be the last two integers entered by the user, `c` and `d` will be the integers entered in the first input, `e` and `f` will be the integers from the second input split, `g` and `h` will be the integers from the last input split. The variable `n` will be the value of \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - b)\) calculated in the last iteration, and `x` will be the value of \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\) calculated in the last iteration. Depending on whether `x` is greater than `n`, either `n` or `x` will be printed in each iteration.**

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop processes each test case sequentially, updating the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` with new inputs for each iteration. The values of `n` and `x` are recalculated in each iteration based on the most recent inputs, and the maximum value between `n` and `x` is printed for each test case.
