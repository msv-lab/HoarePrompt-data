Output State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` remains unchanged (contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element), `sz` is `3 * 2 = 6`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `sz` is less than `k` and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. After each iteration, `sz` increases by 2. Given that the loop executed 3 times, `sz` becomes 6. Since the loop breaks when `k - sz` is no longer greater than or equal to 2, it implies that after 3 iterations, `sz` equals `k`, and the loop terminates. Therefore, once `sz` reaches 6, the condition `k - sz >= 2` is no longer met, causing the loop to break. At this point, `ldb` would be exhausted of its elements since it contained at least one element for each of the 3 iterations. Thus, `ldb` becomes empty. The state of `rdb` and `sz` is as described.
