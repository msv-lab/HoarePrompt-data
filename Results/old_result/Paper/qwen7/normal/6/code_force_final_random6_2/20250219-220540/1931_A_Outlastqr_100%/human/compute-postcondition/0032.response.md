Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an input integer, `word` is a string containing the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 3` followed by 'aa', `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` appends the string `'aa'` and the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 3` to the existing value of `word`. The initial value of `word` is an empty string, so after executing the code, `word` will be updated to include `'aa'` followed by the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 3`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
