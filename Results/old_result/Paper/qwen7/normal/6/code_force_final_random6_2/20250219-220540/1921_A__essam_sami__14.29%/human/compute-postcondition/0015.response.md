Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for steps in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `steps` and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `steps` is currently 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `steps < t`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `steps` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `steps` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range and is determined before the loop starts.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `steps` is now 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, `n` is `(a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)`, `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`**.
