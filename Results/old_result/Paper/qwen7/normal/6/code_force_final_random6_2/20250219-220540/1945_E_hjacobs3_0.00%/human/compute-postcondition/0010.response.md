Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while l <= r`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `l` and `r`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `l <= r`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `mid` is `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`.

4. **Loop Body Adjustments**:
   - If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `l` is set to 0 and `r` is set to `mid - 1`.
   - If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1` and `r` is set to `n - 1`.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `l <= r` must still hold true.
   - We need to consider both possible adjustments from the loop body.

6. **Analyzing Both Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`**:
     - `l` becomes 0.
     - `r` becomes `mid - 1`.
     - To ensure `l <= r` still holds, `mid - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0. Since `mid` is initially `(n - 1) // 2`, `mid - 1` would be valid as long as `mid > 0`.
   - **Case 2: `array[mid]` is less than `find`**:
     - `l` becomes `mid + 1`.
     - `r` remains `n - 1`.
     - To ensure `l <= r` still holds, `mid + 1` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `mid` is initially `(n - 1) // 2`, `mid + 1` would be valid as long as `mid < n - 1`.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - In both cases, the loop can continue as long as `mid` is within the valid range of indices for the array.

8. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - Since `l` and `r` can be adjusted based on the conditions, we need to ensure that the loop can continue with the current values of `l` and `r`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `l` and `r`.

**State:**
State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**
