Output State: **`q` is `x`, the value of `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains elements `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, and `(q + r) % n`, `ans` must contain at least one element**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `q` is initially `x`, the new value added to `temp` is `(x + r) % n`. The other variables (`c`, `temp`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
