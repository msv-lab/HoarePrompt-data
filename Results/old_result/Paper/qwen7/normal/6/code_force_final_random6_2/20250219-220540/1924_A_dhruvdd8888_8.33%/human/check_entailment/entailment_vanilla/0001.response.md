Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the main loop. This suggests a potential issue because the function should handle the logic for each test case.
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

3. **Logic Inside `func_1()`:**
   - The function initializes sets `us` and `win` to keep track of used characters and a window of characters.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if the current character is in `us`. If so, it adds the character to `win`.
   - When `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the character to `ans` and resets `win`.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `ps` (the count of characters added to `ans`) is at least `n`.
   - If `ps` is at least `n`, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a counterexample string by appending one missing character from `us` to `ans` followed by `a` repeated enough times to make the string of length `n`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Function Call Issue:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the main loop. This means the logic inside `func_1()` will not be executed for any test cases.
   - The main loop should call `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Logic for Constructing Counterexample:**
   - The logic for constructing a counterexample string is flawed. It constructs a string by appending one missing character from `us` to `ans` followed by `a` repeated enough times. However, this approach might not always produce a valid counterexample string of length `n`.

### Corrected Program:
To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the function `func_1()` is called correctly and the logic for constructing a counterexample string is improved.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        # Construct a counterexample string
        missing_chars = [c for c in us if c not in win]
        if missing_chars:
            ans.append(missing_chars[0])
            while len(ans) < n:
                ans.append('a')
            print(''.join(ans))
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical issues due to the unexecuted function `func_1()` and flawed logic for constructing a counterexample string. After fixing these issues, the program should work correctly according to the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
