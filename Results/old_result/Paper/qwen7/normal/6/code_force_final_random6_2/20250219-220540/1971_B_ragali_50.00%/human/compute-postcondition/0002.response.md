Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1, `s` is a string without leading or trailing spaces.**

Explanation: The code `s = input().strip(' ')` reads a string from the user input and strips any leading or trailing spaces. However, since no specific value is provided for the input, the only thing we can definitively say is that `s` is a string without any leading or trailing spaces. The conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
