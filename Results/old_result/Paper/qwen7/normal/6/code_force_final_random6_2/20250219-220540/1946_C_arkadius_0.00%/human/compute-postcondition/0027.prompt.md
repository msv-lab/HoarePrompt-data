You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of a Tree class representing the given tree structure, n is the number of vertices in the tree, and k is the number of edges to be removed such that 1 ≤ k < n.
def func_4(tree, n, k):
    beg = 1
    end = n
    while beg < end:
        mid = (beg + end + 1) // 2
        
        if func_3(tree, n, k, mid):
            beg = mid
        else:
            end = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final values of `beg`, `end`, and `mid` will be such that `beg` is equal to `end`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to narrow down the range between `beg` and `end` until they converge. After each iteration, `mid` is recalculated as the midpoint of the current range. Depending on the outcome of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, either `beg` or `end` is updated. Eventually, when `beg` equals `end`, the condition `beg < end` fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, both `beg` and `end` will hold the same value, which is the result of the binary search performed by the loop.
    return beg
    #The program returns the value of `beg` (or `end`) which is the point where the binary search converges, meaning `beg` and `end` are equal after the loop terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), the number of vertices `n`, and the number of edges `k` to be removed such that 1 ≤ k < n. It performs a binary search to find a point `beg` (or `end`) where the condition converges, meaning `beg` and `end` are equal after the loop terminates, and returns this value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `beg` (or `end`) which is the point where the binary search converges, meaning `beg` and `end` are equal after the loop terminates.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
