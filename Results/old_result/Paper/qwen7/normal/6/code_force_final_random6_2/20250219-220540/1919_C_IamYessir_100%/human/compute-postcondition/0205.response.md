Output State: **`a` and `b` are both empty lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)` + 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `None`, `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, and the current value of `b` is `[lit[i]]` and the current value of `x` is less than or equal to the current value of `y`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to list `b`. Since `i` was originally `len(b)`, appending `lit[i]` to `b` increases the length of `b` by 1, making `i` now equal to `len(b) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
