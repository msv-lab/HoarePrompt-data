Output State: `position` is 5, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. Each iteration of the loop performs two operations: `n >>= 1` (which means `n` is divided by 2 and truncated towards zero) and `position += 1`. Given that `n` becomes 0 after the third iteration, it implies that `n` was initially a power of 2 greater than or equal to 2^4 (since `n` became 0 after 4 divisions). Therefore, after 4 iterations, `position` will be 5, and `n` will be 0. The value of `t` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
