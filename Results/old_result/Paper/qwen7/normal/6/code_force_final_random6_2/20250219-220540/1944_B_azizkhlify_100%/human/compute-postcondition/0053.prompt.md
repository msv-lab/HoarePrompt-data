Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed `n` times, so `i` is equal to `n-1`. The variable `r[a[i] - 1]` has been incremented `n` times, corresponding to each unique value in the list `a`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `res`) remain in their initial states.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `r` will contain counts of each unique element in the list `a`, starting from `a[0] - 1` up to the maximum value in `a` minus one. The other variables will retain their initial values, with `i` being set to `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `ul` is increased by 2 if the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 and the condition `ul == k * 2` is met. If the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 2 or the condition `ul == k * 2` is not met, the values of `l` and `ul` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `x + 1`, `n` is `y`, `ul` is `z + 2`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged as `0`. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, these conditions hold true. If `ul` does not equal `k * 2`, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `x + 2`, `n` is `y`, `ul` is `z + 4`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is `0`. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
