Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `vis[s]` is 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**

Explanation: The code updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value (`mx`) and the new value of `cur + k * a[s]`. The other variables (`cur`, `k`, `vis[s]`, and `s`) are also updated according to their respective operations.
