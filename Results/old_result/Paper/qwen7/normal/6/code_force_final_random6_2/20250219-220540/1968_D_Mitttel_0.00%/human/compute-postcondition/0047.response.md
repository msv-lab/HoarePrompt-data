Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `results` contains at least one element.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `result` is the next element in the `results` list.
   - `results` must still contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `result` is now the next element in the `results` list, it means `results` has lost one element (the one that was just used).
   - For the loop to continue, `results` must still contain at least one element.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `result` will be the next element in the updated `results` list.
   - `results` will have one less element than before, but it must still contain at least one element.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration is:

```
State:
- `result` is the next element in the `results` list.
- `results` must still contain at least one element.
```

However, to be more specific about the exact values:

- `result` will be the next element in the updated `results` list.
- `results` will have one less element than before, but it must still contain at least one element.

So, the final answer is:

```
State: **`result` is the next element in the `results` list, `results` must still contain at least one element**
```
