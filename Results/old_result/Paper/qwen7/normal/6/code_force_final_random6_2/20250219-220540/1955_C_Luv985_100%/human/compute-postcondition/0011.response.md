Output State: **`T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq T \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n` is an integer converted from the first word of the input split by space; `k` is an integer converted from the second word of the input split by space; `a` is a list containing two elements, both elements are integers, the first element is the first word of the input converted to an integer and the second element is the second word of the input converted to an integer; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
