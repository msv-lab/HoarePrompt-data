Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is `k - (min(a[l], a[r]) * 2)`, `l` is `l + 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` or `a[r - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2` if the condition is false, `a[r]` or `a[r - 1]` is decreased by `mi`.

This means that if `a[r]` equals 0, then `r` is decremented by 1, `a[r]` (or `a[r - 1]` if `r` was decremented) is decreased by the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` (or `a[r - 1]`), and the other variables (`ans`, `T`, `k`, `mi`, `t`) retain their values as specified in the if part. If the condition `a[r] == 0` is not met, the postcondition remains unchanged.
