Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `n` is greater than 3, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- There is a condition that checks if `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`. Since `i` is 1, and no information is given about `mpp`, we assume that `i` (which is 1) is not a key in `mpp`.

Given this information, the condition `if i not in mpp.keys():` will evaluate to `True` because `i` (which is 1) is not a key in `mpp`. As a result, the code will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the print statement `print(i)` will execute and print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
