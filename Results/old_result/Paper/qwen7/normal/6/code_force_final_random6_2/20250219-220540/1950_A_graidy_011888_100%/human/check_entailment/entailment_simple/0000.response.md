Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The conditions for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented:
   - `if a < b < c:` checks for a stair.
   - `elif a < b and b > c:` checks for a peak.
4. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
5. The logic and conditions match the problem statement accurately.
6. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code based on the provided problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
