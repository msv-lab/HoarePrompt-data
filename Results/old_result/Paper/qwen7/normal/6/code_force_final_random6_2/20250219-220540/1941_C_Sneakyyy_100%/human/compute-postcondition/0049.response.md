Output State: **`a` is the new input string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 0 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', `i` is 6 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and `i` is 4 otherwise.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 3, so if `s` was originally 3 (which means `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'), then `i` becomes 6. If `s` was originally 1 (which means `s` is not 'map' or 'pie'), then `i` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
