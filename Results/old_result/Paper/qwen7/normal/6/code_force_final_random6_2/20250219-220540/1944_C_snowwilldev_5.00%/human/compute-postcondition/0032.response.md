Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `N` must still be greater than 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in `range(N)`.

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `N`.

4. **Postcondition:**
   - If `t` is at least 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - This postcondition does not directly affect the loop condition but influences whether the loop continues or breaks.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs from `i` in `range(N)`, the loop will continue as long as `i < N`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` must still be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `N` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` should be 2.
- `N` must still be greater than 0.

**State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, and `N` must still be greater than 0**
