You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. Additionally, the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series `n / 2 - 1 / 2 + 1`, `((n / 3) - 1) / 3 + 1`, ..., `((n / m) - 1) / m + 1`, `count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, and `g` is `n / m - m - 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on \( n \) and \( m \) using a specific formula and prints the result. The function ensures that the input values meet certain constraints (i.e., \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6 \), and the sum of \( n \) and \( m \) does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^6 \)). After processing all test cases, the function prints the calculated value for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This suggests that initially, the program assumes all pairs `(a, b)` where `b = 1` are valid, which is not necessarily true based on the problem statement.

3. **Loop through possible values of `b`:**
   - The loop runs from `count = 2` to `count <= m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the result is printed as an integer.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Problem Statement Recap
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Issues with the Given Code
1. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `n`, which assumes all pairs `(a, 1)` are valid. However, this is not correct because the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be checked for all pairs.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates over possible values of `b` starting from 2 up to `m`.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs. Specifically, the calculation of `g` and its use in updating `ans` does not follow the required condition.

3. **Handling GCD:**
   - The code does not explicitly handle the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly addressed.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
