Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (greater than 3).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 3**.
