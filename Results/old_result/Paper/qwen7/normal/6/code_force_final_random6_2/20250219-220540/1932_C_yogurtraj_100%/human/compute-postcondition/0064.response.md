Postcondition: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an input string, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `a[l] % m` otherwise, `q1` is either `l - 2` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `l - 1` otherwise, `q2` is either `l` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `l + 1` otherwise, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.**
