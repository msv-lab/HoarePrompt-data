Output State: **`cp` is 0; `t` must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers; `a` is a list with its last element being `lit[i]`; `i` is 0; `x` is less than `y`; `x` is not equal to `y`; `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 0, `lit[i]` refers to the first element of the list `lit`. Therefore, `a` now contains its original elements plus the first element of `lit`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
