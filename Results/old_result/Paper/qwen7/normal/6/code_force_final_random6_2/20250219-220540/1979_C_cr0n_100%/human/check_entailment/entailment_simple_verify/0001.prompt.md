You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. 

### Given Code Analysis
The code provided has two functions:

1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).

2. **func_2()**: This function processes the input and outputs the required distribution of coins.

#### func_2() Breakdown
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `N = int(input().strip())`: Reads the number of outcomes.
   - `vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]`: Reads the multipliers for each outcome and stores them in a list `vals`.

2. **Calculating Denominator**:
   - `den = vals[0]`: Initializes the denominator with the first multiplier.
   - `for x in vals: den = func_1(den, x)`: Iterates through the multipliers and updates the denominator to the LCM of all multipliers.

3. **Calculating Values**:
   - `vprod = [den // r for r in vals]`: Calculates the value to bet on each outcome as `den // r` where `r` is the multiplier.
   - `den = den - sum(vprod)`: Adjusts the denominator by subtracting the sum of the calculated values.

4. **Output**:
   - If `den <= 0`, prints `-1` indicating no valid solution.
   - Otherwise, prints the values to bet on each outcome.

### Correctness Analysis
To verify the correctness, let's consider the logic and constraints:

1. **Denominator Calculation**:
   - The denominator `den` is set to the LCM of all multipliers. This ensures that the distribution is fair and balanced across all outcomes.

2. **Value Calculation**:
   - The value to bet on each outcome is calculated as `den // r`. This ensures that the total bet is evenly distributed and leverages the LCM property.

3. **Adjustment**:
   - Subtracting the sum of the calculated values from `den` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the total bet is not strictly less than the amount received back by checking if `den <= 0` and printing `-1` if true.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to distribute coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. It handles edge cases appropriately and uses the LCM to ensure an even distribution.
