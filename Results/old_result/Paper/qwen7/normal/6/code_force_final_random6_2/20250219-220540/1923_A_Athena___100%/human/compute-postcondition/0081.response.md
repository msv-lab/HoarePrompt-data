Output State: **`a` is non-empty and the first element of `a` is the second element of the original list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is non-empty and the first element is 0, after executing the code, the first element of `a` will now be the second element of the original list `a`.
