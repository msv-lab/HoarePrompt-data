Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Logic:**
   - The program checks if the price of two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`B`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
       - In this case, the program prints `A * B`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts at the individual price.
     - Otherwise, the program proceeds to the next logic.
   
3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` is even, the program calculates the cost of buying all yogurts at the promotion price.
     - It prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost of buying `A/2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
   
4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` is odd, the program calculates the cost of buying the maximum number of pairs at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the individual price.
     - It calculates `X = A // 2`, which represents the number of pairs that can be bought at the promotion price.
     - It then prints `X * C + B`, which is the total cost of buying `X` pairs at the promotion price plus one additional yogurt at the individual price.
   
### Correctness Check

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Output: `9`
   - Explanation: Since `5 * 2 > 9`, it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. So, `2 * 5 = 10` would be incorrect; the correct output is `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Output: `14`
   - Explanation: Since `5 * 2 > 9`, it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. So, `3 * 5 = 15` would be incorrect; the correct output is `14`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Output: `15`
   - Explanation: Since `5 * 2 < 11`, it's cheaper to buy the yogurts at the promotion price. So, `3 * (11 / 2) = 16.5` rounded down to `16` would be incorrect; the correct output is `15`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Output: `20`
   - Explanation: Since `5 * 2 < 11`, it's cheaper to buy the yogurts at the promotion price. So, `4 * (11 / 2) = 22` would be incorrect; the correct output is `20`.

### Conclusion

The program does not handle the case where the promotion price is cheaper correctly. Specifically, it does not calculate the minimum cost when the promotion price is cheaper. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
