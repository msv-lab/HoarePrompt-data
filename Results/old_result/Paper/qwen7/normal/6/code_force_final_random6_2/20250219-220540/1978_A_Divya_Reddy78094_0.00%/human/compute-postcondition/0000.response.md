Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer input value; `n` is an unknown integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the number of pages in each book is yet to be defined.**

This output state reflects that `t` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user, while `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain undefined until further input or operations are performed.
