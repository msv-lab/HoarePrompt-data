The function processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^18. It calculates a sequence of integers based on certain conditions and prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself. The function does not return any value but prints the final sequence length and the sequence.
