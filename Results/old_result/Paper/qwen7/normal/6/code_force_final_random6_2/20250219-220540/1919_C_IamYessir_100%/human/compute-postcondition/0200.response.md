Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `b` is a list containing the i-th element of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is the length of `b`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `None`, `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, and the current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the current value of `y`.**

Explanation: The code appends the i-th element of `lit` to the list `b`. Since `i` is the length of `b`, `b` will contain only one element after this operation, which is the i-th element of `lit`. All other variables remain unchanged.
