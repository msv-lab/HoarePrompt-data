Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `k`: Integers from the input, split by space and converted to int.
   - `l`: An empty list.
   - `c`: The final cumulative value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `maxi`: The maximum value between the original `maxi` and the value of `c` when `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)` is false, or 0 when it is true.

2. **Loop and conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over elements in the list `l`, but since `l` is initially empty, the loop body does not execute, meaning `c` remains undefined and `maxi` also remains undefined.

3. **Expression to be evaluated:**
   ```python
   (2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007
   ```

4. **Substituting the values:**
   - Since `l` is an empty list, `sum(l)` is 0.
   - `maxi` is undefined, so we consider the default value to be 0 (since no value of `c` has been updated yet).

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
```python
(2 ** k * 0 - 0 + 0) % 1000000007
```
Which further simplifies to:
```python
0 % 1000000007
```
And the result is:
```python
0
```

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **0**
