Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input string, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the integer value of `math.ceil(k / m)`, `n` is the length of the list `N` minus 1, `L[0]` is assigned to `n`, `L[1]` is assigned to `m`, `L[2]` is assigned to `k`, `N` is the list containing the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` pops the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to `w`. This reduces the length of `N` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions or values derived from the initial state.
