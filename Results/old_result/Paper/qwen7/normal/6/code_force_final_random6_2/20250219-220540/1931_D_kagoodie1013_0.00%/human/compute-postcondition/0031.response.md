Output State: **`results` contains the final value of `count`, `count` reflects the cumulative sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for every `num` in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains the frequency of each modulus result for `x` across all elements in `arr`, `mod_y_map` contains the frequency of each modulus result for `y` across all elements in `arr`, `arr` retains its initial list of tuples, and `num` is the last element processed in `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`. The value of `count` is the cumulative sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for every `num` in `arr`. The dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are updated during the loop to keep track of the frequency of each modulus result for `x` and `y` respectively. The list `arr` and the variable `num` retain their initial values, with `num` being the last element processed in `arr`.
