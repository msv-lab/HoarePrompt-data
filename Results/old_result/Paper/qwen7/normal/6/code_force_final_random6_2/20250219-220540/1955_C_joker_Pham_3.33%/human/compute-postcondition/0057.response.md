Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is greater than or equal to \(a[r] \times 2 - a[r] \times 2\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is either 1, 2, or 3, and the current value of `a[r]` is now less than the current value of `a[l]` by the amount of `a[r]`. Additionally, `a[l]` is currently 0.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` was equal to `r`, and since `r` is `n - 1`, `l` is now `n`. Therefore, `l` is updated to `n`, making `l` equal to `r` + 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
