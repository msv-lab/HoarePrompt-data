Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but no changes to variables are observed within the given code snippet. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and no new information about `t` is provided. Therefore, the only information we can confidently state is that `t` must still be greater than 0.
