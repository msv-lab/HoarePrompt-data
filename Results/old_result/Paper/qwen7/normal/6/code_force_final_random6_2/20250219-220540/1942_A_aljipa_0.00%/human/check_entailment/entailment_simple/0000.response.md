Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading `n` and `k` for each case.
3. The logic for determining the result `res` based on the conditions is as follows:
   - If `k == n`, it generates an array of `1`s of length `n`.
   - If `k == 1`, it generates an array where the elements are in ascending order from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `res` to `[-1]`, indicating no valid array exists.
4. The program prints the result for each test case.
5. The final state of `t` being `0` indicates the end of all test cases has been processed.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- When `k == n`, the array should contain distinct values to ensure only one cyclic shift is sorted. Using all `1`s does not meet this requirement.
- When `k == 1`, the array should be in ascending order, but using `range(n)` directly might not work as expected because `range(n)` returns a sequence of numbers starting from `0` to `n-1`, which might not fit the requirement of having exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

Given these points, the current implementation does not fully address the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
