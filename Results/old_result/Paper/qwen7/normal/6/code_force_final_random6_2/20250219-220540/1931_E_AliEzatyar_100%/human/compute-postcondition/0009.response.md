Output State: **`counter` is 2 if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0', otherwise `counter` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 2`**

Explanation: The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. If `num[len(num) - 1]` was '0' initially, making `counter` equal to 1, then after executing `counter += 1`, `counter` becomes 2. If `num[len(num) - 1]` was not '0', `counter` was already 0, and after executing `counter += 1`, `counter` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only modifies `counter`.
