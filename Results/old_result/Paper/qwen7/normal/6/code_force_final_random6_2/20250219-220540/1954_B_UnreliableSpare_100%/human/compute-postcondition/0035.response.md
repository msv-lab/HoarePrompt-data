Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 0**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for updating `ans` to the minimum of its current value and 0 is not directly affected by this line of code, so `ans` remains as it was initially.
