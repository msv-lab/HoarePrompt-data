Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be 0 (assuming this is the first iteration).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 0, `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - There is no direct change to `l[a[i] - 1]` in the loop head, so this state remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 because the loop needs to continue.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 1 for the next iteration.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we don't change this state here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
