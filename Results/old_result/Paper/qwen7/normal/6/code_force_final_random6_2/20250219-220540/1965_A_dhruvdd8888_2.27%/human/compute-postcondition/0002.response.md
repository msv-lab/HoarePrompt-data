Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` sorts the elements of the `nums` set (which contains integers) into a list in ascending order. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged.
