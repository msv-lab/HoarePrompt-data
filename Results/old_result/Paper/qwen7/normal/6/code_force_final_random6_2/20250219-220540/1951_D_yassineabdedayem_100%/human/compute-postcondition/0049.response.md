Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks specific conditions involving \( n \) and \( k \) and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with some integers if applicable. If \( n \) equals \( k \), it prints 'YES 1 1'. If \( n + 2 \) is greater than \( 2k \), it prints 'YES 2' followed by \( n - k + 1 \) and 1. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
