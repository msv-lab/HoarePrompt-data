Postcondition: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1; `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `l` is 0 and `r` is `mid` - 1. If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, then `l` is `mid` + 1 and `r` is n - 1.
