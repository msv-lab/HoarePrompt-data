Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n`.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two lists `values` and `sum_values` with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`.
   - It also initializes a variable `total` to store the cumulative sum of digits.
   - This part is correct and necessary for the algorithm.

3. **Handling Single-Digit Numbers:**
   - For numbers from 0 to 9, the program directly assigns the digit itself to `values[i]` and updates `total` and `sum_values`.
   - This part is correct and handles the base case.

4. **Handling Multi-Digit Numbers:**
   - For numbers from 10 to `n`, the program converts the number to a string, extracts the last digit, and the remaining part.
   - It then recursively calculates the sum of digits using previously computed values.
   - This part is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the sum of digits for multi-digit numbers. Instead of summing the digits, it adds the values of the last digit and the remaining part, which is not the correct approach.

5. **Updating Sum Values:**
   - The program updates `sum_values` by adding the current value to the previous sum.
   - This part is correct but relies on the incorrect calculation of `values`.

6. **Outputting Results:**
   - The program iterates over the list of numbers and prints the corresponding sum from `sum_values`.
   - This part is correct but again, it relies on the incorrect calculation of `values`.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `n` and then sum these results. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total_sum += sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the sum of digits for multi-digit numbers. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
