Output State: **`s` is the next line from the input, `n` is an integer from the first part of `s`, `k` is an integer from the second part of `s`, and the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to integers.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `s` using whitespace as the delimiter and then converts each part to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This means that the original values of `n` and `k` are now integer values derived from the split parts of `s`. The variable `s` remains unchanged, holding the next line from the input.
