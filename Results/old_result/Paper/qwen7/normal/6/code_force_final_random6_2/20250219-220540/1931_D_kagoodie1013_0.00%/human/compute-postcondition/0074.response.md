Output State: **`count` is `num % y` + 0, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` by incrementing it by 1. Since `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, and initially `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` was mapped to 1, after executing the line `mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1`, the value of `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
