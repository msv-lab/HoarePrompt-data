### Reasoning

Based on the detailed analysis provided in the original assessment, let's re-evaluate the code step by step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1`**
   - This function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares their scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
   - The logic is straightforward and correct.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**
   - This function simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It handles cycles efficiently by detecting them and optimizing the score calculation.
   - The cycle detection and score calculation logic is correct.
   - The use of modular arithmetic to handle cycles is appropriate and ensures the score is computed correctly.

3. **Function `func_2`**
   - This function reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the entire input into a string, splits it, and processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It prints the results for each test case.
   - The handling of input and output is correct and follows the problem requirements.

Given the detailed annotations and the original assessment, the code appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately. The functions handle the game simulation, cycle detection, and input/output operations as required.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
