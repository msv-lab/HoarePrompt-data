Output: **()**

Explanation:
- `ldb` is initially empty and remains empty after the loop.
- `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, but this list is not used in the `print` statement.
- `sz` is set to `k + 3` after the loop, but this value is not printed.
- `sng` must contain at least two elements, and the second element of `sng` is printed in the second iteration of the loop. However, since no specific value for `sng` is provided, the only thing that is explicitly printed is an empty tuple `()` if no other elements are printed due to the lack of a specific print statement for `sng`'s second element.

Given the provided code snippet and the initial state, the only thing that is explicitly printed is an empty tuple `()`.
