Output State: **`a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` must be 2, `r` must be `n-2`, `ans` is either 3 or 2, `t` is `k % 2`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
