Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[n-2]`, `x` is `x + min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`, if `i < m`, `pergunta` and `x` retain these updates, if `i >= m`, the values of `pergunta` and `x` remain unchanged from their preconditions.**

Explanation: The code `x += min(a[i], b[i])` updates the value of `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`. Since `i` is `n-2`, the index `i` is valid as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The value of `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[n-2]`. If `i < m`, both `pergunta` and `x` retain these updates. If `i >= m`, the values of `pergunta` and `x` remain unchanged from their preconditions.
