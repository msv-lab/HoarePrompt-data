Postcondition: `a` is the new input string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is 3 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 2 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', `i` is 9 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and `i` is 5 otherwise, where `s` is `a[3:6]`, and `len(a)` must be greater than 6; `s` is updated to `a[i:i + 3]`.
