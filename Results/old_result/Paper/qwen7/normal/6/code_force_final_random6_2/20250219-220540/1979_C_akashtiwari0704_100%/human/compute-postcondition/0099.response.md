Functionality: **The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` and calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list. It does this by initializing a variable `g` to 1 and then iterating over each element in `l`. During each iteration, `g` is updated to the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd) with `g`. After completing all iterations, the function returns the value of `g`, which represents the LCM of all elements in `l`, and sets the index variable `i` to the length of the list `l`, indicating that the loop has completed.**
