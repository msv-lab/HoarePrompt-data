Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 3
- `i` is 2
- `N` is greater than 0
- If `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` would change to 2, `i` would change to 2, and `N` would remain greater than 0. However, since no other conditions are specified, we assume the default case where `cnt[i]` does not equal 1.

Therefore, `t` remains 3, `i` remains 2, and `N` remains greater than 0.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

Output: **2**
