Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game played by two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their starting positions in a permutation and the values associated with those positions. Both players take turns moving through the permutation and adding the corresponding values to their scores until the game ends after \( k \) turns.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the rules of the game. It uses the `calculate_score` function to compute the score for a given starting position.
   - **`calculate_score`**: This function computes the score by traversing the permutation starting from a given position. If a cycle is detected, it adjusts the score accordingly. The logic seems sound and correctly accounts for the cyclic nature of the permutation.
   - **`func_2`**: This function reads input data, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to get the result for each test case. It then prints the results. The input reading and processing logic seems correct.

3. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The code handles the detection of cycles in the permutation, which is crucial for calculating the scores accurately.
   - The code correctly updates the score based on whether a cycle is detected or not.
   - The overall structure of the code ensures that the game is played according to the rules and the results are computed correctly.

4. **Execution States**:
   - The provided execution states in the comments match the expected behavior of the functions.
   - The transitions and state changes in `calculate_score` are correctly described and implemented.
   - The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the implementation of the functions and their interactions appear to be correct and handle all aspects of the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
