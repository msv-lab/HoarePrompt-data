Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` for multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if the list is beautiful (i.e., all elements are the same) and finds the minimum length of consecutive identical elements. If the list is beautiful, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.**
