Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of N integers, `den` is the result of applying `func_1` successively to the elements of `vals` starting with the first element and using each subsequent element as the argument for `func_1`, `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` using integer division.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `vprod` where each element is the result of integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`. The values of `N`, `vals`, and `den` remain unchanged from their initial state.
