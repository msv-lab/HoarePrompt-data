Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 0, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is 0, `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + ans[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the `ans` list such that each element `ans[i + 1]` is set to the sum of `arr[i]` and `ans[i]`. Given the initial conditions, `ans[0]` is already defined as `arr[0] + 1`, and `i` starts at 0. The line `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` will compute the next value in the `ans` list based on the current value of `i`. Since `i` is initially 0, the next value `ans[1]` will be `arr[0] + ans[0]`, which simplifies to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1) = 2 * arr[0] + 1`. This process continues for subsequent elements, updating the `ans` list accordingly.
