Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is True, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `y` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\), `a` and `b` are integers that are inputs to the loop, with `a` being the first integer and `b` being the second integer from each input pair, `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, and for every pair `(a, b)` that was input, both `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` will contain each other
Code of the loop:
while lst[x]:
    y = lst[x].pop()
    if lst[y] != []:
        x = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping it, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\), `a` and `b` are integers that are inputs to the loop, with `a` being the first integer and `b` being the second integer from each input pair, `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, and for every pair `(a, b)` that was input, both `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` will contain each other, and if `lst[y]` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is now the second-to-last element of `lst[x]` after popping the last element, `lst[x]` has at least one element left, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\), `a` and `b` are integers that are inputs to the loop, with `a` being the first integer and `b` being the second integer from each input pair, `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, and `x` is now equal to `y` after breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the new last element of `lst[x]` after the pop operation, `lst[x]` has at least one element left, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\), `a` and `b` are integers that are inputs to the loop, with `a` being the first integer and `b` being the second integer from each input pair, `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, and either `x` is now equal to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no else part and the conditions remain as they were.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
