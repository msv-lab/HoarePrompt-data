Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `j` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the variables `t`, `r`, `f`, `n`, `num`, and `j` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values but simply continues the loop if it was inside one.
