Output State: **`i` is 10, `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 489, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10, 10]**.

Explanation: The code `subseq_lens.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 10) to the list `subseq_lens`. Initially, `subseq_lens` contains `[10]`. After appending, `subseq_lens` becomes `[10, 10]`. The values of `i`, `mx`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged.
