Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `idx` is equal to `4 + n`. This means that `n` is part of the initial state.
   - `i` is the variable that will iterate from `0` to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means `i` should start from `0` and increment until it reaches `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments, we don't need to explicitly set `i` to `0` initially; we just need to ensure that `n` is non-negative.

Given the above points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `n` must be non-negative.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`cnt` is 0, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is 0, `n` must be non-negative**
