Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k` is greater than or equal to \(2 * a[l]\), then `k` is reduced by \(2 * a[l]\), `l` is increased by 1, and `sunks` is set to 2. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k` equals \(2 * a[l] - 1\), then `sunks` is set to 1 and `a[l]` is set to \(\frac{k + 1}{2}\). If `a[l] <= a[r]` and none of the above conditions are met, `sunks` remains unchanged.
