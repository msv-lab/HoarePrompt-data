Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is 0, `vis[s]` is 1.**

Explanation: The line of code updates `mx` to be the maximum value between its current value (which is 0) and the sum of `cur` (which is 0) and `k` times `a[s]`. Since `cur` is 0, `mx` will be updated to the value of `k * a[s]` if it is greater than 0. The values of `cur` and `vis[s]` remain unchanged.
