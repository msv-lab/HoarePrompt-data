Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is adjusted based on the condition (`k - 2 * mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged), `l` is adjusted accordingly (`l + 1` less than `r` if `a[l]` equals 0, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, and `r` is decremented by 1 if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `r` remains unchanged), `a[r]` is reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the else part is executed.
