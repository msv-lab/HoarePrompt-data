Output State: **`beg`, `end`, and `mid` are adjusted based on the outcome of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, and `end` is now equal to `mid - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `end` to `mid - 1`. The values of `beg` and `mid` remain unchanged from their previous adjustments based on the outcome of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. The new value of `end` is calculated directly from the updated `mid`.
