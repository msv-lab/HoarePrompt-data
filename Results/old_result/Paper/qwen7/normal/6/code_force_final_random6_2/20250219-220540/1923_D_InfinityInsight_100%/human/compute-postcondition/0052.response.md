Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` is 4 - `inx2`, `i` is 3, `a` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx2` is the value of `last[2]`, and if `inx < 0`, then `inx` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `ans[3]` is updated to `3 + 1 - inx2`, which simplifies to `4 - inx2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
