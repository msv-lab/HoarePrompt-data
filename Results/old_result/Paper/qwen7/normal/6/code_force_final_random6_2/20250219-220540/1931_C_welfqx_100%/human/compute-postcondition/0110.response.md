Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to `0` (since `range(n - 1)` starts from `0`).
   - `n` is already given as being greater than 1.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(n - 1):` to execute, `n - 1` must be at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2. This condition is already satisfied since `n` is given as greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to `0` and `n` is greater than 1, the loop can start executing.
   - No other states need adjustment because the loop head only involves `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1**
