Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: We need to ensure that both parts of the condition are true for the next iteration of the loop.
   - The first part of the condition is `r > l`.
   - The second part of the condition is `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

3. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l` is `n - 1`
   - `r` is `n - 3`
   - `st` is `n - 3`
   - `end` is increased by 1 (though `end` is not used in the loop condition, we still need to consider it as part of the overall state).

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `r` is `n - 3` and `l` is `n - 1`. Since `n - 3` is less than `n - 1`, the condition `r > l` is currently false.
   - We need to adjust the states such that `r > l` becomes true.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - To satisfy `r > l`, we need to decrease `l` or increase `r`.
   - Since `r` is already `n - 3`, increasing `r` would violate the condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` because `r - 1` would be `n - 4`, and we don't know the value of `a[n - 4]`.
   - Therefore, we need to decrease `l` to make `r > l` true. The smallest possible value for `l` that satisfies `r > l` is `r + 1`, which is `n - 2`.

6. **Final state**:
   - `l` must be `n - 2` to satisfy `r > l`.
   - `r` remains `n - 3` to satisfy `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

So, the final state for the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 3`, `st` is `n - 3`, `end` is increased by 1**
