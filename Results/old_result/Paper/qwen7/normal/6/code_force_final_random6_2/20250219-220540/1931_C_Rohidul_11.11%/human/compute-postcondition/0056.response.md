Output State: `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 2`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `l` and increase `st` as long as `l` is less than `r` and the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`. Given that the loop executed 3 times initially, it suggests there were at least three consecutive elements that were the same. Since `l` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, and `r` remains `n - 1` (as it's not modified within the loop), when the loop terminates, `l` will be equal to `r`, which is `n - 1`. The value of `st` will be `n - 2` because `l` started from 0 and was incremented `n - 2` times to reach `n - 1`.
