Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is an empty list.
- `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The current value of `a[i] - 1` index in `r` is 2.

From this, we can infer that `a[i]` must be 3 because `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, meaning `a[i] - 1 = 2`, so `a[i] = 3`.

Therefore, the `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space but without a newline due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **3 3**
