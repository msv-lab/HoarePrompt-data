Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for `func_1` Function**: 
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find all divisors of a number `x`. However, it appends the divisors in reverse order to `output1` and then appends them to `output2`. This results in the divisors being in the wrong order when returned.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Valid `k` Values**:
   - The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x` is used to filter valid `k` values. This condition is incorrect because it checks if `(s + 2)` is even and greater than or equal to `x`, but it should check if `s` is even and greater than or equal to `x`.

3. **Redundant Use of `set`**:
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates is unnecessary since the divisors found by `func_1` are already unique.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where `n` and `x` might lead to invalid `k` values.

### Corrected Solution:

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    
    # Check the first condition
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        k = (n + x - 2) // 2
        if k >= x:
            output.append(k)
    
    # Check the second condition
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        k = (n - x) // 2
        if k >= x:
            output.append(k)
    
    # Remove duplicates and print the count
    print(len(set(output)))
```

This corrected solution directly calculates the possible values of `k` based on the conditions and ensures that the results are unique before printing the count.
