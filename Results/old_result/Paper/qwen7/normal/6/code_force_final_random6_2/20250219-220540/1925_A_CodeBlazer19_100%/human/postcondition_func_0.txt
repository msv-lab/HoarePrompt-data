The function processes a series of test cases defined by the variable `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then prints a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet ('a' to 'z') repeated `n` times. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the original value of `t` remaining unchanged within the specified range (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676).
