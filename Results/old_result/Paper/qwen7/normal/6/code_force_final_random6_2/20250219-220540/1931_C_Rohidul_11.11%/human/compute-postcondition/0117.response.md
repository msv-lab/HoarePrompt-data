Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is 0, `st` is `n - 3`, `end` is 3, `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`**, and `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.

Explanation: The code assigns `len(a) - 1` to `ans`. Since `len(a)` was not specified initially, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `end` was increased by 3 from its initial value of 0, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
