Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `i + 1`. This means `i` is set to a value that is one more than some previous value of `i`, but the exact value is not specified.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
