Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `first` is True, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a `Counter` object named `mpp` that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `arr`. The values of `i`, `n`, `first`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
