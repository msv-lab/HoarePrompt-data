You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 0, `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 489, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10, 10].
    #
    #Explanation: After the first three iterations, the value of `i` can either be 0 or 10. If `i` is 0, the loop breaks immediately as it does not satisfy the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. Therefore, `i` remains 0, and no further iterations occur. The value of `mx` remains 10 because it was last updated to 10 during the third iteration, and `x` is reduced to 489 after the third iteration. The list `subseq_lens` contains [10, 10] because `i` was 10 twice in the previous iterations. If `i` is 10, the loop continues, but since `x` is now 489, the inner while loop's condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` will not be satisfied for any `i`, leading to the same final state as when `i` is 0.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 5; `ansv` contains the elements `subseq_lens[2]`, `subseq_lens[3]`, and `subseq_lens[4]`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `len(subseq_lens) - 1`. Given `subseq_lens` is a list with 2 elements, the loop will run until `i` reaches 4 (since `range(1, len(subseq_lens))` means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `len(subseq_lens)`). After the loop completes, `i` will be 5, and `ansv` will contain the elements `subseq_lens[1]`, `subseq_lens[2]`, and `subseq_lens[3]`, which are `[10, 10, 10]` based on the initial list provided.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 3
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `i` is 5, `ansv` contains the elements `[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`
    print()
    #This is printed: None



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not consider the case where `X` is a prime number greater than 2. For such values of `X`, it is impossible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences because `X` cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1 (which is how the program constructs the array).

For example, if `X = 3`, the program will attempt to construct an array but will fail to do so correctly. The correct approach would be to recognize that for `X = 3`, we can use an array like `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 3 increasing subsequences. However, the provided program does not handle this case and will output `-1` instead.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
