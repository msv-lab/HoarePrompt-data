### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness, focusing on the key aspects highlighted in the original assessment and the provided annotations.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - An empty list `array` and an empty list `result` are initialized.
2. **Processing Operations**:
   - For each operation in `operations`, if the operation type (`op_type`) is 1, the value is appended to `array`.
   - If the operation type is 2, the entire `array` is extended by repeating itself `value` times.
3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query `k` in `queries`, the `k`-th element of `array` (considering 1-based indexing) is computed using `(k - 1) % len(array)` and appended to `result`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q` are read.
   - The operations are read and stored in a list of lists `operations`.
   - The queries are read and stored in a list `queries`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments.
   - The result from `func_1` is printed.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Operation Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles appending elements and extending the array as specified.
   - The extension operation `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` effectively doubles the length of the array, maintaining the structure as required.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)` is used to wrap around the index in the array. This is generally correct for finding the `k`-th element in a circular array, but we need to consider edge cases where the length of the array might be very small compared to `k`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that there will be at least one operation of the first type before any operation of the second type, so the array will never be empty when handling queries.
   - The modulo operation should work correctly within the constraints provided. However, we need to ensure that the length of the array is always sufficient to cover the largest possible `k` in the queries.

### Key Points to Verify

- **Array Length and Queries**:
  - The array length grows exponentially due to the doubling operation. Even if the array length is small, the modulo operation will correctly wrap around to the appropriate position.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the index is always within the bounds of the current array length.

- **Guaranteed Constraints**:
  - The problem guarantees that the array will never be empty when handling queries, and the modulo operation will handle wrapping around correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program appears to be correct. The modulo operation ensures that even if `k` is larger than the current length of the array, it wraps around correctly. The exponential growth of the array length ensures that the queries can always be handled accurately.
