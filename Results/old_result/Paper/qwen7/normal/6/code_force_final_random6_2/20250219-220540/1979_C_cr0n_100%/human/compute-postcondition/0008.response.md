Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of `N` integers, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)` where `x` is the third element of `vals`, and `den` is updated to be the result of `func_1(den, x)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `den` to be the result of `func_1(den, x)`, where `x` is the third element of the list `vals`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
