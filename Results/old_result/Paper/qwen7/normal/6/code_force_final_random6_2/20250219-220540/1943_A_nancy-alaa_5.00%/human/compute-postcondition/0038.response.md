Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement. However, since the initial conditions for `i` and `n` are not altered by the `break` statement itself, they remain as specified in the initial state.
