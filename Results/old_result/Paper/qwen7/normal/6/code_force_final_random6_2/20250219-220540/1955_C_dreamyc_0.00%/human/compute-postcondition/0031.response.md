Output State: **`a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`; `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`; `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state; `ans` is either 1 or 2; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `k` must be greater than 0; `n` must be at least 2; `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`; `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`**

Explanation: The code `a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()` removes the first element from `nums` and assigns it to `a`, and removes the last element from `nums` and assigns it to `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `t`, `k`, `n`, or `x`. The value of `x` remains the minimum of `a` and `b`. Depending on the value of `ans`, `b` will either be less than or equal to 0 or appended back to `nums`.
