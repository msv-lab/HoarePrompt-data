Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the stripped input string to the variable `b`. The variable `results` remains an empty list as no operation was performed on it. The initial state of `a` being an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace is now reflected in `b`.
