Postcondition: `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is not equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is not executed, and the values of `res`, `ans`, and `i` remain as specified in the precondition. If `dif` equals 0, `res` is set to -2, and the values of `i`, `ans`, and `dif` remain unchanged.
