Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program uses `mod_x = -num % x` which is incorrect because it does not handle negative numbers properly. For example, if `x = 5` and `num = 3`, `-num % x` would yield `2` instead of `3`. This can lead to incorrect counts of beautiful pairs.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 5 2
  1 2 7 4 9 6
  ```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program might produce an incorrect result due to the improper calculation of `mod_x`.

A corrected version of the program should use `(num + x - 1) % x` to ensure that the modulo operation handles negative numbers correctly. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the program:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = (num + x - 1) % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = (num + x - 1) % x
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This correction ensures that the modulo operation handles negative numbers correctly, leading to the correct count of beautiful pairs.
