Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `i` is 3, `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, and `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1` calculates the value of `x` based on the values of `left[i]` and `a[i]`. Since `i` is 3, `x` is set to `left[3] - a[3] - 1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
