Output State: **`i` is now `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`; `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[i]` from the previous state.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. After appending, the value of `i` increments by 1 (though the exact new value of `i` is not specified, it is understood to be `i + 1`). All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
