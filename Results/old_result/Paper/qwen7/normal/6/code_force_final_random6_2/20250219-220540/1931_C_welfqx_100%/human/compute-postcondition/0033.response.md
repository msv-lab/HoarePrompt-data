Output State: **`ck` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `cn` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the list `onum`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `onum` (which is the reversed copy of `num`) to the variable `symb2`. Since `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, the first element of `onum` is the same as the last element of `num`. Therefore, `symb2` is set to the last element of the original list `num`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
