Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. If `lst` does not have 2 elements, `ans` remains unchanged from its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` and either the previous value of `ans` (if the second element was removed) or its previous value plus the update due to the removal of the second element.
