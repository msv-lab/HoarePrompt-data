Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `vis[s]` is 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**

Explanation: The code `cur += a[s]` increments the value of `cur` by `a[s]`. The other variables (`mx`, `k`, `vis[s]`, `s`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `cur` and the unchanged states of the other variables.
