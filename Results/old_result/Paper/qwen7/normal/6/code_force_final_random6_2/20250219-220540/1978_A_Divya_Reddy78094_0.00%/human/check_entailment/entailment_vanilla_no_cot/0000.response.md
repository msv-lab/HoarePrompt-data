Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution only considers the sum of the top two largest numbers in the sorted list, which does not necessarily maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by optimally dividing the books into two piles.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the optimal way to split the books such that the sum of the second-largest values in both piles is maximized. Here's a corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # The optimal strategy is to put the largest book in one pile and the next largest in the other pile.
        # This ensures that the second-largest books in both piles are maximized.
        max_pages = nums[0] + nums[1]
        results.append(max_pages)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This solution sorts the books in descending order and then sums the first two elements, which represent the optimal division where the second-largest books from each pile are maximized.
