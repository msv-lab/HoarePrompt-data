Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after these operations.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key insight is that adding a subarray's sum multiple times (up to `k` times) can significantly increase the array's sum.
   - The optimal strategy is often to add the sum of the entire array `k` times, especially if the array contains positive numbers or if the negative numbers are outweighed by positive ones.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, followed by the size of the array and the number of operations for each test case, and the array itself.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to find the maximum sum segment in the array. However, the logic seems overly complex and may not be necessary for the solution. The main idea should be to identify the segment with the highest sum.
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the remainder of the number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\), which is essential for handling large sums.
   - **Main Logic**: The main logic calculates the maximum possible sum after `k` operations. It uses the result from `func_2` to adjust the sum of the array accordingly. If the maximum segment sum is negative, it treats it as zero, which is a reasonable simplification since adding a negative segment would not help in increasing the sum.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the required bounds.
   - The logic to calculate the maximum possible sum after `k` operations appears to be sound, especially if the array contains positive numbers or if the negative numbers are outweighed by positive ones.
   - The program does not modify the array directly but works with the sum of the array and the maximum segment sum, which is a valid approach.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct in its logic and implementation.

Correctness: **True**
