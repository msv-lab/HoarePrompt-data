Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` does not contain a 0, `res` is 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` must contain at least one 0 before the execution, after executing `a.pop()`, `a` no longer contains a 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
