Output State: **`arr` is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \), `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is updated such that `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` and `ans[3]` is less than or equal to `arr[2] + ans[2]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates each element in the `ans` list starting from the third element (index 3). Specifically, it sets `ans[3]` to `arr[2] + ans[2]`, and continues this pattern for subsequent elements. Since the initial condition is that `ans[3]` must be less than or equal to `arr[2]`, the updated value of `ans[3]` will still satisfy this condition because it is exactly `arr[2] + ans[2]`. All other elements in `ans` and `arr` remain unchanged.
