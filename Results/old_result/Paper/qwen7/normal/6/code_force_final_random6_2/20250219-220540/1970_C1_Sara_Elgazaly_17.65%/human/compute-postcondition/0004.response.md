Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `y` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, and both are integers; `lst[a]` now includes `b`.**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list located at index `a` in the list `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
