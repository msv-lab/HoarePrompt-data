Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Game Logic Implementation**: The problem involves two players taking turns to modify the arrays `a` and `c`, and the goal is to determine the MEX of `c` at the end. However, the provided code does not simulate these turns or construct the array `c` based on the game rules. Instead, it simply counts the frequency of elements in the input array `arr` and prints the first unique element within the range `[0, n)`.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation is not performed correctly. The program does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob and how they affect the contents of `c`.

3. **Output**: The output of the provided code does not match the expected output for the given examples. For instance, in the first test case, the expected MEX is 2, but the code might print something different based on the unique elements found in the input array.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
