Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, if `t` (which is implied to be part of the test case) satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the function evaluates `x` and `y` (where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) and returns a result based on these values.**

However, since the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given output cases, the functionality can be described as processing test cases with `t`, `x`, and `y` and returning a result based on their values within the specified ranges.
