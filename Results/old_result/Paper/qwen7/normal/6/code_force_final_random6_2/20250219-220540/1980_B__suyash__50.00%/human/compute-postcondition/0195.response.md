Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `k` is decreased by `dic[l[3]]`.
- `k` is less than or equal to 0.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print('MAYBE')` is executed.

From the initial state, we know that `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[3]]`. Since `i` is 3, it implies that `l[3]` refers to the fourth element in the list `l`. However, the exact value of `dic[l[3]]` is not provided, but we know that after this operation, `k` becomes less than or equal to 0.

Given that the print statement is simply `print('MAYBE')`, it will print the string `'MAYBE'`.

Output: **MAYBE**
