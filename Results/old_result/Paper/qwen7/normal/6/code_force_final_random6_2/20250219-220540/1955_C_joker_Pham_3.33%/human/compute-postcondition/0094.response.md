Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` must be equal to `n`, `r` must be `n - 2`, `sunks` is either 3 or 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if and else parts, indicating that regardless of whether the condition `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` is true or false, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain the same constraints and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
