Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for finding the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \). 

The main issues are in the following functions:

1. **Tree Structure**: The `Tree` class is not defined in the provided code snippet. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` assume the existence of a `Tree` class with specific attributes and methods (`children`, `good_components`, `remaining_size`, etc.), which are not implemented. Without these, the functions cannot operate correctly.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1` and `func_2`**: These functions seem to be attempting to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and remaining sizes. However, the logic is flawed. For instance, the `func_1` function uses a post-order traversal but incorrectly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size`. The `func_2` function also has similar issues.

3. **Binary Search Implementation in `func_4`**: The binary search implementation in `func_4` is intended to find the maximum \( x \). However, the conditions within `func_3` are not correctly checking whether the removal of edges can achieve the desired component sizes. Specifically, the `func_3` function does not correctly handle the edge removal logic and the component size constraints.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
