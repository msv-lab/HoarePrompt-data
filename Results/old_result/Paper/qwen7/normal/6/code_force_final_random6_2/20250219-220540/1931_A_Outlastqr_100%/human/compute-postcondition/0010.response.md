Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer greater than 27, `word` is the string 'az', and `alphabet[n - 28]` is concatenated to `word`.**

Explanation: The code appends the characters 'a', the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28`, and 'z' to the `word` string. Since `n` is greater than 27, `n - 28` is a non-negative integer. However, the exact character from `alphabet` is not specified, so it is represented as `alphabet[n - 28]`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `word` is updated to include 'a', the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 28`, and 'z'.
