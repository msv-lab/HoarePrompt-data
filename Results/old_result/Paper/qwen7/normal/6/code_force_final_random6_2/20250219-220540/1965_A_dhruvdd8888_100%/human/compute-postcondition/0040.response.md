Output State: `cw` is `True`, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is 0, `nw` is `True`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `len(nums) - 2` down to `1`. After each iteration, `i` decreases by 1. Since the loop continues until `i` is 0 (inclusive), it will run exactly `len(nums) - 1` times if `nums` has more than one element. Given that the loop has executed three times, `i` is now `len(nums) - 4`. The loop will continue to decrement `i` until it reaches 0. At that point, `cw` will be set to `True` on the last iteration because the condition `nums[i] == 1` will no longer be checked (as `i` is 0, which is less than the start of the range). Therefore, `cw` remains `True`, `i` becomes 0, and the other variables (`ls`, `nums`, and `nw`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
