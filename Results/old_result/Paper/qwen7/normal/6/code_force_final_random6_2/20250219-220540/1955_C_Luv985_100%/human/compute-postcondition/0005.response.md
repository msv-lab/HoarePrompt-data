Output State: **`T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq T \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n` is an integer converted from the first word of the input split by space; `k` is the second word of the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(n)` converts the string `n` into an integer. Since `n` was originally the first word of the input split by space, it now holds an integer value. The variable `k` remains unchanged as it was the second word of the input split by space. The value of `T` remains the same as it was not affected by the code snippet.
