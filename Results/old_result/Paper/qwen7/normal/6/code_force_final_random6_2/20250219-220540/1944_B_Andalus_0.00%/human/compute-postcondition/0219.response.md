Output State: **`ldb` must contain at least one element, the size of `ldb` (denoted as `sz`) is now greater than or equal to `k` + 2, and `k - sz` is now less than or equal to -2.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` was incremented by 2, making it `sz + 2`. Given the initial conditions, `sz` was originally at least `k`, and now it is at least `k + 2`. Additionally, since `sz` was already at least `k` and we added 2 to it, the condition `k - sz` is now reduced by 2, making it `k - (sz + 2)` which is now less than or equal to -2. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
