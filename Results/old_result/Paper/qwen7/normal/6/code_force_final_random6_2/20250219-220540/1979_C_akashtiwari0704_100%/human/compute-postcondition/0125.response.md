Output State: **`i` is `bets + 1`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 10, `ans` includes the string representation of `a[i-1]`, followed by a space, then the string representation of `a[i]`, followed by a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to `ans`. Given that `i` is `bets + 1`, the value of `i` remains unchanged, and `bets` must be greater than or equal to 10. The string `ans` now includes the string representation of `a[i-1]` (which was included before this line) and the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.
