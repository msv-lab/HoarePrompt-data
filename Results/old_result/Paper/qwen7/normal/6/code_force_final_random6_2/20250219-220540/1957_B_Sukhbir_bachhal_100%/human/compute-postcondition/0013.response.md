Output State: `position` is 5, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).

Explanation: The loop continues to right-shift `n` by 1 bit and increment `position` until `n` becomes 0. After the loop executes 3 times, `n` is already 0, which means it will not execute any further iterations. Therefore, `position` will be incremented one more time (from 4 to 5) before the loop terminates. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
