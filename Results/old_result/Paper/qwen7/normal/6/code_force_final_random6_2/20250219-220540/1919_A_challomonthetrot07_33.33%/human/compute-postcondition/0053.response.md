Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
