Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being `lit[i]`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `a.append(lit[1])` is executed. This means the last element of `a` is now `lit[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
