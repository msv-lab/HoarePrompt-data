Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, `num_iterations` must be greater than 0, `a` is reassigned to an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, reassigning the value to `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
