Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to simulate the process of the Kraken attacking the ships. Here's a breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the number of test cases `T` and iterates through each test case.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durability of each ship `nums`.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It converts the list `nums` into a deque for efficient popping from both ends.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.
   - It enters a loop where it continues processing as long as there are at least two ships left and `k` is greater than zero.
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements of the deque (`a` and `b` respectively), calculates the minimum of these two values (`x`), and reduces both `a` and `b` by `x`.
   - It decrements `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If the first ship (`a`) is still alive, it is pushed back to the front of the deque.
   - If the last ship (`b`) is still alive, it is appended to the end of the deque.
   - If either ship is sunk (`a` or `b` is zero or negative), it increments the `ans` counter.
   - After the loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is sufficient to sink it, it increments `ans` by one.
   - Finally, it returns the total count of sunk ships.

Given the provided example and the execution summary, the logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the described process. The function handles the reduction of ship durability and counting the number of sunk ships accurately according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
