You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

        a = int(a)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.

    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b * 2
        
        if t % 5 == 0:

            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: The final value of `t` after all iterations of the loop is determined by the last input values of `a` and `b`, and the operations performed within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a value `t` based on the given inputs and certain conditions. Specifically, it first doubles `b` and adjusts `t` based on whether the doubled value is divisible by 5. Then, it checks if `t` multiplied by 15 minus `b` times 4 is greater than or equal to `a`. If not, it calculates the difference and further adjusts `t` accordingly. Finally, it prints the resulting value of `t` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Specifically, the logic for calculating `t` and `t1` is flawed. Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input `12 4`. According to the problem description, we need to place 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2. Each screen can hold up to 15 icons (5x3 grid).

Let's manually calculate the minimum number of screens needed:
- 4 icons of size 2x2 occupy 4 * 4 = 16 cells, which can fit into 2 screens (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells).
- We need to place 12 icons of size 1x1, and since each screen can hold up to 15 - 4 = 11 cells from the 2x2 icons, we need an additional 1 screen to place the remaining 12 icons.

So, the total number of screens needed is 2 + 1 = 3.

However, the program outputs 2 for this input, which is incorrect. This shows that the program does not correctly handle the placement of icons of different sizes and the calculation of the minimum number of screens.
