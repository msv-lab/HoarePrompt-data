Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is -1
   - `n` is 2
   - `y[i]` is `k`
   - `q1` is 1
   - `q2` is unchanged (meaning its value remains the same as before the loop)

2. **Loop Definition:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i = n - 2` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` is -1.
   - Given `n` is 2, the initial value of `i` would be `2 - 2 = 0`.
   - The loop runs as follows:
     - First iteration: `i = 0`
     - Second iteration: `i = -1` (the loop stops here because `i` is already -1).

4. **Current State:**
   - Since the loop has just finished, `i` is -1 (as given in the initial state).
   - `n` remains 2.
   - `y[i]` is still `k` because `i` is -1 and the value of `y[-1]` hasn't changed.
   - `q1` is 1 and `q2` is unchanged.

5. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will not execute again because `i` is already -1 and the loop condition `i >= -1` is no longer satisfied.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed for `i`, `n`, `y[i]`, `q1`, or `q2`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is -1
   - `n` is 2
   - `y[i]` is `k`
   - `q1` is 1
   - `q2` is unchanged

**State: **`i` is -1, `n` is 2, `y[i]` is `k`, `q1` is 1, `q2` is unchanged**
