### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a`.
- Alice appends the chosen element to array `c` and removes it from `a`.
- Bob only removes the chosen element from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score is the MEX of `c`.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using a `defaultdict`.
- It then iterates through the elements and prints the first index `i` where either `cnt[i] == 0` or `cnt[i] == 1`.
- This approach does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described in the problem.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It counts the number of unique elements that appear exactly once in the array.
- If there are at least two such elements or if an element does not appear at all, it prints the index of the first such element and breaks the loop.
- If no such element is found, it prints the length of the array.
- The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program does not simulate the game's turns correctly. It does not account for the fact that Alice appends elements to `c` and Bob only removes elements from `a`.
- The function summary describes a different logic than what is required by the problem. It does not reflect the game's turns and the optimal strategy for both players.
- The provided examples show that the program's output is incorrect because it does not follow the game's rules.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the game rules and calculate the MEX of the array `c`.

### Final:
**False**
