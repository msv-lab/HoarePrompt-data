Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 5`, `st` is `n - 3`, `end` is increased by 1 and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must hold true**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 4`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 5`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
