The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It prints pairs of identical elements from the list until a specified number of unique elements (k) have been printed. Any remaining unique elements are printed individually at the end. The function ensures that each element from the list appears exactly twice in the output.
