Output State: **`sz` is 7, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, and the first element in the list is the original `elem`.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 6 to 7. The values of `k` and `sng` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet. The condition `sz >= k` is still true, and since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition regarding `sng`.
