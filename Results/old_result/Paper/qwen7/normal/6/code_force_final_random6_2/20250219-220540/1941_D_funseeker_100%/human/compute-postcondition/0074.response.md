Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element less than before, `temp` now contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and `c` is either '0' or '?'**

Explanation: The code adds `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. This means that the set `temp` now includes the new element `(q + r) % n`, along with the existing element `(q - r) % n`. The variable `ans` has lost at least one element, but its exact content is not specified. The variable `c` remains unchanged and is either '0' or '?'.
