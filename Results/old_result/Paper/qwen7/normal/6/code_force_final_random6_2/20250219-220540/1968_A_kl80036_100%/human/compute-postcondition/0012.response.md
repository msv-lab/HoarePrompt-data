Output State: The loop will execute as many times as the user inputs. For each iteration, `i` will take on the value of the current iteration index (ranging from 0 up to the total number of inputs minus one), `x` will be an integer input between 1 and 1000, and `y` will be `x - 1`. After all iterations, the final value of `i` will be the total number of inputs received, and `x` and `y` will reflect the last input and its corresponding `x - 1`, respectively.

To summarize, if the user inputs `n` integers, then after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, `x` will be the last input integer, and `y` will be the last input integer minus one.
