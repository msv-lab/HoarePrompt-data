The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, but since it is a dummy variable, it does not affect the loop's execution. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` was incremented by 1, `n` was reduced by 1, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is now at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute again as long as `t` remains greater than 0.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is still greater than 0, and the other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is reduced by 1, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**
