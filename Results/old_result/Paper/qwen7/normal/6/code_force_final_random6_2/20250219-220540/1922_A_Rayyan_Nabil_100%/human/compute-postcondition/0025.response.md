Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `result` which is being iterated over from the `results` list.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop.
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration.
   - `result` is the first element in the `results` list.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the `results` list to iterate over. Once all elements are exhausted, the loop terminates.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `results`, the variable `result` will change to the next element in the list.
   - The other variables (`t`, `c`, `n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**: After the current iteration, `result` will be the next element in the `results` list. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `result` as the second element in the `results` list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration, `result` is the second element in the `results` list, `t` must be greater than 0**
