Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after these operations.

2. **Analyzing Function `func_2`**:
   - This function identifies the segment with the maximum sum in the array.
   - It handles both positive and negative contributions and considers the sum of the entire array as a potential segment.
   - The function returns the segment with the maximum starting point, which is crucial for determining the optimal insertion points for the new sums.

3. **Analyzing Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the remainder of the input number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is necessary because the result can be very large, and we need to output the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Analyzing the Main Logic**:
   - The main logic calculates the maximum segment sum using `func_2`.
   - If the maximum segment sum is negative, it sets it to 0.
   - It then calculates the new sum of the array after `k` operations by multiplying the maximum segment sum by \(2^k\) and adding the sum of the original array minus the maximum segment sum.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` to get the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the segment with the maximum sum.
   - The calculation of the new sum after `k` operations is accurate.
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
