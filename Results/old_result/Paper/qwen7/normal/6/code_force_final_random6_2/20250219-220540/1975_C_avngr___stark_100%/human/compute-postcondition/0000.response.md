Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer value of the input received.**

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user, while the other conditions and constraints remain unchanged. The variable `n` and the array `a` are not yet defined and will be initialized later based on further inputs.
