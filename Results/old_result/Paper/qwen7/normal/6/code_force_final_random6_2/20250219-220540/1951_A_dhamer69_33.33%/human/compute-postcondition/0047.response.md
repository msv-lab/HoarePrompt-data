Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `n` equals 2 and `s` is not '00', `count_1` remains unchanged. If `n` does not equal 2, `count_1` remains unchanged regardless of the value of `s`.
