Postcondition: **`i` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `n` is an integer, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `y[-1]` is equal to `k`, and `k` is updated as follows: if `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is increased by 1; otherwise, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m` and the first element of `t` is not 'R'.**
