Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `ind` is `ind - 2`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(0, n, 2):`
   - This means `i` starts from 0 and increments by 2 each time until it reaches or exceeds `n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2, making `i` equal to 3.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` was 1 in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 3 and `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` needs to be set to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.
   - `ind` is not directly involved in the loop condition but is updated by `ind - 2` in the loop body. We don't need to change its value here since it's not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ind` is `ind - 2`**
