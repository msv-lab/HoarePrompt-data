Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is `n + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `end` was already increased by 1 in the initial state, so the code `end += 1` increments `end` by 1 again, making its value `n + 1`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `st` remain unchanged from their initial values.
