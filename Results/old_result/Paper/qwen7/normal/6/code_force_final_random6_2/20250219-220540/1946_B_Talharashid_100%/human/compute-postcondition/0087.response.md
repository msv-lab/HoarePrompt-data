Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in l`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `l`. After each iteration, `ele` takes the next element from the list `l`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **List `l`**: Since `ele` is set to the next element in the list `l`, if there are still elements left in `l`, the list `l` should be adjusted to exclude the current `ele`.
   - **Variable `ele`**: `ele` will be set to the next element in the list `l` for the next iteration.

4. **Postconditions**:
   - `maxi` is updated based on certain conditions involving `c` and `ele`.
   - `c` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it is not adjusted here.
   - The postcondition does not affect the list `l` directly but rather the value of `maxi` based on the current `ele`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `ele` will be set to the next element in `l`, we need to ensure that `l` has at least one more element.
   - `maxi` might remain unchanged or be updated, but this is not part of the loop head adjustment.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `l` must have at least one more element (since `ele` will take the next element).
- `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements (one less than before), `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**.
