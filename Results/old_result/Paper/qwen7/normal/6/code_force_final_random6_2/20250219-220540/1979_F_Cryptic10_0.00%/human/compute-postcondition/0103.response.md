Postcondition: `d` is `n-1`, `v` is either no longer in `remaining_vertices` or remains in `remaining_vertices` as per the original condition, and `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n-1)`. If `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, the variables `d`, `v`, and `u` are updated accordingly and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
