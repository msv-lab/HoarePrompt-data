Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 49.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

The `print(s)` statement will print the string `s`, which is constructed by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times.

Since `n` is an input integer, we don't have a specific value for it, but we know that `s` will be composed of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

Therefore, the output will be a string made up of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

Output: **'AAB' repeated n // 2 times**
