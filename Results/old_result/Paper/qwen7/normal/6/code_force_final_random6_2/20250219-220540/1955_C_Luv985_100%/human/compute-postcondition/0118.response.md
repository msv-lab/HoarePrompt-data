Output State: **Postcondition: `ans` is 1, `T` is False, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, and the value of `a[l]` is equal to `t + k // 2`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
