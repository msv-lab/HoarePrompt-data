Output State: **`i` is 100001, `s` is `s` + `c` * `100000` * `c` * `m` + `c` * `a` + `c` * `100001` * `c` * `m` + `c` * `a`**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 100001. The variable `s` is updated by adding the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Since the initial value of `s` is given as `s` + `c` * `100000` * `c` * `m` + `c` * `a`, the new value of `s` becomes the sum of the original `s` and the additional terms `c * 100001 * c * m + c * a`.
