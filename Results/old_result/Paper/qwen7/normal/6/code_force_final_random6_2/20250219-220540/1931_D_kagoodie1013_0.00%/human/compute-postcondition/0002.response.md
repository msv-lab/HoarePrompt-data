Output State: **`count` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. The values of `test_cases` and `results` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `count` is now 0, while `test_cases` and `results` retain their original structures and contents.
