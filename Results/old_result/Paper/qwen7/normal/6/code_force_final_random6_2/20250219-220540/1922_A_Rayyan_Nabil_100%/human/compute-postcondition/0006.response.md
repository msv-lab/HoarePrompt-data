Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code assigns the stripped input string to the variable `c`. The variable `results` remains an empty list as no operation was performed on it. The value of `b` is not used in the given code snippet, so it is not affected.
