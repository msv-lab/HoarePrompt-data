Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `cnt` is undefined, `ans` is `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. However, since `cnt` is undefined, its value remains unchanged, and `v[i]` is `v[n + 1]` because `i` is `n + 1`. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is `ans + cnt * v[n + 1] * (v[n + 1] - 1) // 2`. The variable `i` retains its value of `n + 1`, and `cnt` remains undefined.
