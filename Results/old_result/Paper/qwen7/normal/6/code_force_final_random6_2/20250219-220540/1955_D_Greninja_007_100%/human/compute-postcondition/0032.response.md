Output State: **`ans` is 1, `sm` is `sm - 1`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `r` is `m + 1`, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1, and `ca[a[r]]` has been incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ca[a[r - m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `ca[a[r - m]]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `sm` is decreased by 1 due to the decrement operation, and `ca[a[r - m]]` is updated accordingly.
