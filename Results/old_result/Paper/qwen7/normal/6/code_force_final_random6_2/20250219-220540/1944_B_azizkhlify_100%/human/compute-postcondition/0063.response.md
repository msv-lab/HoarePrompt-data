Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `re` is equal to `k`. The variable `res` is a list containing either the elements `a[0]` and `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, or it remains unchanged as a list containing the element `a[0]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 1.
