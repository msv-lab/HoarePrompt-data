Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book for each test case, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of books, along with a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book. The function returns the sum of pages for each test case.**
