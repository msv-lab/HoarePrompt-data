Output State: The `stack` contains a series of tuples `(u, False)` where each `u` is a successive child vertex from `tree.vertices[v].children`. The exact number of tuples depends on the total number of children of `v` in the tree.

In more detail, the `stack` will contain a list of all child vertices of `v` from `tree.vertices[v].children`, each paired with `False` as the second element. The order of these tuples in the stack will correspond to the order in which the children were processed during the loop iterations.
