Output State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is the size of `ldb` plus 2, and `k - sz >= 2`**.

Explanation: The code `sz += 2` increments the value of `sz` by 2. Since `sz` was initially the size of `ldb`, after executing this line, `sz` will be the size of `ldb` plus 2. The conditions that `ldb` contains at least one element and `k - sz >= 2` remain unchanged.
