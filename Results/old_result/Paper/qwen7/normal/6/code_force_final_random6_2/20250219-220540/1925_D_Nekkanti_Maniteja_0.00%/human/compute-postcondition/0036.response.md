Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 100000
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000
   - `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation
   - `a` is `a` plus `f`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 100000, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 100001.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `u`, `v`, and `f` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain the same.
   - `a` is updated by adding `f` to its current value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 100001, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation, `a` is `a` plus `f`**
