Postcondition: `sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[2]`, `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`, and `i` is 2. If the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, then the element `lft[2]` is added to `sng`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.
