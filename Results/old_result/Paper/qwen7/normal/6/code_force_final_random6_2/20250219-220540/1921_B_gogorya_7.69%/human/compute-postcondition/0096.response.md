Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `hd` is `hd - 1`, `s1` and `s2` are strings, and `res` remains unchanged.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the variables `i`, `n`, `hd`, `s1`, `s2`, and `res` remain unchanged.
