Reasoning:
1. The provided program has a main loop that iterates over each test case, correctly reading the size of the array and the array itself.
2. The `func_1` function aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. However, the logic implemented in `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem as described.
3. The current implementation of `func_1` checks for consecutive equal elements starting from both ends of the array and calculates the cost based on the distance between these elements. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of making all elements equal through a single operation where the entire segment between two different elements is set to the same value.
4. The provided execution summary describes the function incorrectly. The function does not return `-1` in any scenario, and it does not handle the case where the entire array needs to be changed to a single value.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
