Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the values based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the problem does not specify any change to `n` within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains as either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to either `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + (a - b * 28 + (b * 2 // 5) * 15 - b * 4) // 15` or `b * 2 // 5 + (b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`.**
