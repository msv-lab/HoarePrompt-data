Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split, `h` is the second integer from the input split, `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `x` as the sum of the squares of the differences between `c` and `g`, and `d` and `h`. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
