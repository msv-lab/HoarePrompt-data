Output State: `i` is 16, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (0 - 1)), -1, (1 << 0), ... , -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)], `c` is 16, `k0` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is non-zero. Since `k` starts as 1 and is halved each iteration, it will take 16 iterations to reach 0. Each iteration appends the current value of `i` to `arr` and increments `i` by 1. After 16 iterations, `i` will be 16, and `arr` will contain the values [0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
