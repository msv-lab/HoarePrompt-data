Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins across different outcomes in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The annotated program attempts to solve this by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the multipliers and using it to scale down the bets.

2. **Key Steps in the Program**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`).
   - It then computes the scaled-down bets by dividing `m` by each multiplier `k_i`.
   - The GCD of these scaled-down bets is calculated using the `func_1` function.
   - Finally, the program checks if the sum of the scaled-down bets is less than the scaled-down product `m / hcf`. If true, it prints the scaled-down bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Analysis of the Program**:
   - **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the GCD of the list of numbers passed to it.
   - **Scaling Down Bets**: The bets are scaled down by dividing `m` by each `k_i`, which ensures that the bets are proportional to the multipliers.
   - **Sum Check**: The check `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. If the condition fails, `-1` is printed, indicating no valid distribution exists.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the sum of the scaled-down bets is not less than the scaled-down product `m / hcf` by printing `-1`.
   - The program correctly scales down the bets to ensure they are within the required range (1 to \(10^9\)).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program logic aligns with the problem requirements and correctly implements the solution strategy.
   - The use of GCD ensures that the bets are proportionally distributed and the sum check ensures the condition is met.

Correctness: **True**
