Postcondition: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`. If `v` equals 0, then the condition holds as stated. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if `v` does not equal 0.**
