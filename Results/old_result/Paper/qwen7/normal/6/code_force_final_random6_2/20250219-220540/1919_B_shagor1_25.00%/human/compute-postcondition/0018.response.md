To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
   - `i` is the last character in the string `s`.
   - `neg` is the total count of '-' characters in the string `s`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be a variable that exists in the scope where this code is executed.
- `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`.

Given the expression inside the `print` statement:
- If `n != neg`, then the expression evaluates to `n - 2 * neg`.
- If `n == neg`, then the expression evaluates to `n`.

Since `n` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can still express the output based on the relationship between `n` and `neg`.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `n` relative to `neg`:
- If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the output will be `n - 2 * neg`.
- If `n` is equal to `neg`, the output will be `n`.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is a variable and neg is the count of '-' characters in the string s)**
