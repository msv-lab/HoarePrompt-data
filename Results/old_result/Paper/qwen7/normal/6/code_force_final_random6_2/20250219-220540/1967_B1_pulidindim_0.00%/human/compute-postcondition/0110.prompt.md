Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the precondition that the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 â‹… 10^6 remains valid.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 2
    ans = n
    while count <= m:
        countmins = count - 1
        g = n / count
        if g < countmins:
            break
        g -= countmins
        ans += g / count + 1
        count += 1
    print(int(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is at least 5, `count` is 6, `ans` is equal to `n` + `n` / 4 / 2 - 1 / 4 + (`n` / 4 - 1) / 4 + 1 + `g` / 5 + 1, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `n` / 5 - 1.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop continues until `count` exceeds `m`. After 3 iterations, `count` is 5. For the loop to complete all iterations, `m` must be at least 5. In the final iteration, `count` becomes 6. The value of `ans` accumulates based on the formula provided in each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series `n / 2 - 3 / 3 + 1`, `((n / 3) - 1) / 3 + 1`, ..., `((n / m) - 1) / m + 1`, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `n / m - m - 1`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `count` will be equal to `m + 1`. The variable `ans` will be updated in each iteration by adding the value of `g / count + 1` where `g` is adjusted in each iteration, and `countmins` is set to `count - 1` in each iteration. The series of additions to `ans` follows the pattern described, with the last term being `((n / m) - 1) / m + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - 4) / 4 + 2 + (n / 5 - 6) / 5 + 3 + ... + (n / k - (k-2)) / k + (k-1)`, where `k` is the largest integer such that `k <= m`, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, and `g` is `n / k - (k-2)`.

This output state describes the final value of `ans` after the loop has executed as many times as possible without breaking, with `m` being the upper limit of the loop. The value of `ans` is calculated by summing up the contributions from each iteration of the loop, where each contribution depends on the current value of `count`. The loop continues until `count` exceeds `m`, at which point it breaks.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
