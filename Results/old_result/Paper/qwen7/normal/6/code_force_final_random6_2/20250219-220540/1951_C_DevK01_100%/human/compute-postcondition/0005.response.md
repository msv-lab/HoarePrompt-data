Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`.**

Explanation: The code `m = min(m, k)` updates the value of `m` to be the minimum value between the current value of `m` (which is the second element of `L`) and `k` (which is the third element of `L`). All other variables remain unchanged.
