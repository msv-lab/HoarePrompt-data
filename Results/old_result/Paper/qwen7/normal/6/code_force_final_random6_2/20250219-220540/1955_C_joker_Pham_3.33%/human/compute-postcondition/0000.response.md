Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9, where the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 1`.**

The code initializes two new variables, `l` and `r`, with values `0` and `n - 1` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
