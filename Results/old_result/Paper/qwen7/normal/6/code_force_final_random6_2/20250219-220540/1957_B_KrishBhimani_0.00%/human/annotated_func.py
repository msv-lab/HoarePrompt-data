#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It then constructs a list \( ans \) based on the binary representation of \( k \). The list \( ans \) contains powers of 2 corresponding to the bits set in \( k \), followed by zeros to ensure the list has a total length of \( n \). Finally, it prints the constructed list for each test case.
