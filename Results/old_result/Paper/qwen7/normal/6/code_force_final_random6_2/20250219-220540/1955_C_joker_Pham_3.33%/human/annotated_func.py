    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2] - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]\) or \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `n - 3` or `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 4` or `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the variable `t` remains a positive integer as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `n` also remains unchanged, being a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\). The variable `k` takes on a specific form based on the operations performed within the loop, which results in a negative value involving multiples of elements from the list `a`. The variable `a` itself remains a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with a length of `n`. The indices `l` and `r` are set to `n - 3` or `n - 1` and `n - 4` or `n - 3`, respectively, indicating the positions in the list `a` that were last processed. Finally, the variable `sunks` indicates the total number of successful operations (or "sunks") performed during the loop, which ranges between 4 and 10 inclusive, depending on the exact sequence of operations and the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns a value for `sunks` which is either 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\)), and `a` (a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`). It processes the list `a` by performing operations based on the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` within a while loop. The function counts the number of successful operations (referred to as `sunks`) and returns this count, which can be one of the values 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.
