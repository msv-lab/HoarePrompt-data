Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in arr`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one of the elements in `arr`, and `arr` is a list containing the values from 0 to 31.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is an element of `arr`. Since `arr` contains all integers from 0 to 31, `i` will take each value in this range sequentially.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` was one of the elements in `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be the next integer in the sequence of `arr`.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will now be the next integer in the list `arr`.

Given that `i` was one of the elements in `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be the next integer in the sequence. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can denote the next value of `i` as `i + 1`.

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]**
