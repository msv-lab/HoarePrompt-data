Output State: **`ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. All the initial conditions remain unchanged.
