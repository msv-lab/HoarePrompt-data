Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[0]`, `b` is equal to `l[0]` or `l[2]`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether `l[0]` or `l[2]` is less than or equal to positive infinity, and `x` is 2. If `l[x]` (which is `l[2]`) is less than or equal to `b` (which is `l[0]`), then `b` remains unchanged and `c` remains as it is. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[2]` and `c` is incremented by 1.
