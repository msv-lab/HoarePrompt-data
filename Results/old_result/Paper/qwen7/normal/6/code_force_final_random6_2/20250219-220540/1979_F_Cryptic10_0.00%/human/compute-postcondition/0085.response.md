Output State: **`d` is -1, `v` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`**.

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `d`, which is `-1`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `v` and `u` respectively. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we can only say that `v` and `u` are the second return values of `func_1(-1)`. The value of `d` remains `-1`, and `v` and `u` are updated with the return values of the function call. The state of `remaining_vertices` is not mentioned in the initial state and is not affected by the code, so it is not included in the output state.
