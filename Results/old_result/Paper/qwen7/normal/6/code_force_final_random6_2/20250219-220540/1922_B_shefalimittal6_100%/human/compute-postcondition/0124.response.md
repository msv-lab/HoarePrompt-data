Output State: **The loop has executed `n` times; `idx` is increased by `n`; `v[x]` is incremented `n` times for each `x` which is an integer from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`; `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `idx` or the increments applied to elements in `v`. Therefore, `idx` remains `3 + n` and each element in `v` is incremented `n` times for each `x` which is an integer from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`. The only new information is that `cnt` is now 0.
