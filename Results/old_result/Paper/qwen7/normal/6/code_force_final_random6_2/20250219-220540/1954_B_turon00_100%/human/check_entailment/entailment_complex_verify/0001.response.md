### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and sets `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - When an element is different from `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final value of `cnt`.
   - If the array has only one element or all elements are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic correctly identifies sequences of consecutive identical elements.
   - However, the logic does not account for the possibility of removing elements to break the beauty condition.
   - The code only counts consecutive identical elements and does not consider the possibility of breaking the sequence by removing elements.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The given code does not solve the problem correctly. It only counts consecutive identical elements and does not provide the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
   - The code fails to handle the requirement of finding the minimum number of removals to make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the process of counting consecutive identical elements but does not reflect the necessary logic to find the minimum number of removals.
   - The annotated code states that the variable `ans` holds the final result for each input list `a`, which is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution. This is misleading because `cnt` is only used to count consecutive identical elements, not to determine the minimum number of removals.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. It only counts consecutive identical elements and does not provide the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. It only counts consecutive identical elements and does not provide the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
