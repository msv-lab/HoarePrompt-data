Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The values of `start`, `end`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
