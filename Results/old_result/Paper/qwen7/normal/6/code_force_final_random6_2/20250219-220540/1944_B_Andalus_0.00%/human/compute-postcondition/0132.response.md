Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains at least one less element than before, `sz` is 9, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, making it 9 since it was initially either 5 or 7. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
