Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, `k` is equal to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `res` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `res -= 1` decreases the value of `res` by 1. The values of `i`, `dif`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `res` by 1 while keeping the other variables in their original form.
