Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The conditions for updating `ans` and the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still less than `n`, `n` remains an input integer, `tmp` retains its original value, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`.
