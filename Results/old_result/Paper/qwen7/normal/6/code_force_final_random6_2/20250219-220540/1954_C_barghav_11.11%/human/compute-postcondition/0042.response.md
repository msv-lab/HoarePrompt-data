Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list.
- `b` is a list.
- Both `a` and `b` must be of the same length.
- `i` is 0.

The `print(a[i], end='')` statement will print the element at index 0 of the list `a`.

Since the exact elements of `a` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `a` and the index `i`.

Output: **[element at index 0 of list a]**
