Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), and `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` (which is the last element of list `a`) is equal to `y`, then `i` remains 0, `n` remains greater than 0, `a` remains as it is, and `y` remains the same. If `x` is equal to `y` and `x` is the last element of list `a`, `a` may change to a non-empty list with the last element equal to `lit[0]` and `x` becomes `lit[0]`. If `x` is equal to `y` and `x` is the last element of list `a`, and `lit[0]` is less than `y`, then `lit[0]` is appended to list `b`. If `x` is less than `y`, then `a` remains unchanged and `x` is still the last element of list `a`. If `x` is less than `y` and `x` is the last element of list `a`, and `lit[0]` is less than `y`, then `lit[0]` is appended to list `b`.
