Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables and objects involved in the loop head:
   - The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, which is a common practice when the value of the iterator is not needed within the loop body.
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations.

2. Determine which states need to be adjusted:
   - The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run. Since the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, `t` must be a positive integer.
   - The variable `numbers` is a list, but since the loop does not modify the list directly (it only iterates over `range(t)`), the state of `numbers` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

3. Formulate the required state:
   - The only variable that affects the loop's execution is `t`. Therefore, `t` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`t` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**
