Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n`, otherwise `res` is `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (inclusive) minus 1.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop runs `t` times.
- The loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any meaningful value within the loop itself.
- The only state that changes with each iteration of the loop is `t`. Since `t` is decremented by 1 with each iteration, it will eventually reach 0 and the loop will stop.

### Adjusting States
- `res`: This is determined by the values of `k` and `n` and does not change within the loop.
- `t`: This is the only variable that changes with each iteration. It starts as an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (inclusive) minus 1 and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0.
- `n` and `k`: These are input integers and do not change within the loop.

### New State After One Iteration
After one iteration of the loop, `t` will be decreased by 1.

### Final Answer
State: **`res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n`, otherwise `res` is `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (inclusive) minus 2, `n` and `k` are input integers.**
