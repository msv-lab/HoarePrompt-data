Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code converts the variable `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) into its binary representation using the `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace()` method. The resulting binary string is stored in the variable `l`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
