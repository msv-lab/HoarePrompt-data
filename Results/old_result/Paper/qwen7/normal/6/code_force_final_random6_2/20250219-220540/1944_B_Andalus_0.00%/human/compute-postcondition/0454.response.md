Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **`elem`**: This variable is initialized to each element of `sng` in each iteration. Since it is an internal loop variable, its initial value at the start of the loop is not directly adjustable.
   - **`sng`**: This is the collection from which elements are being iterated over. For the loop to continue, `sng` must contain at least one element.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is either 1 or 3.
   - `rdb` is empty.
   - `sng` contains at least one element.
   - If the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks.

4. **Conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `sng` contains at least one element. There are no other conditions specified in the loop head that would affect the continuation of the loop.

5. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since `sng` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, and there are no changes to `sng` within the loop body (as per the given information), `sng` should still contain at least one element at the start of the next iteration.
   - The values of `sz` and `rdb` are not directly affected by the loop head and thus do not need adjustment based on the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains:
- `sz` is either 1 or 3.
- `rdb` is empty.
- `sng` contains at least one element.

State: **`sz` is either 1 or 3, `rdb` is empty, `sng` contains at least one element**
