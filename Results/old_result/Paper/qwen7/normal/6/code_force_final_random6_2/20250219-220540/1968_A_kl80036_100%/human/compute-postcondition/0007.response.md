Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`.

When the `print(y)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Output: **x - 1 (where x is an input integer between 1 and 1000)**
