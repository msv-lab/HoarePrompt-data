Output State: **`i` is n-1, `dif` is a[n] - a[n-1], `k` is 0, `ans` is ans * (n - 1) - n, `res` is -n, `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`.**

The code `ans_list.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_list`. Since no specific value was given for `ans` initially, it retains its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
