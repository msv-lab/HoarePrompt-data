Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= j`.
2. **Current states**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= j` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` is 0, and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.
   - Since `i` (0) is less than or equal to `j` (length of `arr` - 1), the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - No adjustments are necessary because the current values of `i` and `j` already satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0; `j` is the length of `arr` - 1**
