Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner based on whether the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd.
2. The logic in the provided code checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using `(a + b) & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.
3. This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for the game:
   - If the sum of coins is even, Bob will always win because he can force the sum to become odd after his turn, ensuring Alice eventually loses.
   - If the sum of coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can force the sum to become even after her turn, ensuring Bob eventually loses.
4. The code correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each one independently.
5. The provided examples and the logic in the annotated program confirm that the code behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
