### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem statement and the examples provided.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1.
   - A loop runs `x` times, where `s` is updated in each iteration.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - This formula seems to be an attempt to calculate how many coins Sasha can accumulate if he follows a specific betting strategy.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - The program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s` (calculated value).
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Examples Analysis**:
   - Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:
     - **Example 1**: `k=2`, `x=1`, `a=7`
       - `s` starts at 1.
       - After one iteration: `s += 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
       - Since `7 >= 3`, the output should be "Yes".
     - **Example 2**: `k=2`, `x=1`, `a=1`
       - `s` starts at 1.
       - After one iteration: `s += 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
       - Since `1 < 3`, the output should be "No".
     - **Example 3**: `k=2`, `x=3`, `a=15`
       - `s` starts at 1.
       - After three iterations: `s += 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, `s += 3 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`, `s += 6 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 6 + 3 + 1 = 10`.
       - Since `15 >= 10`, the output should be "Yes".
     - **Example 4**: `k=3`, `x=3`, `a=6`
       - `s` starts at 1.
       - After three iterations: `s += 1 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, `s += 3 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`, `s += 6 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 6 + 3 + 1 = 10`.
       - Since `6 < 10`, the output should be "No".

From the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve the desired number of coins based on the given constraints. 

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
