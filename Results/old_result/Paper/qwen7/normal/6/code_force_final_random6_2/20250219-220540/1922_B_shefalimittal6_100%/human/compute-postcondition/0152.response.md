Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, and `ans` is updated such that if `v[i] >= 3`, then `ans` is incremented by `(cnt + v[i]) * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i] < 3`, then `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by `v[i]`. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition for updating `ans` is based on the new value of `cnt`, which is now `cnt + v[i]`.
