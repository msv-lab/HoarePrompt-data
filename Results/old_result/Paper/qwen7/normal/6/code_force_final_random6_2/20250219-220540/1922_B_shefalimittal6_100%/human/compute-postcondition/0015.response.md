Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `x` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `x` is converted to an integer from `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `x = int(data[idx])` converts the value at index `idx` in the list `data` to an integer and assigns it to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
