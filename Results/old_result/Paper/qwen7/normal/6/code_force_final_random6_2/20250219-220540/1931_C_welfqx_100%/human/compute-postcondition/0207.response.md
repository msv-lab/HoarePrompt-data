Postcondition: **`ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `i` is 5, and if `num[i]` equals `num[i + 1]`, then we continue without breaking out of the loop. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
