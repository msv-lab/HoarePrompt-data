Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Typically, the variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 0 and `len(nums)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Initial State of `nums`**: The problem states that `nums` is a sorted list of integers converted from the original set of strings, and '0' is included. This means `nums` is not empty and contains at least one element (the integer 0).

5. **Adjusting the States**: Based on the above points, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 and `len(nums)` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State: **`ls` is 0, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that must include '0' and have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
