Output State: **`price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is updated to `min(m, k - tickets_bought) + tickets_to_buy`, `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`, `pq` remains a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index excluding the one just popped, `price` remains the price of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq` plus `price_increase`, `day` remains the index of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq`.**

This means that the `price_increase` variable has been incremented by the value of `tickets_to_buy`. The other variables (`tickets_bought`, `total_cost`, `pq`, `price`, and `day`) remain unchanged from their initial state, with `tickets_bought` being updated according to the given formula.
