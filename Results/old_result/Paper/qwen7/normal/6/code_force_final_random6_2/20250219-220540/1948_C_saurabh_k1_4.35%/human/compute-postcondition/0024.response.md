Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the last input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `n` is even, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the last input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the last input, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<', `a` remains unchanged.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be within its initial range, `n` will be the largest value it was set to during any iteration, `a` and `b` will contain the data from the last test case processed, and the condition `b[n-2] != '<'` will hold true as per the loop's logic.
