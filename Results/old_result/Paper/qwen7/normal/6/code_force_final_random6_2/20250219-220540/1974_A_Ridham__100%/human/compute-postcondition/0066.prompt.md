Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if extra_space % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and `result` now contains either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` depending on whether `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is appended with `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is calculated as `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` if `(space_x - remaining_cells)` is not divisible by 15, otherwise it is `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15`, and `result` now contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `2 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `7 * y + x + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2)` if `y` is even or `15 * (y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - 2 * y`, `result` contains either `screen_require_for_y` or a list containing one element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `4 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `8 * y + 2 * x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `result` is a list containing two elements which are `screen_require_for_y` and `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is either `extra_space // 15` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` based on whether `extra_space % 15 == 0` or not, and `result` now contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
