#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. The subsequent m lines contain integers r_i (1 <= r_i <= n - 1) and characters c_i ('0', '1', or '?'), where '0' indicates a clockwise throw, '1' indicates a counterclockwise throw, and '?' indicates an unknown direction.

    #The program reads a line of input from the standard input stream, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input from the standard input stream, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

For each of the m lines, r_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1, and c_i is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained from the function func_1(), which is not further defined in the given snippet.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calls another function `func_1()` and returns its result, which is an integer. This integer is derived from processing some input data involving test cases, where for each test case, it handles values of `n`, `m`, and `x` along with an array of pairs `(r_i, c_i)`. The exact nature of the processing within `func_1()` is not specified, but it transforms the input data into an integer output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. The list of moves contains m elements, where each element is a pair consisting of an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?') indicating the direction of the throw.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting a string returned by `func_1()` and converting each element to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by calling another function `func_1()`, which presumably returns a string. This string is then split into individual elements, and each element is converted to an integer, resulting in a list of integers being returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and ans is a set initialized with the player x. For each throw, r is an integer representing the distance of the throw (1 ≤ r ≤ n - 1), and c is a string representing the direction of the throw ('0', '1', or '?').

    n, m, x = func_3()

    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)

        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ans` will contain all possible players who could have the ball based on the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each iteration. The variable `temp` will hold the same set of values as `ans` since `ans` is updated to `temp` at the end of each iteration. The variable `r` will be an integer derived from the string `r` during each iteration, and `c` will be either '0', '1', or '?' determining which operation is performed. Given the conditions, after all iterations, every player will have had the ball at least once, assuming the function `func_1()` provides valid inputs for `r` and `c` such that all players are included in `ans`.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `ans` contains all possible players who could have the ball, including `n`. If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` is updated to include `n`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the length of the list ans after considering the condition)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: 0 n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts the number of players \( n \), the number of throws \( m \), the initial player \( x \), and a set \( ans \) initialized with player \( x \). For each throw, it updates the set \( ans \) based on the throw's distance \( r \) and direction \( c \). After all throws, it ensures that the set \( ans \) includes all players, and if player 0 is present, it replaces it with player \( n \). Finally, it prints the size of the set \( ans \) and the sorted list of players in \( ans \).
