The function `calculate_score` accepts a starting position `start_pos` and calculates a score based on the given permutation `p` and array `a`. It first traverses the permutation starting from `start_pos`, accumulating a score by summing the values in the array at the current positions. If a cycle is detected during this traversal, it adjusts the score by considering the sum of the cycle and the number of times the cycle repeats within the given duration `k`. The function ultimately returns the calculated score.
