Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input data and processes it according to the problem statement.
2. It initializes variables and iterates through the test cases, calculating the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle for each test case.
3. The logic for counting the number of valid triangles is correct:
   - For each stick length \(i\), if there are at least 2 sticks of length \(i\), it counts the combinations of choosing 2 out of those 2 sticks.
   - If there are at least 3 sticks of length \(i\), it counts the combinations of choosing 3 out of those 3 sticks.
4. The final result is stored in the `results` list, and the correct output format is produced by joining the results with newlines and printing them.

Given the provided code and the explanation, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
