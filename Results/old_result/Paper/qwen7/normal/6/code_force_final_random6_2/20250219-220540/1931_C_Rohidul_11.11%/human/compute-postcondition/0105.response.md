Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 4`, `st` is `n - 3`, `end` is increased by 1**

The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Since the initial state had `end` increased by 1, the final value of `end` is now increased by 2 compared to its initial state. All other variables (`l`, `r`, and `st`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
