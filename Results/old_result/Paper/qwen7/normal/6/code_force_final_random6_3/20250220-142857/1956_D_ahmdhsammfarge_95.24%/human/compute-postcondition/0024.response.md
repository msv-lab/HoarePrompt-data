Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`. The variables involved here are `j`, `i`, and `len(lst)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to 1.
   - `j` is currently set to `len(lst) - 1`.
   - `len(lst)` is a fixed value based on the length of the list `lst`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will start when `j` is in the range `(i + 1, len(lst))`.
   - Given `i = 1`, the loop will start when `j` is in the range `(2, len(lst))`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` is currently `len(lst) - 1`, we need to ensure that `j` is within the range `(2, len(lst))` for the loop to execute.
   - Therefore, `j` must be at least 2 for the loop to start executing.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `len(lst)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2 or more, `len(lst)` is the length of the list `lst`**
