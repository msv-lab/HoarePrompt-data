Output State: **The program returns the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution plus 1.**

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer
- `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\)
- `k` is 0
- `nums` is a deque with exactly one element
- `ans` is the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution
- The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to the first element of `nums`

The code snippet `return ans + 1` indicates that the function returns the value of `ans` incremented by 1. Since no operation changes the value of `ans` within the given context, the return statement simply adds 1 to the existing value of `ans`.

Therefore, the program returns the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution plus 1.
