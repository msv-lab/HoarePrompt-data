Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is 0, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `ans` to the length of list `a` minus 1. Since the initial values of `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are all 0, and the condition that the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a` remains unchanged, these variables remain unaffected. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `len(a) - 1`.
