Output State: **`i` is 20; `ind` is `ind` + 2**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 20. The value of `ind` is incremented by 2, but the exact numerical value of `ind` is not specified in the initial state, so it is described as `ind` + 2. The condition that `n` must be greater than 20 is still valid, but since no changes were made to `n` in the given code snippet, it is not included in the output state.
