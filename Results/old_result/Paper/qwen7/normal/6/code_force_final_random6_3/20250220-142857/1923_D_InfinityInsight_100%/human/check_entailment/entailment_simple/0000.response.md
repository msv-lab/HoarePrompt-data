Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is used to find the index of the first slime that is strictly greater than or equal to the target size `x`.
   - It uses binary search via `bisect_left` to find the appropriate index.
   - The logic is correct and handles edge cases properly, such as returning `-1` if no such slime exists.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.
   - It maintains two lists: `left` for cumulative sums and `last` for the last occurrence of each unique slime size.
   - The logic for updating these lists is correct.
   - The main loop iterates through the slimes and checks if the current slime can eat its left neighbor. If so, it calculates the time and updates the answer accordingly.
   - The use of `func_1` to find the appropriate index for the cumulative sum list is correct.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` twice (once forward and once backward) to account for both directions of eating.
   - It then combines the results from both calls to get the final answer.
   - The logic for combining the results is correct, ensuring that the minimum time is taken into account.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
