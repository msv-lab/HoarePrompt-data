### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing \(k\) operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key insight is that inserting the sum of a subarray multiple times can significantly increase the array's sum.
   - The optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert the sum of the entire array, as this maximizes the sum incrementally.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_2`**: This function aims to find the segment with the highest sum among those containing more than one element. However, the logic in this function seems flawed. It does not correctly identify the segment with the highest sum.
   - **`func_1`**: This function simply returns the remainder of the input number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct and necessary due to the problem statement.
   - **`func_3`**: This function is not used in the provided code and appears to be irrelevant to solving the problem.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly calculates the initial sum of the array.
   - It then uses `func_2` to get the segment with the highest sum (which is incorrect).
   - Finally, it computes the maximum possible sum using the result from `func_2`.

Given these points, the main issue lies in `func_2`, which incorrectly identifies the segment with the highest sum. Therefore, the overall program logic is flawed and does not achieve the desired result.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: False**

The program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly identify the segment with the highest sum, leading to an incorrect maximum possible sum calculation.
