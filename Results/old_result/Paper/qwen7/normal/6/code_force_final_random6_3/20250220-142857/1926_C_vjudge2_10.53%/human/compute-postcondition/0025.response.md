Output State: **`total` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 5, `values[i]` is 5**.

Explanation: The code `values[i] = i` updates the list `values` by setting its 5th index (since indexing starts at 0, this is the 6th element) to the value of `i`, which is 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
