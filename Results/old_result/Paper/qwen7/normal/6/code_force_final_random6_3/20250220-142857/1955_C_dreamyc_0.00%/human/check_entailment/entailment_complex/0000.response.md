Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1`.
2. The function initializes a deque from the list `nums` and iterates while `k` is non-zero and there are at least 2 elements in the deque.
3. In each iteration, it reduces `k` by twice the minimum of the first and last elements of the deque, and updates the deque and the answer `ans` accordingly.
4. After the loop, it checks if `k` is still non-zero and if the deque has exactly one element. If so, it adds one more to `ans` because the remaining element would sink.
5. The final return statement correctly returns the count of sunk ships.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function `func_1` accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
