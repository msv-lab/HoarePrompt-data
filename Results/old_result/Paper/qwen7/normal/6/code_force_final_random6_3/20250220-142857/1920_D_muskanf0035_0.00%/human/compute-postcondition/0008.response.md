Output State: **`queries` is a list of integers converted from input, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `queries` is updated to be a list of integers from the input, `n` and `q` are assigned the values of integers split from input.**

In this step, the code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `q`. The values of `queries`, `operations`, and `result` remain unchanged from their initial state.
