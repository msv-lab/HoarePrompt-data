Output State: **`s` is 0, `i` is `k + m + 1`, `c` is `n * (n - 1) // 1`, `a` is `a + f`, `u` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the third integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a += f` increments the value of `a` by `f`. All other variables remain unchanged. The values of `s`, `i`, `c`, `u`, and `v` are still as they were in the initial state, and `f` retains its value from the input.
