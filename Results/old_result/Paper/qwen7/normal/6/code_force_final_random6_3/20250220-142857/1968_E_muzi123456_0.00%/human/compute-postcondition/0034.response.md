Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 - 1, which simplifies to `t > -1`. This means `t` can be any positive integer or zero.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1):` will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop requires `n` to be at least 1 for it to execute, we need to ensure `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - The value of `i` should be set to `n`, as given in the initial state.
   - The value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution, so it can remain as `t > -1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `i` must be equal to `n`.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is greater than -1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
