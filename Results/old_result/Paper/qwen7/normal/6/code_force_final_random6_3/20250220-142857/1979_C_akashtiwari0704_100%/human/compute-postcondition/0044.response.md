Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`
- `i` is 0

### Loop Statement
```python
for i in range(len(l)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < len(l)`.
3. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
4. **Next Value of `i`**: For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
5. **Condition Check**: We need to check if `i < len(l)` to determine if the loop should continue. Since `i` is now 1, the loop will continue if `len(l) > 1`.

### Adjusted State
- `g` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- The condition for the next iteration requires `len(l) > 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`, `i` is 1, `len(l)` must be greater than 1**
