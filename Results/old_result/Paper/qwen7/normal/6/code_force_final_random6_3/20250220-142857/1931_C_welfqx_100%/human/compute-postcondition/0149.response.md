Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for r in range(t)`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `r` and `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `r < t`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cn` is incremented by `ck`.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `onum` is a list of integers.
   - `ck` is incremented by 1 each time `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]` until a pair of consecutive elements are not equal or the end of the list is reached.
   - If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is further incremented by `ck`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `r` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `r` would be `previous_r + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be less than `t`.

Given that `r` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `r` will be `previous_r + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be less than `t`.

Since `r` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop and it needs to be less than `t` for the loop to continue, we don't need to adjust the other states.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cn` is incremented by `ck`, `n` is an integer, `onum` is a list of integers, `ck` is incremented by 1 each time `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]` until a pair of consecutive elements are not equal or the end of the list is reached, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is further incremented by `ck`, `r` is `previous_r + 1`, and `r` must be less than `t`**.
