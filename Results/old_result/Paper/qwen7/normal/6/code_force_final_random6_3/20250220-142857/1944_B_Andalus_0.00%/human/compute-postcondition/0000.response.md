Output State: **T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specified that `t` (which is later renamed to `T`) is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`, the same condition applies to `T` after the code execution. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
