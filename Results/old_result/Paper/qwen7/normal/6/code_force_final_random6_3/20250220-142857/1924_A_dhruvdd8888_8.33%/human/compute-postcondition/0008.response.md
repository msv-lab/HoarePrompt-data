Output State: **`i` is added to the set `win`; `us` is a set of integers.**

The code `win.add(i)` adds the integer `i` to the set `win`. The set `us` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated set `win` containing `i` and the unchanged set `us`.
