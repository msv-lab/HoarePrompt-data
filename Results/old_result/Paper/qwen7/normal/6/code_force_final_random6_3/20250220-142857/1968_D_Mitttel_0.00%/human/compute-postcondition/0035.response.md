Output State: **`index` is 17 + 3 * n, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`**.

This means that the value of `index` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `17 + 3 * n`. The value of `PB` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `int(data[index + 2])`. The value of `t` is decreased by 2, as it was initially set to `t - 2`. The value of `results` remains unchanged as it was initially set to the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `int(data[index + 1])`. Now, `PS` is updated to the value of `int(data[index + 3])`.
