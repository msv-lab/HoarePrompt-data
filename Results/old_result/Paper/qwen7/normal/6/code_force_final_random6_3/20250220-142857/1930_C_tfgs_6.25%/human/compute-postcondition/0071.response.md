Output State: **`ans` is a list where the last element is now the second last element minus 2, `cnt` is decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `ans` the value of the last element of `ans` minus 1. Since the last element of `ans` was initially the second last element minus 1, the new last element becomes the second last element minus 2. The variable `cnt` is also decreased by 1 but remains greater than 0.
