Output State: **`vis[s]` is 1, `mx` is the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`. It does not affect the values of `vis[s]`, `cur`, `k`, `s`, or `p[s]` directly, but it modifies `mx` based on the given formula. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
