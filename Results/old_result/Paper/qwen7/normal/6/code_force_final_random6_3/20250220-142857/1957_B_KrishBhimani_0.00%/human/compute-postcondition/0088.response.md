Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is `k0 + 1`, `c` is `n - 1`, `ans` contains the value `k0 - sum(ans)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `arr`, `i`, `c`, or `ans`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
