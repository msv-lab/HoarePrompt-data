Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer - 1 and `x` must not be 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 1**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its initial value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial states.
