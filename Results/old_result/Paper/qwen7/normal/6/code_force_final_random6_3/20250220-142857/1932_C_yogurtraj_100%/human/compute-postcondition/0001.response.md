Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `m`. The variable `ii` remains unchanged and is still 0.
