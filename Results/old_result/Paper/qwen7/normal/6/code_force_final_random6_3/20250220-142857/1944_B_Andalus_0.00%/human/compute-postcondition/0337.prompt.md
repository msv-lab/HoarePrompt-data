Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is equal to the previous value of `sz` + 1, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted slice of `lst` containing the first `n` elements, `rgt` is a slice of `lst` containing the remaining elements starting from the `n+1` index, `rgt` is sorted.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the value of `lft[i]`. If `lft[i]` does not equal `lft[i - 1]`, then `sng` either contains the element `lft[i]` appended to it (if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`) or remains unchanged (if the condition `i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]` is not met).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i_end + 1` and less than `n`. If `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the element `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng`'s list has been appended with `lft[i]` if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`, `i` is `i_end + 2` and less than `n`. If `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the element `lft[i]`. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` does not equal `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has appended the value of `lft[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
