Output State: **`hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 4` or `a1 - a2 - 3`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 2` or `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, `i` is `i + 1` and we continue to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in the code does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `hd`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
