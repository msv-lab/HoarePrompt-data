### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit the described settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it checks two conditions using `func_1`:
     - One condition uses \( n + x - 2 \).
     - The other condition uses \( n - x \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates all divisors of a given number \( x \) and returns them in a specific order.
   - It iterates up to the square root of \( x \) to find divisors, which is efficient.
   - The returned list of divisors is constructed by combining the divisors found and their corresponding quotients, then reversing the list of divisors.

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The code checks if \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \). These conditions ensure that \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even, which is necessary for the settling pattern to work.
   - For each valid divisor \( s \), it checks if \( (s + 2) / 2 \ge x \) to ensure that the calculated \( k \) fits the given position \( x \).

5. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The code uses a set to remove duplicate values of \( k \) and then prints the length of the set, which gives the number of valid \( k \) values.

### Conclusion:

The given code correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find all divisors, and the main logic checks the conditions properly.

### Correctness:

**True**
