Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. This means the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `ldb` and `sng` are updated based on the condition: if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` remains unchanged; otherwise, `sng` has the element `lft[i]` appended to it if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` equals `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `i + 1` and `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given the above analysis, let's adjust the states:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.
- `ldb` and `sng` remain unchanged unless the specific conditions in the loop body are met, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we do not change `ldb` and `sng`.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `ldb` and `sng` remain unchanged.**

However, to be precise and follow the format strictly, we can write it as:

**State: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `ldb` and `sng` are updated as described.**
