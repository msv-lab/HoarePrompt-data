Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the input values.

2. **Determine the initial state required for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute based on the number of test cases provided by the user. The user inputs an integer value for the number of test cases.
   - Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Formulate the required state**:
   - The state before the loop starts should include the condition that the input value (which determines the number of iterations) must be a positive integer within the specified range.

Given these points, the required state is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

This ensures that the loop will execute the correct number of times based on the input value provided by the user.
