Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value, which is used as the range for the loop.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: The loop will execute based on the input value. Since the input value is used to determine the number of iterations, we need to ensure that this input value is valid according to the constraints given.

3. **Constraints**: The constraints state that the input value (let's call it `t`) should be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given these points, we need to adjust the state so that the input value `t` is within the specified range.

**State after adjustment**:
- The variable `t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
