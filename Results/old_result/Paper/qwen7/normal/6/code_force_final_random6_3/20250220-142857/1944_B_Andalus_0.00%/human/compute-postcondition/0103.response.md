Output State: **`sz` is 0**

The code `sz = 0` sets the variable `sz` to 0. The initial conditions state that after the loop, `i` is equal to the number of elements in `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sz` is equal to the number of elements in `sng`. Since the code only changes `sz` to 0, the updated state is that `sz` is now 0, while `i` and `rdb` remain as described in the initial state.
