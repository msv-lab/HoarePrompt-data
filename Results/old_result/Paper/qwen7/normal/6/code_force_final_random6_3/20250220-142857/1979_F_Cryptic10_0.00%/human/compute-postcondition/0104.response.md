Output State: The final state of the loop will be such that `path` contains all vertices from the set `remaining_vertices` added during the iterations, with each vertex being added from the highest index `d` down to 0. The `remaining_vertices` set will be empty since every vertex that was present initially has been removed from it and added to `path`. After all iterations, `d` will be -1, as the loop continues to decrement `d` until it reaches -1. `v` and `u` will be the return values of `func_1(0)` after the last iteration, but since the loop breaks once a vertex is added to `path`, `v` might not be added to `path` if `func_1(0)` returns 0 or if the vertex is already in `path`.
