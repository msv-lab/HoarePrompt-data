Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    arr = []
    k0 = k
    i = 0
    while k:
        if k & 1 == 1:
            arr.append(i)
        k = k >> 1
        i += 1
    ans = []
    c = 0
    for i in arr:
        if c == n - 1:
            ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
            break
        c += 1
        ans.append(1 << i)
    ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n` + 2, `ans` is a list with as many elements as there were iterations of the loop, starting with 1, 1, 2, 16, and continuing with each subsequent element being 2 raised to the power of the corresponding index in `arr`, and the final element is `2^i`; `ans` is extended by `0` for each missing element to match the length of `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is 12, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 8, `ans` is a list containing [-11, 16, -5, 256, -32769, 65536, 0, 0].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
