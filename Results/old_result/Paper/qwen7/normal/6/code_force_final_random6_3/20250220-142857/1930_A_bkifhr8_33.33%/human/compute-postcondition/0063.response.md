Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the second element of `lst` is removed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the loop or if statement that was being executed has been broken out of, but the changes to `i`, `ans`, and `lst` remain as described in the initial state.
