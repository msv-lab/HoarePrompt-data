Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is not equal to 1, and `b` is not equal to 1, and if `a` is odd, the condition holds as is. If `a` is even, then `b` must be odd, or `a` must be greater than `b`, or `a` must be less than or equal to `b`.
