Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a sorted list of integers (converted from the original set `nums`), and '0' is included in the sorted list.**

Explanation: The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` sorts the elements of the set `nums` after converting them to integers. Since the set `nums` contains integers and the string '0', when converted to an integer, '0' remains '0'. The sorting operation arranges these integers in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.
