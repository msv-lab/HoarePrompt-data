Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is simply `_` (which is just a placeholder for the loop variable) and `n` (the number of iterations). However, since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state, we only need to consider `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `n > 0`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `remaining_cells` is 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
   - `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`
   - `x` is an integer from the input split
   - `space_x` is equal to `x`
   - `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`
   - `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`
   - `y` is either even or odd
   - `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`
   - If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`; otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated based on `extra_space` being either divisible by 15 or not.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `n`, and assuming the loop can execute again, `n` must be decremented by 1.
   - All other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `y` is either even or odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1, and `n` is decreased by 1**.
