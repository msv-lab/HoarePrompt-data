Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i + 2` is valid, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i + 1` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and `ans` is the minimum value between itself and `cnt` after the if-else block executes.
