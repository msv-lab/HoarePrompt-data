Postcondition: `cnt` is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `tmp` remains the same, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 0, `cnt` is reset to 0, and `i` is incremented by 1.
