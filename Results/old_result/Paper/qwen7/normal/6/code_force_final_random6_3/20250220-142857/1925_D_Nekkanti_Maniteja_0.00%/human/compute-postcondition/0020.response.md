Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 1, `s` is now `2 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`**.

Explanation: The initial value of `s` was `c * i * c * m + c * a`. After executing the line `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, the value of `s` is updated to `s + (c * i * c * m + c * a)`, which simplifies to `2 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
