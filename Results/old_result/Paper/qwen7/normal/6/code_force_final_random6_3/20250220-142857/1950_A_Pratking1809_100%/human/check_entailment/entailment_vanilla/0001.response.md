### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.

Given that the conditions for 'STAIR' and 'PEAK' are correctly implemented and the logic follows the problem statement precisely, the program should work as intended.

### Correctness:
**True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description.
