Output State: `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps - 2`, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `score` is `score + 3 * a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]` three times, `steps` remains unchanged, `visited` dictionary remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is decremented by 3.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `full_cycles` variable remains unchanged, indicating no additional full cycles were completed beyond the initial conditions. The `remaining_steps` is reduced by 3, reflecting the total number of steps processed within the loop. The `score` is increased by three times the value at the current position (`a[current_pos - 1]`), as the loop updates `current_pos` three times. The `current_pos` is updated three times according to the transition array `p`. All other variables, including `cycle_pos`, `cycle_score`, `steps`, `visited`, and `remainder_steps`, remain unchanged from their previous states.
