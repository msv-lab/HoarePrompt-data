Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans)` appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `ans` was being modified. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
