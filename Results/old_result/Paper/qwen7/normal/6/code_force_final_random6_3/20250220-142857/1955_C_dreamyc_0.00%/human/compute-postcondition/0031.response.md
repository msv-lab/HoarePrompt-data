Output State: **`k` is a non-zero integer; `a` is the first element of `nums` after removing the leftmost element; `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element; `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `a` and `b` to `x`. Since `a` is the first element of `nums` after removing the leftmost element, and `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element, `x` will hold the smaller of these two values. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
