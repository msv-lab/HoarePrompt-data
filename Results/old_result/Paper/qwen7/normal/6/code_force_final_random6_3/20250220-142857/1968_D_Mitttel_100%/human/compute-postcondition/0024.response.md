Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration, with `k` being 0, `cur` holding the final value after the last iteration (`cur + a[s]`), `vis[s]` marked as 1, and `s` holding the value of `p[s]` after the loop ends.**

This means that after the loop completes, the program returns the highest value found between `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration, considering `k` is 0, `cur` is the final value after the last iteration, `vis[s]` is marked as 1, and `s` holds the value of `p[s]` from the last iteration.
