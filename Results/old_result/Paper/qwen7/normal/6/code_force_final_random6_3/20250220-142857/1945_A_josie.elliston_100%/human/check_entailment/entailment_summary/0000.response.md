### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences.
   - Each introvert needs a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert needs a tent with two others.
   - Universals can be placed in any configuration (alone, with one, or with two others).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if adding some universals can make the number of extroverts divisible by 3.
   - If the condition is met, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `None`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses `func_1` to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - It adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so it returns `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `extroverts` is already divisible by 3, `func_1` will correctly calculate the number of tents.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0` and adding universals doesn't make it divisible by 3, `func_1` returns `None`, which is handled correctly in `func_2`.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` seems to handle the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
   - The calculations are based on the given conditions and the examples provided match the expected outputs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided information and the execution summaries, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
