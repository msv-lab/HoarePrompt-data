Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is the input string from the user, `lst` is a list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the string `l` into a list of substrings based on spaces. The original values of `t`, `i`, `ans`, `ans_f`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. The new variable `lst` is created and contains the substrings of `l` separated by spaces.
