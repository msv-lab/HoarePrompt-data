Output State: **The program returns the difference between j and i plus 1, which is the length of the sequence where `arr[i]` equals `arr[j-1]` and `i` is incremented to be one less than `j`.**

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is less than `j`
- `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j-1]`
- `j` is not the length of `arr`
- `i` is incremented such that it is now one less than `j`

When the code `return j - i + 1` is executed, it calculates the length of the sequence starting from the new value of `i` (which is `j-1`) up to `j`. Therefore, the length of this sequence is `j - (j-1) + 1 = 2`. Hence, the program returns the value `2`.
