Output State: **`cn` is 2**.

The variable `cn` is incremented by 1, starting from its previous value which was 1 (since it was incremented by 1 to become 2 in the previous state). The other conditions remain unchanged: `i` is still greater than 1, and `n` remains greater than 1. Therefore, the updated state is that `cn` is now 2.
