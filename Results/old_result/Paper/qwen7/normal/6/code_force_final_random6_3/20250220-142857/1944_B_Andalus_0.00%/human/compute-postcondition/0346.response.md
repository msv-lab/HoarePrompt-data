Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, and either `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[0]` (in which case `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]` appended with `rgt[3]`), or `rgt[2]` is not equal to `rgt[0]` (in which case `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]` appended with `rgt[3]`).
