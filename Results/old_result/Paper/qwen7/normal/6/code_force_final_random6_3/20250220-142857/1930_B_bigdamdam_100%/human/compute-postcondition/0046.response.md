Output State: **`ind` is 2, `i` is 2, `p[1]` is 1**

Explanation: Initially, `ind` is 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd. After executing `ind += 2`, the value of `ind` is updated to its current value plus 2. Since `ind` was initially either 0 or 1, adding 2 to it results in `ind` becoming 2. The values of `i` and `p[1]` remain unchanged.
