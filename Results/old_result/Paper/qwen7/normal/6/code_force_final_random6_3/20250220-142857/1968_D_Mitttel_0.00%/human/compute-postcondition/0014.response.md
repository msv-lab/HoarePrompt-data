Output State: **`index` is 13 + n + n, `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is an empty list, `k` is `int(data[4])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` converts the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers. This operation updates the value of `a` but does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `index`, `PB`, `t`, `results`, `k`, `PS`, and `p` remain unchanged. The new value of `a` is a list of integers derived from the specified slice of `data`.
