Output State: **`k` must be non-zero; `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements; `x` is the minimum of the first element `a` and the last element `b` of the original `nums`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `a` and `b` to `x`. Since `a` is the first element of the original `nums` and `b` is the last element of the original `nums`, `x` is now holding the minimum of these two values. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
