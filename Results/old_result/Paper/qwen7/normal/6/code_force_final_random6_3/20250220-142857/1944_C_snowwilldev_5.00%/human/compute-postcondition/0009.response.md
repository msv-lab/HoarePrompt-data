Output State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `cnt[a[3]]` is 2**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cnt[a[i]]` by 1. Given that `i` is 3, `cnt[a[3]]` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt[a[1]]` was initially 1, after the increment, `cnt[a[3]]` becomes 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
