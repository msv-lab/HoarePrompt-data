Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` has been incremented by 1, but no changes were made to `arr` or `num` in the loop body (since it is omitted).

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: Since the loop is iterating over `arr`, the variable `num` will change with each iteration. However, since the loop head does not directly involve `mod_y_map`, `mod_y_key`, or any other variables mentioned in the state at the end of the previous iteration, these variables should not be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only variables that can be adjusted based on the loop head are `num` and `arr`. Since `num` will change with each iteration, we need to indicate that `num` is now the next element in `arr`. The list `arr` remains unchanged.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `arr`, and all other variables retain their original values**.
