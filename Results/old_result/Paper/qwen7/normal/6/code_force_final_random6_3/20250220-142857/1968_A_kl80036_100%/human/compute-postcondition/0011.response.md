Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `t` is within the range 1 to 1000, but its exact value is not specified.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`.

The `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Output: **x - 1 (where x is an input integer)**
