Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` and `r` are indices within the list `a`, `sunks` is either 1, 3, or 4, and `k` is reduced accordingly. If `k >= 2 * a[r]`, then `r` is decremented, `sunks` is set to 3, and `k` is reduced by \(2 * a[r]\). If `k < 2 * a[r]` and `k != 2 * a[r] - 1`, then `sunks` is set to 1, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[0]`, and `a[r]` becomes 0. If `k == 0` or `k < 2 * a[r]` and `k == 2 * a[r] - 1`, then the process breaks out of the loop, and `sunks` is set to 4 if `k == 2 * a[r] - 1`, otherwise it remains as 1 or 3.**
