Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be equal to the total number of iterations completed, which is the initial value of `t` plus the number of additional iterations minus one (since the loop starts counting from 0). For each iteration, `n` will be an input integer, and `nums` will be a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting. The final state of `nums` will be the result of sorting the last input list of integers in descending order.

In simpler terms, `t` will be the total number of iterations the loop ran, `n` will be the most recent input integer, and `nums` will be the sorted list of integers from the last input, sorted in descending order.
