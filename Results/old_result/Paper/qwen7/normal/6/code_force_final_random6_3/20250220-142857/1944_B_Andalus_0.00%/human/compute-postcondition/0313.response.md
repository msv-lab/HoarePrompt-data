Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` in the range `1` to `n`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be at least `1` and `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts at `1`, we don't need to change its initial value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least `1` for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider other variables**:
   - `ldb`, `sz`, `rdb`, `sng`, `lft`, and `rgt` are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly affect the loop's execution. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
