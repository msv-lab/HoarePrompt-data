Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2)`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`.**

Explanation: The code updates `res` to be the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`. The values of `i`, `hd`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
