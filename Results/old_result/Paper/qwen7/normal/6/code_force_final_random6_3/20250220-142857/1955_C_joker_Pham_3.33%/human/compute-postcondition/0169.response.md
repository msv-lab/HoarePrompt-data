Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and `a` (a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n). It returns `sunks`, which is the total count of valid operations performed on the list `a`. The function also returns the final values of `l` and `r`, indicating the remaining bounds of the unprocessed elements in the list, and `k` is the remaining value after all possible operations have been attempted.**
