You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The loop terminates when either `i` becomes greater than `j` or the condition `arr[i] != arr[j]` is met during an iteration.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `i` is less than or equal to `j`, and the condition `arr[i] == arr[j]` holds true
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is less than `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j-1]`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be one less than `j`, and the element at index `i` will still be equal to the element at index `j`. The loop continues to increment `i` as long as the current element is equal to the next element, effectively skipping over consecutive duplicates until it reaches the point where either `i` equals `j-1` or the elements no longer match.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between j and i plus 1, which is the length of the sequence where `arr[i]` equals `arr[j-1]` and `i` is incremented to be one less than `j`.
    #State: `i` is less than `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j-1]`, and `j` is equal to the length of `arr` minus one
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between j (which is the length of `arr` minus one) and i (which is less than j), given that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j-1]`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It returns 0 if no valid sequence is found. Otherwise, it returns the length of the sequence where `arr[i]` equals `arr[j-1]`, with `i` being incremented to be one less than `j`. If no such sequence is found with `i` being incremented to be one less than `j`, it returns the length of the sequence where `arr[i]` equals `arr[j-1]` and `i` is less than `j-1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the difference between j and i plus 1, which is the length of the sequence where `arr[i]` equals `arr[j-1]` and `i` is incremented to be one less than `j`.

Case_3: The program returns the difference between j (which is the length of `arr` minus one) and i (which is less than j), given that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j-1]`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
