Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `bb` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in `aa` up to index `m-1`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is either `fnd` + 1 or `fnd` (if `tot` is less than `k`), `tot` is the sum of the values in `D.values()`, `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `C[in_aa] + 1` or greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is either not decreased by 1 or is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D.values()`, `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `C[in_aa] + 1` or greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is either not decreased at all or decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the corresponding element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is either not decreased at all or decreased by 1 again, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. Additionally, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tot` is the sum of the values in `D.values()`, `fnd` is increased by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` and `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged, `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `C[in_aa] + 1` or greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` and `D[out_aa]` are each decreased by 1, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]` and `out_aa` is the corresponding element in `aa[:n - m]`, both `in_aa` and `out_aa` are updated to the next elements in their respective slices, and `C[out_aa]` and `E[in_aa]` are each increased by 1 if the `else` part is executed, `fnd` is `fnd + 1` if `tot >= k` and `E[out_aa] > 0` else `fnd` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
