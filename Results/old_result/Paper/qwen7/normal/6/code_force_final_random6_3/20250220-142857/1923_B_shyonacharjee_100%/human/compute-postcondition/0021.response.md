Postcondition: **`can_survive` remains `False`, `bullets_used` is `health`, `total_bullets_needed` is `2 * health`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, the first element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `pos`, the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `health`, and `distance` is `abs(pos)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
