Output State: **The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `sng` and `sz` is less than `k`. After all iterations, `sz` will be equal to the size of `sng`, and the loop will break once `sz` is no longer less than `k`. The output will be the elements of `sng` printed in order until the condition `sz >= k` is met.**

In simpler terms, the loop will print each element of `sng` until it reaches the size of `k` or runs out of elements in `sng`. Once the loop breaks, `sz` will be equal to the minimum value between the size of `sng` and `k`.
