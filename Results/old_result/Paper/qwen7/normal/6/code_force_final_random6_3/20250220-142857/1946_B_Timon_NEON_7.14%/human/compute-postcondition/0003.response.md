Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `max_sum = -1` initializes the variable `max_sum` to -1. The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants`) remain unchanged as they were initially empty or zero.
