Output State: **`segments_variants` must contain at least one element; total_max_segment is now equal to segment; the length of segment is not 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`. This means that `total_max_segment` now holds the same value as `segment`. The other conditions and the length of `segment` remain unchanged.
