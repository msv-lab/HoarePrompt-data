Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(a))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `len(a)` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. 

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration (though the increment is not explicitly shown, it is implied), the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`. Therefore, `i` will become `1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Given that `i` is now 2, `len(a)` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the state**: Based on the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the condition for `len(a)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 2**
