Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `ii` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `ii = 0` to `ii = n - 2` (since it's `range(n - 1)`).

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 0, `n` is a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times, `cn` is 0, and `num` is a list. The postcondition also mentions that if `onum[0]` is equal to `onum[1]`, then `ck` is set to 1. However, this information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop head variables.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `ii` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `ii` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `ii` will be 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `cn` and `num` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times, `cn` is 0, and `num` is a list**.
