Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1 if it was greater than 0; `n` is an integer from `data[idx]`; `idx` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The initial conditions of `t` being decremented by 1 if it was greater than 0 and `n` being an integer from `data[idx]` remain valid. Therefore, `idx` is increased by 1.
