Postcondition: `cur_arr` contains at least one element, `xor` is the result of XORing each element in `cur_arr` with the current value of `xor`. If `xor` shifted right by `bit` bits and bitwise AND with 1 is not 1, then `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains unchanged.
