Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer n, a string s of length n consisting of '0' and '1', and a string f of length n consisting of '0' and '1'. The function determines the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (represented by string s) to the desired state (represented by string f).**

Given the constraints, the function will iterate through multiple test cases, each containing an integer n, and two strings s and f. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to change s into f, where an operation consists of flipping the state of any box (changing '0' to '1' or '1' to '0').
