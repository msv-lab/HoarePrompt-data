You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` must be exactly equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, which is greater than 0. For each iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. The variable `res` will be a list with `n` elements all set to 1 if `k` equals `n`, a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list with a single element `-1` otherwise.
    #
    #This means after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will reflect the total number of iterations, and for each iteration, `res` will be determined based on the conditions provided with the respective `n` and `k` values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It outputs a list \( res \) based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case. If \( k \) equals \( n \), the list contains \( n \) ones. If \( k \) equals 1, the list is a range object from 0 to \( n-1 \). Otherwise, the list contains a single element \(-1\). The function does not return any value but prints the resulting list for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts of `a` are sorted. If no such array exists, we should return `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then generates a result list `res` based on the value of `k`:
     - If `k == n`, it returns `[1] * n` (an array of `n` ones).
     - If `k == 1`, it returns `range(n)` (an array from `0` to `n-1`).
     - Otherwise, it returns `[-1]`.

3. **Checking the Correctness**:
   - **Case `k == n`**: An array where all elements are the same (e.g., `[1] * n`) will have all cyclic shifts sorted. This is correct.
   - **Case `k == 1`**: An array with distinct elements (e.g., `range(n)`) will have only one cyclic shift sorted (the original array). This is also correct.
   - **Case `k != n` and `k != 1`**: The program returns `[-1]`, indicating no valid array can be generated. However, this is not always true. For example, consider `n = 3` and `k = 2`. A valid array could be `[1, 2, 3]` because its cyclic shifts are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 1, 2]`, with exactly 2 of them being sorted.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate a valid array when `1 < k < n`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not provide a solution for cases where `1 < k < n`.
