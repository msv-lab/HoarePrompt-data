Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
