Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `y` is either even or odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1, and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `remaining_cells` based on the formula `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `remaining_cells` is now explicitly defined as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
