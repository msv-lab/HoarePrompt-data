### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the correctness of the program step-by-step:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\). However, \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) might not be an integer, and even if it is, the inverse should be calculated properly. This is indeed a critical issue.

2. **Incorrect Formula for Expected Value**:
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` is not correct for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should consider the probability of picking each pair and the effect of increasing the friendship value after each pick. This is another significant flaw.

3. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse Calculation**:
   - The modular multiplicative inverse should be calculated correctly using an appropriate method such as the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or Fermat's Little Theorem. The current implementation is flawed.

Given these issues, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the original assessment.
