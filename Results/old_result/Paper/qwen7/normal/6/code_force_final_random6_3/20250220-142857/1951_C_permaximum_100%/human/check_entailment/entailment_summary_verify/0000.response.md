### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of ticket prices `prices`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Initializes a priority queue (heap) with tuples of `(price, day)` for each day.
   - Uses a while loop to buy tickets until the total number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) reaches `k`.
   - For each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, increments the price by the current `price_increase`, and calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`).
   - Updates the total cost and the number of tickets bought.
   - Increases the `price_increase` by the number of tickets bought.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The use of a heap ensures that the cheapest ticket price is always considered first.
   - The heap is updated after each purchase, ensuring that the next ticket price is adjusted based on the previous purchase.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is less than or equal to the product of `n` and `m`. In such cases, the program will terminate properly.
   - The program also handles the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought exceeds the product of `n` and `m`. In such cases, the program will still terminate because it will eventually run out of tickets to buy.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function correctly initializes a priority queue with the ticket prices and indices.
- It uses a while loop to buy tickets until the required number of tickets is reached.
- It correctly updates the total cost and the number of tickets bought.
- It ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought each day.
- It correctly updates the price increase for subsequent days.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where `k` exceeds `n * m` and will lead to an infinite loop.
- However, the program uses a priority queue and a while loop to ensure that it terminates when the required number of tickets is bought.
- The program will not enter an infinite loop because it will eventually run out of tickets to buy, even if `k` exceeds `n * m`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly handles the scenario where `k` exceeds `n * m` and will terminate properly.

**Final: True**
