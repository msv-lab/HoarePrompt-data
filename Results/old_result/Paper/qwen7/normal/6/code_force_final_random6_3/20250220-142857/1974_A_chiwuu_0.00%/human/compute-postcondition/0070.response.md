Output State: The final value of `t` will be determined by the cumulative effect of the operations performed within the loop over all iterations. Specifically, for each iteration, the value of `t` is updated based on the values of `a` and `b` read from the input, with adjustments made according to the conditions provided. After all iterations, `t` will be the sum of its initial value (which is `b * 2` adjusted by the modulo operation) plus any additional increments due to the `t2` calculations where `t2 = a - t1` and the adjustments based on divisibility by 15.

The exact final value of `t` cannot be specified without knowing the specific values of `a` and `b` for each iteration, but it will be the result of repeatedly applying the logic described in the loop body across all iterations.
