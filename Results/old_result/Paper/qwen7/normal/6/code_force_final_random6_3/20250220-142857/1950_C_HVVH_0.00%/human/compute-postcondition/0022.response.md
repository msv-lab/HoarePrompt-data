To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic applied to the variables:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - `h` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.

2. **Logic Applied**:
   - If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, then `h` is set to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, then `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.

Given these rules, the value of `h` and `day` after the logic is applied will depend on the initial values of `h` and `day`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```

This print statement formats `h` and `m` to ensure they are two digits long, padding with a leading zero if necessary, and then prints them followed by the value of `day`.

### Possible Scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**: `h` is 0.
  - After applying the logic: `h` becomes 12 and `day` becomes 'AM'.
  - Print statement: `print('12:00', 'AM')`
  - Output: **12:00 AM**

- **Scenario 2**: `h` is 12.
  - After applying the logic: `day` becomes 'AM'.
  - Print statement: `print('12:00', 'AM')`
  - Output: **12:00 AM**

- **Scenario 3**: `h` is between 1 and 11.
  - `day` remains 'PM'.
  - Print statement: `print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', 'PM')`
  - Example: If `h` is 3 and `m` is 45, the output would be `03:45 PM`.
  - Output: **[h:02d]:[m:02d] PM** (where `[h:02d]` and `[m:02d]` represent the formatted values of `h` and `m` respectively)

- **Scenario 4**: `h` is between 13 and 23.
  - After applying the logic: `h` becomes `h - 12` and `day` becomes 'PM'.
  - Print statement: `print(f'{h - 12:02d}:{m:02d}', 'PM')`
  - Example: If `h` is 15 and `m` is 30, the output would be `03:30 PM`.
  - Output: **[h - 12:02d]:[m:02d] PM** (where `[h - 12:02d]` and `[m:02d]` represent the formatted values of `h - 12` and `m` respectively)

### General Output Format:
Based on the scenarios, the general format of the output will be:
- For `h` between 1 and 11: **[h:02d]:[m:02d] PM**
- For `h` between 13 and 23: **[h - 12:02d]:[m:02d] PM**
- For `h` being 0: **12:00 AM**
- For `h` being 12: **12:00 AM**

However, since the exact values of `h` and `m` are not specified, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **[h:02d]:[m:02d] [day]** (where `[h:02d]` and `[m:02d]` represent the formatted values of `h` and `m` respectively, and `[day]` represents the value of `day` after applying the logic).
