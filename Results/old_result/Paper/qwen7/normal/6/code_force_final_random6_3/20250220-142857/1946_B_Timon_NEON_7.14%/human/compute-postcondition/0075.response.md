Output State: `total_max_segment` is the list with the maximum sum of any segment found among all the segments_variants, and `segment` is the last segment variant checked before the loop terminates. The `segments_variants` list contains all possible valid segment variants found during the loop execution, including the final `max_segment` appended to it. The `i` variable is equal to `n` (the length of `arr`), and `max_sum` remains -1. The `new_segment` and `max_segment` variables are no longer used after the loop completes, and `arr` remains a non-empty list.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `total_max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum from all the segments considered, and `segment` will be the last segment variant that was compared against `total_max_segment`. All valid segments found during the loop are stored in `segments_variants`. The loop counter `i` is set to the length of the input list `arr`, and `max_sum` remains unchanged at -1.
