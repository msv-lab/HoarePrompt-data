Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Calculation of Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates `t` as `b * 2`, which is incorrect. A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so the correct calculation should be `t = b * 4`.

2. **Handling Remaining Space After Placing 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program then checks if the remaining space (`t1`) is sufficient to fit the 1x1 icons. However, the logic to calculate `t1` is flawed. It should be calculated as `t1 = 15 * t - b * 4` (since each screen has 15 cells).

3. **Final Calculation of Screens Needed**:
   - The final calculation of `t` is incorrect. It should ensure that the remaining 1x1 icons fit into the remaining space, but the current logic does not properly account for this.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        t = (b * 4 + 4) // 5  # Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, plus 1 extra cell for rounding up
        # Calculate the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = 15 * t - b * 4
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        t += (a + remaining_space - 1) // 15  # Ceiling division to account for any remaining space
        print(t)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the calculations are done accurately, taking into account the space occupied by 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons.
