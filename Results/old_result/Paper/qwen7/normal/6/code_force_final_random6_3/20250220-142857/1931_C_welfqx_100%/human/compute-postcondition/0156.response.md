Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, and the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, or `num`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
