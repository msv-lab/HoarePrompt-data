Output State: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `y` is either even or odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1, and `n` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the input and splits them into `x` and `y`. The values of `remaining_cells`, `t`, `result`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information is that `x` and `y` are now integers from the input.
