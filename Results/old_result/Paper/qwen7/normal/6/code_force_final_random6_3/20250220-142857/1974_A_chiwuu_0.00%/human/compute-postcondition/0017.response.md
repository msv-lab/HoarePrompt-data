Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, `t` remains unchanged, and the current value of `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. All other variables remain in their initial states as described in the initial conditions.
