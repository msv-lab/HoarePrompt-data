Output State: **`nabors` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The precondition that `nabors` must be at least 1 remains valid, and now `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the respective values from the input.
