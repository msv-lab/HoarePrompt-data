Postcondition: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 2`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, `i` is less than `n` and becomes `i + 1`. If `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is decremented by 1 and the loop continues. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `hd` is further decremented by 1 and `res` is incremented by 1.
