Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where for each case, it either prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' and returns None based on specific conditions.**

- For each test case, the function checks certain conditions related to the number of stones in piles and determines whether to print 'Alice' or 'Bob'.
- If the conditions lead to printing 'Alice', the function prints 'Alice'.
- If the conditions lead to printing 'Bob', the function prints 'Bob' and returns None.
