Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` holds the maximum sum of contiguous subarray elements in the list `l` that meets the condition specified in the loop, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and any individual element in `l` that is less than `0` and whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This changes the values of `n` and `k` to the integers entered by the user. However, the values of `c`, `maxi`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 as part of the operation.
