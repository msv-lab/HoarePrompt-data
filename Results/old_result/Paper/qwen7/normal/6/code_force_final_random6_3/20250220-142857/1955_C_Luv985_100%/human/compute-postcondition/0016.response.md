Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` decreases the value of `a[r]` by `mi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
