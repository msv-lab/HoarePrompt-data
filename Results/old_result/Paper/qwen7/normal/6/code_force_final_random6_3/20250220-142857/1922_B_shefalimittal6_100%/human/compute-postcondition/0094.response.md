Postcondition: `cnt` is increased by `v[i + 1]`, `i` is in the range `[1, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. If `v[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is further increased by `cnt * v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) // 2 + v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) * (v[i + 1] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i + 1]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.
