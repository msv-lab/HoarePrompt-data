Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `l` by spaces.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `l` into a list of substrings using spaces as delimiters. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `lst`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `ans`, `ans_f`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
