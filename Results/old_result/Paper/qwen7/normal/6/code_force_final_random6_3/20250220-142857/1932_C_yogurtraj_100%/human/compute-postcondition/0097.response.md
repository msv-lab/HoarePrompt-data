Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `n` remains greater than 2, as it was initially.
- `q1` and `q2` will be updated based on the sequence of 'R' and 'L' in the list `t`. Specifically, `q1` will be `l - (n - 1)` and `q2` will be `l + (n - 1)`, where `l` is the initial value derived from the conditions given in the initial state.
- `k` will hold the final value after all multiplications and mod operations have been performed according to the instructions in the loop.
- The list `y` will be filled with the intermediate values of `k` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`, with each element updated according to the loop's logic.

The `print(*y)` statement will print the contents of the list `y`, which contains the intermediate values of `k` after each iteration of the loop.

Output: **[k0, k1, ..., kn-1]** (where `k0, k1, ..., kn-1` are the intermediate values of `k` after each iteration of the loop)
