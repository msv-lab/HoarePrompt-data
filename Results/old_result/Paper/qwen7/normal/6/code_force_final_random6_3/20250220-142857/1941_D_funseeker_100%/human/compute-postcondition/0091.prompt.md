Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, and `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    r, c = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q + r) % n)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q - r) % n)
    ans = temp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element and is now equal to `temp`, `r` is an integer converted from the string `r`, `c` is a string equal to either '0' or '?', and `temp` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` now contains all the elements from `temp`, and `temp` no longer exists as a separate variable.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is now equal to `temp`, `temp` is a set containing up to three elements depending on the value of `c` in each iteration, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer, `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`, and `c` could be any character, and `q` is the last element processed in the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
