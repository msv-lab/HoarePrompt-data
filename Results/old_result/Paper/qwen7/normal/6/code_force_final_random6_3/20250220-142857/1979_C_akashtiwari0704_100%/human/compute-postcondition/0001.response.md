Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `T` which is being assigned the values from `range(t)`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will run as long as `T` takes on values from `range(t)`. Since `t` is given as an input and is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), the loop will start with `T = 0` and increment until `T < t`.

3. **Initial State**: Before the loop starts, `t` is set to a value obtained from `int(input())`, and `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute, `T` must start at 0 and increment until it is less than `t`. Therefore, the initial state of `T` should be 0, and it should be incremented within the loop.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `T` starting at 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged**
