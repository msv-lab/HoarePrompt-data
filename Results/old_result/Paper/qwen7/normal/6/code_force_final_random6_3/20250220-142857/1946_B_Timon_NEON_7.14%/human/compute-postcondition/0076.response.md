Output State: `total_max_segment` is the list with the maximum sum among all the segments found in `segments_variants`, and `segment` is the last element in `segments_variants`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `total_max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum from all the segments considered in `segments_variants`. The variable `segment` will be the last segment evaluated in the loop, which, in this case, would be the last element in the `segments_variants` list since the loop updates `total_max_segment` whenever it finds a segment with a higher sum. All other variables remain unchanged from their final states after the third iteration.
