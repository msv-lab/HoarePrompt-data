Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is 7.
   - `ans[8]` must satisfy `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6]) <= arr[8]`.
   - `ans[8]` is `ans[7] + ans[7]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 8. The loop condition then becomes `ans[9] <= arr[9]`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to adjust `i` to 8.
   - We do not need to adjust the values of `ans[8]` or `arr[8]` because they are derived from the previous state and do not directly affect the loop condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 8**
