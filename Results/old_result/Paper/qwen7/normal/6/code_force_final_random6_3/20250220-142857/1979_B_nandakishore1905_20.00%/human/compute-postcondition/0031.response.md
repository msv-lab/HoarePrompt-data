Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from `t`.
- `m` is the second integer input split from `t`.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.

The print statement simply outputs the number `2`.

Output: **2**
