Output State: **`vals` is an empty list; `den` is `den - sum(vprod)`**.

Explanation: Initially, `vals` is an empty list, and `den` is the final result obtained by successively applying the `func_1(den, x)` function to each element `x` in the original list `vals`. Since `vals` is empty, no elements are processed by `func_1`, meaning `den` remains unchanged from its initial value. However, the code subtracts `sum(vprod)` from `den`. Here, `vprod` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it refers to a variable that has been previously defined and holds a value. After executing `den = den - sum(vprod)`, `den` is updated to be its original value minus the sum of `vprod`. The state of `vals` remains unchanged as it is still an empty list.
