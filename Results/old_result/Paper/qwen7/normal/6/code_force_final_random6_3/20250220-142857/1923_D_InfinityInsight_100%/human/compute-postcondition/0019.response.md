Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `last` is a list with its last element repeated.**

Explanation: The code `last.append(last[-1])` appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. Since the initial state does not specify the exact elements of the list `last`, we only know that the last element of `last` is repeated. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
