Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a set containing the integers split from the input string, and '0' is added to the set `nums`.**

In this output state, the set `nums` now contains all the integers originally present in the set along with the string `'0'` added to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
