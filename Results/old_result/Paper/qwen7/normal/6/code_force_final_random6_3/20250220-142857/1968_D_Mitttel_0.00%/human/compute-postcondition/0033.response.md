Output State: **`index` is 17 + 3 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, and `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` converted to an integer to the variable `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
