Output State: **`index` is 13 + 2 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `n` is `int(data[index])**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `PS` to be the integer from `data[index + 3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
