Output State: **`x` is 1, `a` is `l[1]`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, `c` is 2, and `n` remains unchanged if `a` is not greater than `b`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. All other variables (`x`, `a`, `b`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
