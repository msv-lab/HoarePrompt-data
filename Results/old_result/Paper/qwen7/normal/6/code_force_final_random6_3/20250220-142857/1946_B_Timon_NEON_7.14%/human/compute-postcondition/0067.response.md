Postcondition: `total_max_segment` and `segment` are lists. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`, and `segment` retains its original values. If `total_max_segment[0]` is not less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` and `segment` retain their original values.
