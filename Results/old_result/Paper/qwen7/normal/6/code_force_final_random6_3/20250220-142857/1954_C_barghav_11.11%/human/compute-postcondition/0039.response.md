State before the loop starts: The loop will iterate over the list `a`, and after all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`. The list `a` will have its elements transformed based on specific rules within the loop. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`, so we can only adjust those.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `i` to 0 (the starting point of the loop) and `len(a)` to a value that allows the loop to run through all elements of `a`.

State: **`i` is 0, `len(a)` must be greater than 0**
