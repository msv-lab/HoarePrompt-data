Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has alternating elements that would make it beautiful after removing a single element. For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program should output `1` because removing the second element (`2`) makes the array `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario properly. It checks if the array is already beautiful and if not, it tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove, but it does not correctly identify the need to remove a single element in the case of alternating sequences.

To fix this, the program needs to specifically check for alternating sequences and handle them appropriately.
