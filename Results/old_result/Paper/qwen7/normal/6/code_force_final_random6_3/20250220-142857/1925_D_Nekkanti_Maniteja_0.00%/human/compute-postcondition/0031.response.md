Output State: **`i` is `k`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `c` is `(n * (n - 1) // 1), `a` is 0**.

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `a`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `a` is now 0.
