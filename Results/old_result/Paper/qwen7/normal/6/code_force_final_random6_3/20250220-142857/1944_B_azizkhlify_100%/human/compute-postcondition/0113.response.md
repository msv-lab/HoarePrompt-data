Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- The condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` holds true, meaning that `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.

Given this, we need to determine the value of `a[i]` when the print statement executes. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `a[i]` is the same as `a[n]`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

This will print the value of `a[n]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **a[n] a[n]**
