Output State: **`ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `i` is in the range `[0, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to its previous value. The variables `i`, `n`, and `v[i]` retain their original conditions: `i` is within the specified range, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.
