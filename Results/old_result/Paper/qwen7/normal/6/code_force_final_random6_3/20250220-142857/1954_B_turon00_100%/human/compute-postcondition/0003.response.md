Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes an input string, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the string into a list of substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer using the `map` function, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an input integer.
