Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive duplicates found, `end` is still 0, and `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`. After each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1 and `st` (which counts the number of consecutive duplicates) is incremented. The loop terminates when `l` is no longer less than `r`. At this point, `l` will be equal to `r` because the condition `l < r` becomes false. The value of `st` will be the total count of consecutive duplicates found during the loop's execution. The values of `end` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is equal to `r - 2`, `r` is `n - 3`, `st` is the total number of consecutive duplicates found, `end` is 1, and `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` is equal to `r - 3`, `r` is `n - 4`, and `end` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `l` is equal to `r - 4`, `r` is `n - 5`, and `end` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
