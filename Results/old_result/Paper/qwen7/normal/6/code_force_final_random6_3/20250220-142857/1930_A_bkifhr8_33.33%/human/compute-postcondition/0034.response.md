Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n * 2`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, and `n` is the input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain the same as the initial state. The output state includes all the conditions and values from the initial state, updated with the new information that `ans` has been appended to `ans_f`.
