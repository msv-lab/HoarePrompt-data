Postcondition: **The list `array` remains a permutation of integers of length `n`, `l` will be either 0 or the last computed midpoint plus one, `r` will be either the last computed midpoint minus one or 0, and `mid` will be the final midpoint value. The search range has been exhausted without finding an element that meets the condition `array[mid] >= find`.**
