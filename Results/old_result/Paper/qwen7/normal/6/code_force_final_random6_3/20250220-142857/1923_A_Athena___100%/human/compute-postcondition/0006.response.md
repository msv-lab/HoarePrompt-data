Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, the first element of `a` is now the second element of the original list, `res` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Initially, the first element of `a` is 0. After executing the code, the first element of `a` becomes the second element of the original list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
