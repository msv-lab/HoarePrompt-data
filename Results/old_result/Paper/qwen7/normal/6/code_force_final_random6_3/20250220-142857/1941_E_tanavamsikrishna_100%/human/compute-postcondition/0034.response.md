Output State: **`i` is `d-4` + 1, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` contains a new tuple where the first element is `row[d-4]` and the second element is `-5` or less.**

Explanation: The code `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))` pushes a new tuple into the `min_heap`. The first element of the tuple is `row[i]`, where `i` is `d-4`. After the push operation, `i` is incremented by 1 because it is used as an index in the list `row`. The second element of the tuple remains `-5` or less as per the initial condition. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
