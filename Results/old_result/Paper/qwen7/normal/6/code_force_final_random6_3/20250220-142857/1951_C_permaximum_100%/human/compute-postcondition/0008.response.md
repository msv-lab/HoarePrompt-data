Output State: **`total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a heap with one less element, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0, `price` is the price popped from the heap, `day` is the day popped from the heap, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`) as the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets purchasable each day) and `k - tickets_bought` (number of tickets left to buy). The other variables remain unchanged.
