The only variables in the loop head are `tickets_bought` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `tickets_bought < k`. Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0, and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

For the loop to execute the first time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`. Since `tickets_bought` is currently 0, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 (which it already is, as it is a positive integer).

Therefore, no additional adjustments are necessary for the given states.

State: **`total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a heap, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0**
