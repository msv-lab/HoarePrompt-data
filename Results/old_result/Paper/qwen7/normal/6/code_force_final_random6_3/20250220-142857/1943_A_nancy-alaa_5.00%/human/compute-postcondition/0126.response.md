Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 each iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the `range` function.

3. **Postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is an integer equal to the input integer.
   - If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` or if `mpp[i] != 1` and `first` is true, the loop breaks.
   - If `mpp[i] == 1`, the loop continues without further changes to `i` and `n`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the start of the current iteration.
   - There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged value of `n`.

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer**
