Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input, regardless of the condition `a < b > c`, the values of `t`, `q`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
