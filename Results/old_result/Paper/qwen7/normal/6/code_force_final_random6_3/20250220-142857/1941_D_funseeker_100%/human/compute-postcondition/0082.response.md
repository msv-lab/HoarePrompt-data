Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `c` is a character.
- If `c` is either `'0'` or `'?'`, then `temp` contains the value `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is neither `'0'` nor `'?'`, then no change is made to `temp`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined as follows:
```python
for q in ans:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over each element `q` in the list `ans`.
- The variable `q` is the only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration.
- The variable `c` and `temp` are not directly modified within the loop head but depend on the condition inside the loop body.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - Since `q` is the only variable that changes in the loop head, we need to adjust its state.
   - The other variables (`c` and `temp`) are not directly affected by the loop head itself, so their states remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

2. **Adjust the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is a character, and `temp` has a specific value based on the condition.
   - For the next iteration, `q` will be the next element in the list `ans`.

### New State
- `c` remains a character (unchanged).
- `temp` remains with its current value (unchanged unless modified within the loop body).
- `q` will be the next element in the list `ans`.

### Final Answer
State: **`c` is a character, `temp` contains the value based on the previous condition, `q` is the next element in the list `ans`**.

Since the exact value of `temp` is not specified and depends on the previous condition, we keep it as "the value based on the previous condition". 

State: **`c` is a character, `temp` contains the value based on the previous condition, `q` is the next element in the list `ans`**.
