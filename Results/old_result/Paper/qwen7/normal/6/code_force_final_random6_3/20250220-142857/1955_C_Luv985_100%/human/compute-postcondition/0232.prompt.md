Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `T` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element may have been decremented multiple times, `l` is equal to `r`, indicating that the left pointer has caught up to the right pointer, `r` is equal to `l`, indicating that the right pointer has caught up to the left pointer, and `ans` is 0 since `k` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is adjusted based on the final conditions within the loop, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` and `r` are such that they are either pointing to positions where elements are zero or are out of bounds, `ans` is incremented by `k >= a[l]`, `mi` is the minimum value between the last two non-zero elements considered in the loop, and `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2 if `k` is still positive. Additionally, the condition `l == r` is true.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer less than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is equal to `r` and `r` is 0, `ans` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[0]` which is `a[0]`, and `t` is `k % 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
