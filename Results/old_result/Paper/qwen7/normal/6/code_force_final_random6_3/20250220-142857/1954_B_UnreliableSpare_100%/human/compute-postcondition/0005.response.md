Output State: **`flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the current value of `arr[i - 1]`**

The value of `flag` is explicitly set to `False`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and the condition about `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
