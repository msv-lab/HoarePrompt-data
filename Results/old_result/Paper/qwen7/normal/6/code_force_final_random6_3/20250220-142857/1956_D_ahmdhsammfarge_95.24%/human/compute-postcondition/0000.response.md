Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers of length n, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), and ops is a list containing [[r + 1, l + 1]].**

The code appends a list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. The values of `lst`, `n`, `r`, `l`, and the condition `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)` remain unchanged. The `ops` list now contains the appended list.
