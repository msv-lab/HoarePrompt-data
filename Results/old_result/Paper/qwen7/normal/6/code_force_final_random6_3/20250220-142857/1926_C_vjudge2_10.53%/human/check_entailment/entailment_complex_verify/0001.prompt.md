- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` must still be greater than 0 (ensuring the loop ran `t` times), and `numbers` will be a list containing exactly `t` integers, each of which was input by the user during the respective iteration of the loop.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length 9 filled with zeros (since the loop runs up to 9 times), `sum_values` is a list of length 9 filled with zeros, `i` is 11.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs 10 times as specified by the `range(10)` statement. Each iteration sets `values[i]` to `i`, increments `total` by `i`, and updates `sum_values[i]` to the current value of `total`. After 10 iterations, `total` will be the sum of numbers from 0 to 9, which is 45. The variable `i` will be set to 11 after the last iteration since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The lists `values` and `sum_values` are updated according to the loop, but their final lengths and contents are determined by the loop's range, resulting in lists of length 10 filled with values from 0 to 9 for `values` and the cumulative sums from 0 to 45 for `sum_values`.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 21, `word` is '21', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 6, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3, `sum_values[13]` is 6, `values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[21]` is 6.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all 10 iterations, the variable `i` will be 21 because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The `word` variable will hold the string representation of `i`, which is '21'. The `last` variable will be the last digit of `i`, which is 1, and `remainder` will be the integer formed by the remaining digits, which is 2. The `sum_total` will be the sum of `values[i]` and `sum_values[i-1]`, which is 3 + 3 = 6. The `values` list will have the value 3 at index 21, and the `sum_values` list will have the cumulative sums from 0 to 6 at indices 11 to 21.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list with 10 or more integers, `i` is 21, `word` is '21', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 12, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3, `sum_values[13]` is 6, `values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[21]` is 6, `sum_values[22]` is 9, `sum_values[23]` is 15, `sum_values[24]` is 21, `sum_values[25]` is 28, `sum_values[26]` is 36, `sum_values[27]` is 45, `values[22]` is 3, `values[23]` is 3, `values[24]` is 3, `values[25]` is 3, `values[26]` is 3, `values[27]` is 3.
    #
    #**Explanation:** After the loop completes all 10 iterations, the variable `i` will be 21 because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The `word` variable will hold the string representation of `i`, which is '21'. The `last` variable will be the last digit of `i`, which is 1, and `remainder` will be the integer formed by the remaining digits, which is 2. The `sum_total` will be the sum of `values[i]` and `sum_values[i-1]`, which accumulates as the loop runs. Each iteration adds the value 3 to `values[i]` and updates `sum_values[i]` accordingly. By the end of the loop, `sum_total` will be 12 (from the initial value of 6 plus the contributions from the next 5 iterations), and `values` and `sum_values` will be updated to reflect these changes up to index 27.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, an integer `n`. It then initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, both of length 10, filled with zeros. It populates these lists based on the first 10 integers and their cumulative sums. For each integer `n` from 10 to the maximum value in the input list `numbers`, it calculates a new value for `values[n]` using the last digit and the integer formed by the remaining digits. It also updates the `sum_values` list accordingly. Finally, it prints the values from the `sum_values` list corresponding to each integer in the input list `numbers`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t` (the number of test cases).
   - It then reads `n` for each test case and stores them in the `numbers` list.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, are initialized with zeros up to `max(numbers) + 1`.
   - A variable `total` is initialized to 0.
   - The first 10 values are precomputed directly (i.e., `values[i] = i` for `i` from 0 to 9).

3. **Precomputing Values:**
   - For numbers from 10 to `n`, the program computes the sum of digits and updates the `values` and `sum_values` lists.
     - For each number `i` from 10 to `n`:
       - Convert the number to a string to access individual digits.
       - Extract the last digit (`last`) and the remaining part of the number (`remainder`).
       - Compute `values[i]` using previously computed values of the last digit and the remaining part.
       - Update `sum_total` and `sum_values[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the value from `sum_values` corresponding to the input `n`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Precomputation:**
   - The program attempts to precompute values for all numbers up to `max(numbers) + 1`, which is unnecessary and inefficient.
   - The precomputation logic for numbers from 10 to `n` is flawed because it does not handle the cumulative sum correctly.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The cumulative sum calculation (`sum_values[i] = sum_total`) is incorrect. It should be based on the sum of previous values plus the current value.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program processes all test cases together, which is not efficient. It should process each test case separately.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Read each test case individually.
2. Compute the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `n`.
3. Maintain a running total of these sums.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total_sum += sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
