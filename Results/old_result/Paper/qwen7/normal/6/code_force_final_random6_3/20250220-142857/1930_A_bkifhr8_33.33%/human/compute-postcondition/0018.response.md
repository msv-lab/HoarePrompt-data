Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `ans_f` is an empty list, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

In natural language: `t` must remain greater than 0, `i` remains 1, `ans` is now twice the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` because it was incremented by the minimum value of those two numbers, `ans_f` remains an empty list, and `n` must remain greater than 0.
