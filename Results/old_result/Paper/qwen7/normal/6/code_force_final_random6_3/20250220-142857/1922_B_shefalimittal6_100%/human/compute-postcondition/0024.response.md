Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is 3 + n; `cnt` is 0; each element `v[x]` in the list `v` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` as it was updated in each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the value of `n` or `idx`, nor does it change the list `v`. Therefore, `n` remains greater than 0, `idx` remains 3 + n, and `v` is updated according to the original precondition. The only new information is that `cnt` is now 0.
