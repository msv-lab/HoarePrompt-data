Output State: **`c` is 12, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 8, `ans` is a list containing [-11, 16, -5, 256, -32769, 65536, 0, 0].**

Explanation: The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` such that its length matches `n`. Since `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state but can be inferred from the context as the length needed to match the pattern observed in `ans`, and given that `ans` should have 8 elements (as it cycles through `arr` and appends values), the list `ans` is extended by two zeros to make its length 8. Therefore, `ans` now contains the values [-11, 16, -5, 256, -32769, 65536, 0, 0]. The values of `c`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
