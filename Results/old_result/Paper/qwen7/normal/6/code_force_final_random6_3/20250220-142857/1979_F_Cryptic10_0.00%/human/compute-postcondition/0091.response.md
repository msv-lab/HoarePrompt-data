Output State: **`d` is `n-2`, `v` is a vertex, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` now contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and the vertex `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of the existing variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the preconditions and adds the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
